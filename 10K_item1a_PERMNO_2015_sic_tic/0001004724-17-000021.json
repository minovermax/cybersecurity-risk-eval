{"cik": "1004724", "company": "ADCARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, operations and financial condition. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. This section does not describe all risks applicable to our business, and we intend it only as a summary of certain material factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock and our 10.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) could decline.\nRisks Related to the Delisting of Our Securities\nIf we fail to meet all applicable continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT and the NYSE MKT determines to delist the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of such securities, impair the value of your investment, adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds and subject us to additional trading restrictions and regulations.\nOn April 18, 2016, the Company received notice from NYSE Regulation, Inc. (\u201cNYSE Regulation\u201d) that it is not in compliance with certain NYSE MKT continued listing standards relating to stockholders\u2019 equity. Specifically, the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.0 million or more if an issuer has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years), Section 1003(a)(ii) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $4.0 million or more if an issuer has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years) and Section 1003(a)(iii) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more if an issuer has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (Collectively, the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Equity Continued Listing Standards\u201d) because the Company reported a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $23.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and net losses for the last five fiscal years.\nAs a result, the Company became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide and was required to submit a plan (a \u201cCompliance Plan\u201d) by May 18, 2016 describing the actions the Company has taken or will take to regain compliance with the Stockholders\u2019 Equity Continued Listing Standards during the period ending October 18, 2017 (the \u201cPlan Period\u201d).The Company submitted a Compliance Plan by the May 18, 2016 deadline and was notified on June 2, 2016 that the NYSE Regulation had accepted the Compliance Plan.\nDuring the Plan Period, the Company is subject to periodic review by NYSE MKT, and the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE MKT pursuant to an extension granted by NYSE Regulation. If the Company is not in compliance with Stockholders\u2019 Equity Continued Listing Standards by October 18, 2017, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with its Compliance Plan during the Plan Period, then NYSE Regulation will initiate delisting proceedings.\nIf the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are delisted from the NYSE MKT, such securities may trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and any security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in such securities, further limiting the liquidity of the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from the NYSE MKT and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. Any such limitations on our ability to raise debt and equity capital could prevent us from making future investments and satisfying maturing debt commitments.\nIn addition, if the Company fails for 180 or more consecutive days to maintain a listing of the Series A Preferred Stock on a national exchange, then: (i) the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock will be increased from 10.875% per annum to 12.875% per annum on the 181st day; and (ii) the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to serve on the Board. Such increased dividend rate and voting rights will continue for so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is not listed on a national exchange.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to resolve our professional and general liability actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company is a defendant in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims that the services the Company provided during the time it operated skilled nursing facilities resulted in injury or death to former patients. Although the Company settles cases from time to time if settlement can be achieved on a reasonable basis, the Company vigorously defends any matter in which it believes the claims lack merit and the Company has a reasonable chance to prevail at trial or in arbitration. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and there is risk in the Company's strategy of aggressively defending these cases. There is no assurance that the outcomes of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company is a defendant in 44 professional and general liability actions commenced on behalf of former patients, of which 28 cases were filed in the State of Arkansas by the same plaintiff attorney who represented the plaintiffs in a purported class action lawsuit against the Company previously disclosed as the Amy Cleveland Class Action which settled in December 2015. These actions generally seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for former patients of the Company who were allegedly injured or died while patients of facilities operated by the Company due to professional negligence or understaffing. Three of the pending actions are covered by insurance, except that any award of punitive damages would be excluded from such coverage.\nThe Company has self-insured against professional and general liability claims since it discontinued its healthcare operations in connection with its Transition. The Company has established a self-insurance reserve for estimated costs associated with its professional liability claims, included within \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d in the Company\u2019s audited consolidated balance sheets, of $0.2 million and $6.9 million at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2016, respectively. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8., \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Also see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Self Insurance Reserve\u201d and \u201c Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Requirements\u201d in Part II, Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe Company currently believes that most of these actions, and particularly many of the most recently filed actions, are defensible and intends to defend them through final judgment. Accordingly, the self-insurance reserve primarily reflects the Company's estimated legal costs of litigating the pending actions accordingly.\nThe amount of the self-insurance reserve may not be sufficient to cover the legal costs actually incurred in litigating the pending actions, and the amount of the self-insurance reserve may increase, perhaps by a material amount, in any given period, particularly if the Company determines that it has probable exposure in one or more actions. If we are unable to resolve the pending actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may incur losses in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $7.5 million compared to a net loss of $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We make no assurances that we will be able to operate profitably. As of December 31, 2016, we have a working capital deficit of approximately $4.8 million.\nOur leases with tenants comprise our rental revenue and any failure, inability or unwillingness by these tenants to satisfy their obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business depends upon our tenants meeting their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent, maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate and other taxes and maintain and repair the leased properties. We cannot assure you that these tenants will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by these tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any failure by these tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that our tenants will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations.\nWe depend on affiliates of C.R Management and Beacon Health Management for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by such entities to satisfy their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur 29 properties (including the three facilities that are managed by us) are operated by a total of 29 separate tenants, with each of our tenants being affiliated with one of six local or regionally-focused operators. Each of our operators operate (through a group of affiliated tenants) between two and seven of our facilities, with our most significant operators C.R Management and Beacon Health Management, each operating (through a group of affiliated tenants) seven facilities, or 24% of the total number of our facilities. We accordingly depend on our tenants who are affiliated C.R Management and Beacon Health Management for a significant portion of our revenues. Because our leases and subleases with our tenants who are affiliated with C.R Management and Beacon Health Management are on a triple-net basis, we also depend on such tenants to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased and subleased properties. We cannot assure you that the tenants affiliated with C.R Management and Beacon Health Management will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their obligations under the applicable leases and subleases, and any inability or unwillingness by such tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could adversely impact the results of operations of our tenants, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nWe believe the risks associated with our investments will be more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession (such as the most recent recession) due to the adverse impact caused by various factors, including inflation, deflation, increased unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, a distressed real estate market, market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. This difficult operating environment caused by an economic slowdown or recession could have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants to maintain occupancy rates, which could harm their financial condition. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses by our tenants could adversely affect our income from investments in our portfolio.\nIncreased competition, as well as increased operating costs, could result in lower revenues for some of our tenants and may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nThe long-term care industry is highly competitive, and we expect that it will become more competitive in the future. Our tenants are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Our tenants compete on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding areas. We cannot be certain that the tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract patients or residents or expand their businesses and, therefore, affect their ability to make their lease payments.\nIn addition, the market for qualified nurses, healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive, and our tenants may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our tenants could affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. This situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements.\nDisasters and other adverse events may seriously harm our business.\nOur facilities and our business may suffer harm as a result of natural or man-made disasters such as storms, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and other conditions. The impact, or impending threat, of such events may require that our tenants evacuate one or more facilities, which could be costly and would involve risks, including potentially fatal risks, for their patients. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Such events could harm our tenants\u2019 patients and employees, severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, harm our tenants\u2019 business, reputation and financial performance, or otherwise cause our tenants\u2019 businesses to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nA severe cold and flu season, epidemics, or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our tenants\u2019 facilities.\nOur and our tenants\u2019 revenues are dependent upon occupancy. It is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. The occupancy of our skilled nursing and assisted living facilities\ncould significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic, or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our tenants and the ability of our tenants to make payments to us.\nThe bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants could limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new tenants.\nWe are exposed to the risk that a distressed tenant may not be able to meet its obligations to us or other third parties. This risk is heightened during a period of economic or political instability. We are also exposed to increased risk in situations where we lease multiple properties to a single tenant (or affiliated tenants) under a master lease, as a tenant failure or default could reduce or eliminate rental revenue from multiple properties. If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases, then we may be forced to modify the leases in ways that are unfavorable to us. Alternatively, the failure of a tenant to perform under a lease could require us to declare a default, repossess the property, find a suitable replacement tenant, hire third-party managers to operate the property or sell the property. There is no assurance that we would be able to lease a property on substantially equivalent or better terms than the prior lease, or at all, find another qualified tenant, successfully reposition the property for other uses or sell the property on terms that are favorable to us. It may be more difficult to find a replacement tenant for a healthcare property than it would be to find a replacement tenant for a general commercial property due to the specialized nature of the business. Even if we are able to find a suitable replacement tenant for a property, transfers of operations of skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations, which may affect our ability to successfully transition a property.\nIf any lease expires or is terminated, then we could be responsible for all of the operating expenses for that property until it is leased again or sold. If a significant number of our properties are unleased, then our operating expenses could increase significantly. Any significant increase in our operating costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Furthermore, to the extent we operate such property for an indeterminate amount of time, we would be subject to the various risks our tenants assume as operators and potentially fail to qualify as a REIT in any given year.\nAlthough each of our lease agreements typically provides us with, or will provide us with, the right to terminate, evict a tenant, foreclose on our collateral, demand immediate payment and exercise other remedies upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of a tenant, the law relating to bankruptcy as codified and enacted as Title 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\") would limit or, at a minimum, delay our ability to collect unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents and to pursue other remedies against a bankrupt tenant. A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents or evicting the tenant absent approval of the bankruptcy court. The Bankruptcy Code provides a tenant with the option to assume or reject an unexpired lease within certain specified periods of time. Generally, a lessee is required to pay all rent that becomes payable between the date of its bankruptcy filing and the date of the assumption or rejection of the lease (although such payments will likely be delayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing). Any tenant that chooses to assume its lease with us must cure all monetary defaults existing under the lease (including payment of unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents) and provide adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations under the lease. Any tenant that opts to reject its lease with us would face a claim by us for unpaid and future rents payable under the lease, but such claim would be subject to a statutory \u201ccap\u201d and would generally result in a recovery substantially less than the face value of such claim. Although the tenant\u2019s rejection of the lease would permit us to recover possession of the leased facility, we would likely face losses, costs and delays associated with re-leasing the facility to a new tenant.\nSeveral other factors could impact our rights under leases with bankrupt tenants. First, the tenant could seek to assign its lease with us to a third party. The Bankruptcy Code generally disregards anti-assignment provisions in leases to permit the assignment of unexpired leases to third parties (provided all monetary defaults under the lease are cured and the third party can demonstrate its ability to perform its obligations under the lease). Second, in instances in which we have entered into a master lease agreement with a tenant that operates more than one facility, the bankruptcy court could determine that the master lease was comprised of separate, divisible leases (each of which could be separately assumed or rejected), rather than a single, integrated lease (which would have to be assumed or rejected in its entirety). Finally, the bankruptcy court could recharacterize our lease agreement as a disguised financing arrangement, which could require us to receive bankruptcy court approval to foreclose or pursue other remedies with respect to the facility.\nIn 2016, New Beginnings and its affiliates (including a former tenant of the Company), who operated the Oceanside Facility, the Savannah Beach Facility and the Jeffersonville Facility, filed petitions to reorganize their finances under the Bankruptcy Code. We give no assurance that our current tenants will not undergo bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration that could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we must replace any of our tenants, we might be unable to rent the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. If any of our triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to rent those properties to another tenant. In addition, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant. We also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate and bed taxes, and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. In addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses. Any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMoreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants\u2019 lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. Our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. Any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur tenants may be subject to significant legal actions that could result in their increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nAs is typical in the long term care industry, our tenants may be subject to claims for damages relating to the services that they provide. We give no assurance that the insurance coverage maintained by our tenants will cover all claims made against them or continue to be available at a reasonable cost, if at all. In some states, insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages may not, in certain cases, be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability. As a result, our tenants doing business in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered by their insurance or are in excess of their insurance policy limits.\nWe also believe that there has been, and will continue to be, an increase in governmental investigations of long-term care providers, particularly in the area of Medicare/Medicaid false claims, as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations. The OIG, the enforcement arm of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, formulates a formal work plan each year for nursing centers. The OIG\u2019s most recent work plan indicates that, among other things, the OIG\u2019s investigative and review focus in 2017 for nursing facilities will include complaint investigations by state agencies, unreported incidents of potential abuse and neglect, reimbursement, background checks, compliance with prospective payment requirements, and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. We cannot predict the likelihood, scope or outcome of any such investigations and reviews with respect to our facilities or our tenants. Insurance is not available to our tenants to cover such losses. Any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation, whether currently asserted or arising in the future, could have a material adverse effect on a tenant\u2019s financial condition. If a tenant is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage, if a tenant is required to pay uninsured punitive damages, or if a tenant is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action, then such tenant could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities. Such liabilities could adversely affect a tenant\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to us.\nIn addition, we may, in some circumstances, be named as a defendant in litigation involving the services provided by our tenants. Although we generally have no involvement in the services provided by our tenants, and our standard lease agreements generally require (or will require) our tenants to indemnify us and carry insurance to cover us in certain cases, a significant judgment against us in such litigation could exceed our and our tenants\u2019 insurance coverage, which would require us to make payments to cover any such judgment.\nOur tenants may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute.\nOur tenants who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any of these lawsuits were brought against our tenants, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by policies maintained by our tenants may not adequately insure against losses.\nWe maintain or require in our leases that our tenants maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. Although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance maintained by our tenants and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot assure you that our tenants will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. We also cannot assure you that our tenants will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our leases, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite the policies maintained by our tenants.\nFor various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. Companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. As a result, the tenants of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. If tenants of our properties decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us.\nShould an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.\nFailure by our tenants to comply with various local, state and federal government regulations may adversely impact their ability to make lease payments to us.\nHealthcare operators are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those described below, that are subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from new legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. Although we cannot accurately predict the ultimate timing or effect of these changes, such changes could have a material effect on our tenants\u2019 costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our tenants to comply with these laws, requirements and regulations could adversely affect its ability to meet its obligations to us.\n\u2022\nHealthcare Reform. The Healthcare Reform Law, which was signed into law in March 2010, represents the most comprehensive change to healthcare benefits since the inception of the Medicare program in 1965 and affects reimbursement for governmental programs, private insurance and employee welfare benefit plans in various ways. Among other things, the Healthcare Reform Law expands Medicaid eligibility, requires most individuals to have health insurance, establishes new regulations for health plans, creates health insurance exchanges, and modifies certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste, including through new tools to address fraud and abuse. We cannot accurately predict the impact of the Healthcare Reform Law on our tenants or their ability to meet their obligations to us.\n\u2022\nReimbursement; Medicare and Medicaid. A significant portion of the revenue of the healthcare operators to which we lease, or will lease, properties is, or will be, derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Failure to maintain certification in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs and could negatively impact an operator\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to us.\n\u2022\nQuality of Care Initiatives. CMS has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the quality of care provided by nursing homes that could affect our tenants. Any unsatisfactory rating of our tenants under any rating system promulgated by the CMS could result in the loss of patients or residents or lower reimbursement rates, which could adversely impact their revenues and our business.\n\u2022\nLicensing and Certification. Healthcare operators are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations, including laws and regulations under Medicare and Medicaid requiring operators to comply with extensive standards governing operations. Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency. Governmental agencies administering these laws and regulations regularly inspect facilities and investigate complaints. Failure to obtain any required licensure, certification, or CON, the loss or suspension of any required licensure, certification, or CON, or any violations or deficiencies with respect to relevant operating standards may require a facility to cease operations or result in ineligibility for reimbursement until the necessary licenses, certifications, or CON are obtained or reinstated or until any such violations or deficiencies are cured. In such event, our revenues from these facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently.\n\u2022\nFraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations. There are various federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing a wide array of healthcare provider referrals, relationships and arrangements, including laws and regulations prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers. In addition, the Stark Law broadly defines the scope of prohibited physician referrals under federal health care programs to providers with which they have ownership or other financial arrangements. Many states have adopted, or are considering, legislative proposals similar to these laws, some of which extend beyond federal health care programs, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care. Many of these complex laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted by the relevant governmental authorities and courts. We cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with responsibility for enforcing the provisions of these laws and regulations will not assert that one or more of our arrangements are in violation of the provisions of such laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti-fraud initiatives against healthcare providers. The violation of any of these laws or regulations by any of our tenants may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties, including exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and all other federal and state healthcare programs. Such fines or penalties could jeopardize a tenant\u2019s ability to make lease payments to us or to continue operating its facility.\n\u2022\nPrivacy Laws. Healthcare operators are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy and security of patient health information. These laws and regulations require operators to expend the requisite resources to protect and secure patient health information, including the funding of costs associated with technology upgrades. Operators found in violation of these laws may face large penalties. In addition, compliance with an operator\u2019s notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information could cause reputational harm to an operator\u2019s business. Such penalties and damaged reputation could adversely affect a tenant\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to us.\n\u2022\nOther Laws. Other federal, state and local laws and regulations affect how our tenants conduct their business. We cannot accurately predict the effect that the costs of complying with these laws may have on the revenues of our tenants and, thus, their ability to meet their obligations to us.\n\u2022\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments. Each year, legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal, state and local levels that, if adopted, would result in major changes to the healthcare system in addition to those described herein. We cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted and, if adopted, what effect (if any) these proposals would have on our tenants or our business.\nOur tenants may be adversely affected by healthcare regulation and enforcement.\nRegulation of the long-term healthcare industry generally has intensified over time both in the number and type of regulations and in the efforts to enforce those regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers. Federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient rights, fraudulent or abusive behavior, data privacy and security, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. In addition, changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have resulted in an increase in the number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory\nsanctions, including terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and even criminal penalties. We are unable to predict the scope of future federal, state and local regulations and legislation, including the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf our tenants fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations. Our tenants also could face increased costs related to healthcare regulation, such as the Healthcare Reform Law, or be forced to expend considerable resources in responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. In such event, the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated or managed by those entities could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe impact of healthcare reform legislation on our tenants cannot be accurately predicted.\nThe health care industry in the United States is subject to fundamental changes due to ongoing health care reform efforts and related political, economic and regulatory influences. Notably, the Healthcare Reform Law resulted in expanded health care coverage to millions of previously uninsured people beginning in 2014 and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. health care system. To help fund this expansion, the Healthcare Reform Law outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursements for various health care providers, including skilled nursing facilities, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment methodologies.\nSeveral provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law affect Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities, including provisions changing Medicare payment methodology and implementing value-based purchasing and payment bundling. Although we cannot accurately predict how all of these provisions may be implemented, or the effect any such implementation would have on our tenants or our business, the Healthcare Reform Law could result in decreases in payments to our tenants, increase our tenants\u2019 costs or otherwise adversely affect the financial condition of our tenants, thereby negatively impacting their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nThe Healthcare Reform Law also requires skilled nursing facilities to have a compliance and ethics program that is effective in preventing and detecting criminal, civil and administrative violations and in promoting quality of care. If our tenants fall short in their compliance and ethics programs and quality assurance and performance improvement programs, then their reputations and ability to attract residents could be adversely affected.\nThis comprehensive health care legislation has resulted and will continue to result in extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities, and also may be altered or amended. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Healthcare Reform Law due to the complexity of the law and implementing regulations, as well our inability to foresee how CMS and other participants in the health care industry will respond to the choices available to them under the law. We also cannot accurately predict whether any new or pending legislative proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals would have on our tenants\u2019 business. Similarly, while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal health care programs, we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on their business and therefore on our business. The provisions of the legislation and other regulations implementing the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law may increase our tenants\u2019 costs or otherwise adversely affect the financial condition of our tenants, thereby negatively impacting their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Reform Law was enacted that also may impact our business. For instance, on April 1, 2014, President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which, among other things, requires CMS to measure, track, and publish readmission rates of skilled nursing facilities by 2017 and implement a value-based purchasing program for skilled nursing facilities (the \u201cSNF VBP Program\u201d) by October 1, 2018. The SNF VBP Program will increase Medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing facilities that achieve certain levels of quality performance measures to be developed by CMS, relative to other facilities. The value-based payments authorized by the SNF VBP Program will be funded by reducing Medicare payment for all skilled nursing facilities by 2% and redistributing up to 70% of those funds to high-performing skilled nursing facilities. If Medicare reimbursement provided to our tenants is reduced under the SNF VBP Program, that reduction may have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us.\nOur tenants depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors, and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced.\nChanges in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our tenants could result in a substantial reduction in the revenues and operating margins of our tenants. Significant limits on the scopes of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants, which could cause their revenues to decline and could negatively impact their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nAdditionally, net revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, additional documentation is necessary or certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. New legislative and regulatory proposals could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. No assurance is given that adequate third-party payor reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our tenants.\nThe Healthcare Reform Law provides those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Healthcare Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows states to elect not to participate in the expansion-and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion-without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early February 2016, roughly half of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants\u2019 revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. While the federal government will pay for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 through 2016, states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017. In light of this, at least one state that has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its Medicaid coverage has included sunset provisions in the legislation that require that the expanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government\u2019s funding for the program is decreased or eliminated, permitting the state to re-visit the issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion. With increasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states that do not include such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additional Medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a result. A significant reduction in other health care related spending by states to pay for increased Medicaid costs could affect our tenants\u2019 revenue streams.\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state Medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade. We can expect that federal authorities will continue to implement the law, but because of the Supreme Court\u2019s mixed ruling, the implementation will take longer than originally expected, with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare.\nA repeal of the Healthcare Reform Law, in whole or in part, may have unforeseen consequences.\nIt is possible that following the inauguration of President Trump, which occurred on January 20, 2017, legislation will be introduced and passed by the Republican-controlled Congress repealing the Healthcare Reform Law in whole or in part and signed into law by President Trump, consistent with statements made by him during his presidential campaign indicating his intention to do so within a short time following his inauguration. It is also possible that this may be accomplished in part through the issuance of presidential executive orders. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the Healthcare Reform Law, including the potential for further legal challenges or repeal of that legislation, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the Healthcare Reform Law or its repeal on our tenants and, thus, their ability to meet their obligations to us. We also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislative or policy changes or implementations affecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We cannot provide assurances as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislative or policy changes on our tenants and, thus, their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nGovernment budget deficits could lead to a reduction in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.\nMany states are focusing on the reduction of expenditures under their Medicaid programs, which may result in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our tenants. These potential reductions could be compounded by the potential for federal cost-cutting efforts that could lead to reductions in reimbursement to our tenants under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to our tenants could reduce the cash flow of our tenants and their ability to make rent payments to us. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in Medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Because the Healthcare Reform Law allows states to increase the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid and simplifies enrollment in this program, Medicaid enrollment may significantly increase in the future. Since our tenants\u2019 profit margins with respect to Medicaid patients are generally relatively low, more than modest reductions in Medicaid reimbursement and an increase in the number of Medicaid patients could place some tenants in financial distress, which, in turn, could adversely affect us. If funding for Medicare or Medicaid is reduced, then it could have a material adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants.\nOur tenants rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare (both traditional Medicare and \"managed\" Medicare/Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. Federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider Medicaid rate freezes or cuts. Private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that our tenants who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property, or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of our tenants, which could affect adversely their ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new healthcare properties could reduce our profitability.\nOur business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful. For example, we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to our acquired healthcare properties, including contingent liabilities, or our newly acquired healthcare properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. Such costs may negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur real estate investments are relatively illiquid.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, all of our owned healthcare properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and may not be readily sold. Additional factors that are specific to our industry also tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. For example, all of our healthcare properties are \u201cspecial purpose\u201d properties that cannot be readily converted into general residential, retail or office use. In addition, transfers of operations of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and other healthcare facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. Thus, if the operation of any of our healthcare properties becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of improvements or other factors such that a tenant becomes unable to meet its obligations to us, then the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less, particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan, than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses. Furthermore, the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of a tenant that has defaulted on its lease could be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the tenant with a new tenant licensed to manage the facility. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. Should such events occur, our revenues would be adversely affected.\nAs an owner with respect to real property, we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner of real property, such as us, may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of, or related releases of, certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability based on the owner\u2019s knowledge of, or responsibility for, the presence or disposal of such substances. As a result, liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property.\nThe cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner\u2019s liability therefor could exceed the value of the property and the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect an operator\u2019s ability to attract additional patients or residents and our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could negatively impact our revenues.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nOur business is highly competitive, and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. We compete for healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors, many of which have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment criteria. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient number of healthcare facilities at favorable prices, or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors, the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease rates.\nThe geographic concentration of our facilities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn or adverse regulatory changes in those areas.\nOur properties are located in six states, with concentrations in Georgia and Ohio. As a result of this concentration, the conditions of local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules, regulations and reimbursement rates or criteria, changes in demographics, state funding, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand and reimbursement for skilled nursing services in these states could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 revenue, costs and results of operations, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and our future success depends largely upon the management experience, skill, and contacts of our management and the loss of any of our key management team could harm our business. If we lose the services of any or all of our management team, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur directors and officers substantially control all major decisions.\nOur directors and officers beneficially own a significant number of shares of our outstanding common stock. Therefore, our directors and officers will be able to influence major corporate actions required to be voted on by shareholders, such as the election of directors, the amendment of our charter documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, reorganizations, sales of substantially all of our assets and liquidation. Furthermore, our directors will be able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock, implement stock repurchase programs and incur indebtedness. This control may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $80.0 million in indebtedness, including current maturities of debt. We may also obtain additional short-term and long-term debt to meet future capital needs, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, which would increase our total debt. Our substantial amount of debt could have negative consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to interest and principal payments on outstanding debt, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow for dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain certain debt coverage and other financial ratios at specified levels, thereby reducing our financial flexibility;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nexpose us to increases in interest rates for our variable rate debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms, or at all, for working capital, debt service requirements, expansion of our business or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity on the same or more favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements. If we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants contained in those agreements, or are unable to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, the lenders and other parties to those arrangements could accelerate the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs.\nFor the year ended and as of December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $7.5 million and negative working capital of $4.8 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $14.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as restricted cash of $5.5 million, and $80.0 million in indebtedness, including current maturities of $13.2 million.\nWe continue to undertake measures to further streamline our operations and cost infrastructure in connection with our new business model, including: (i) refinancing indebtedness to reduce interest costs and mandatory principal repayments; and (ii) reducing general and administrative expenses.\nManagement anticipates both access to and receipt of several sources of liquidity, including cash from operations and cash on hand. We have routine ongoing discussions with existing and potential new lenders to refinance current debt on a longer-term basis and, in recent periods, have refinanced short-term acquisition-related debt with traditional long-term mortgage notes, some of which have been executed under government guaranteed lending programs. We have been successful in recent years in raising new equity capital and believe, based on recent discussions, that these markets will continue to be available to us for raising capital in 2017 and beyond.\nIn order to satisfy the Company\u2019s capital needs, the Company seeks to: (i) refinance debt where possible to obtain more favorable terms; (ii) raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities; and (iii) increase operating cash flows through acquisitions. The Company anticipates that these actions, if successful, will provide the opportunity to maintain its liquidity, thereby permitting the Company to better meet its operating and financing obligations. However, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful. Management\u2019s ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities and the terms upon which\nwe are able to raise such capital may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain the listing of the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock on the NYSE MKT.\nWe rely on external sources of capital to fund our capital needs, and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing debt commitments.\nWe rely on external sources of capital, including private or public offerings of debt or equity, the assumption of secured indebtedness, or mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including the performance of the national and global economies generally; competition in the healthcare industry; issues facing the healthcare industry, including regulations and government reimbursement policies; our tenants\u2019 operating costs; the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential; the market value of our properties; our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends; on its common stock and preferred stock, if any; and the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We may not be in a position to take advantage of future investment opportunities if we are unable to access capital markets on a timely basis or are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms.\nIn particular, we are subject to risks associated with debt financing, which could negatively impact our business and limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repay maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay our maturing indebtedness. Furthermore, if we have to pay higher interest rates in connection with a refinancing, the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase, which could reduce our profitability. Moreover, additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage. The degree of leverage could have important consequences to our shareholders, including affecting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our results of operations or the economy in general.\nOur ability to raise capital through equity sales is dependent, in part, on the market price of our stock, and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively impact the market price of our stock and availability of equity capital.\nAs with other publicly-traded companies, the availability of equity capital will depend, in part, on the market price of our stock, which, in turn, will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent of investor interest;\n\u2022\nour financial performance and that of our tenants;\n\u2022\ngeneral stock and bond market conditions; and\n\u2022\nother factors such as governmental regulatory action.\nCovenants in the agreements evidencing our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations.\nThe terms of our credit agreements and other agreements evidencing our indebtedness require us to comply with a number of financial and other covenants which may limit management\u2019s discretion by restricting our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, and create liens. Any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness and conduct our operations is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. Any such breach could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur assets may be subject to impairment charges.\nWe periodically, but not less than annually, evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, operator performance and legal structure. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, then we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nWe may change our investment strategies and policies and capital structure.\nThe Board, without the approval of our shareholders, may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines that a change is in our shareholders\u2019 best interests. The methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed.\nEconomic conditions and turbulence in the credit markets may create challenges in securing indebtedness or refinancing our existing indebtedness.\nDepressed economic conditions, the availability and cost of credit, turmoil in the mortgage market and depressed real estate markets have in the past contributed, and will in the future contribute, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets and the economy as a whole. Significant market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to secure indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness.\nWe are subject to possible conflicts of interest; we have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, transactions with parties that may be considered related parties.\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in various transactions with related parties including Christopher Brogdon, a former director and owner of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock. See Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - \"Related Party Transactions\".\nAlthough we do not believe the potential conflicts have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, our business, others may disagree with this position and litigation could ensue in the future. Our relationships with Mr. Brogdon and other related parties may give rise to litigation, or other issues which could result in substantial costs to us, and a diversion of our resources and management's attention, whether or not any allegations made are substantiated.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe price of our stock has fluctuated, and a number of factors may cause the price of our stock to decline.\nThe market price of our stock has fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly in the future, depending upon many factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial condition, performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and market conditions and other external factors;\n\u2022\nthe market price of securities issued by other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships or other transactions;\n\u2022\npress releases or negative publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in healthcare;\n\u2022\ngovernment action or regulation, including changes in federal, state and local healthcare regulations to which our tenants are subject;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates, our ability to meet those estimates, or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock, our Series A Preferred Stock or another series of our preferred stock, or debt securities.\nIn addition, the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock also depends upon:\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\ntrading prices of preferred equity securities issued by other companies in our industry; and\n\u2022\nthe annual yield from distributions on our Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments.\nFurthermore, the stock market in recent years has experienced sweeping price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the price of our stock to decline.\nIn the event of fluctuations in the price of our stock, shareholders may be unable to resell shares of our stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares. Additionally, due to fluctuations in the price of our stock, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on past results as an indication of future performance.\nThere are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nWe are a holding company, and we have no significant operations. We rely primarily on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us so we may, among other things, pay dividends on our capital stock, if and to the extent declared by the Board. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other distributions to us depends on their earnings and may be restricted in the future by the terms of certain agreements governing their indebtedness. If our subsidiaries are in default under such agreements, then they may not pay dividends or make other distributions to us.\nIn addition, we may only pay dividends on our capital stock if we have funds legally available to pay dividends and such payment is not restricted or prohibited by law, the terms of any shares with higher priority with respect to dividends or any documents governing our indebtedness. We are restricted by Georgia law from paying dividends on our capital stock if we are not able to pay our debts as they become due in the normal course of business or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy preferential rights upon dissolution. In addition, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock unless full cumulative dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payments, for all past dividend periods. In addition, future debt, contractual covenants or arrangements we or our subsidiaries enter into may restrict or prevent future dividend payments.\nAs such, we could become unable, on a temporary or permanent basis, to pay dividends on our stock, including our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock. The payment of any future dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend, among other things, on the earnings and results of operations of our subsidiaries, their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to us under agreements governing their indebtedness, our financial condition and capital requirements, any debt service requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nThe costs of being publicly owned may strain our resources and impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. We are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThese requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources and have required us, and may in the future require us, to hire additional accounting and financial resources with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. In addition, failure to maintain such internal controls could result in us being unable to provide timely and reliable financial information which could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or cause us to be late in the filing of required reports or financial results. Any of the foregoing events could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nProvisions in Georgia law and our charter documents may delay or prevent a change in control or management that shareholders may consider desirable.\nVarious provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the \u201cGBCC\u201d) and of our charter documents may inhibit changes in control not approved by the Board and may have the effect of depriving our investors of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock and other securities in the event of an attempted hostile takeover. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of shareholders be called by the Board, the Chairman, the President, or the holders of shares with voting power of at least 25%;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\na requirement that directors may only be removed for cause and then only by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast in the election of such directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition of shareholder action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\navailability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock; and\n\u2022\na charter \u201cconstituency\u201d clause authorizing (but not requiring) our directors to consider, in discharging their duties as directors, the effects of the Company\u2019s actions on other interests and persons in addition to our shareholders.\nIn addition, the Company has elected in its bylaws to be subject to the \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions of the GBCC. The business combination provisions generally restrict us from engaging in certain business combination transactions with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (as defined in the GBCC) for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless certain designated conditions are met. The fair price provisions generally restricts us from entering into certain business combinations with an interested shareholder unless the transaction is unanimously approved by the continuing directors who must constitute at least three members of the Board at the time of such approval; or the transaction is recommended by at least two-thirds of the continuing directors and approved by a majority of the shareholders excluding the interested shareholder.\nThe Board can use these and other provisions to prevent, delay or discourage a change in control of the Company or a change in our management. Any such delay or prevention of a change in control or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a takeover transaction pursuant to which our shareholders could receive a substantial premium over the current market price of our common stock and other securities, which in turn may limit the price investors might be willing to pay for such securities.", "PERMNO": 91627, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "RHE"}
