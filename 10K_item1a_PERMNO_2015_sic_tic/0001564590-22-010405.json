{"cik": "31235", "company": "EASTMAN KODAK CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks and uncertainties. The risk factors described below, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in our securities risky. You should consider carefully these risks and uncertainties in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Kodak\u2019s Business and Operations\nKodak\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, or another global health crisis could have material adverse impacts on Kodak\u2019s employees, suppliers, customers, and others\u2019 ability to conduct business. The negative effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have, and may continue to have, material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected large segments of the global economy, including the markets in which we operate.\nThe pandemic and actions undertaken in response to the pandemic by Kodak, governmental bodies or other groups may have a material adverse effect on our business or our suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions or interruptions in shipping, manufacturing or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers\u2019 ability to make payments.\nWe have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased cost of raw materials and labor, the availability of raw materials and component products, delays in shipping and transportation and slow recovery of customer demand. Kodak\u2019s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have significantly increased, and will likely continue to increase. Ongoing disruptions in our supply chain could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and services. Adverse operational and economic circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response to the pandemic. For additional discussion regarding known impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201c in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate our business.\nContinued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing Kodak\u2019s debt require a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with financing and monetization transactions over the past several years. Kodak\u2019s stable and remaining growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows and investments needed for certain growth businesses.\nIt may take Kodak longer to generate positive cash flow from operations than planned, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position. If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations for an extended period in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations, our ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited.\nKodak\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. There are no assurances:\n\u2022\nKodak\u2019s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;\n\u2022\nKodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;\n\u2022\nthe Company will meet all the conditions associated with borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nKodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of our business and restructuring plan;\n\u2022\nKodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or\n\u2022\nFuture sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of our liquidity needs.\nKodak\u2019s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the senior secured first lien term loans (the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) borrowed under the Credit Agreement, dated February 26, 2021, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the \u201cTerm Loan Lenders\u201d), and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d), the 5.0% unsecured convertible notes held by the Term Loan Lenders (the \u201c2021 Convertible Notes\u201d), the 4.0% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d), and the 5.0% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d), or to fund Kodak\u2019s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements.\nIf Kodak cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company\u2019s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company\u2019s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce our ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak\u2019s liquidity needs.\nIf Kodak is unable to continue successful development, funding, and commercialization of products in businesses upon which we are focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, Kodak\u2019s financial performance could be adversely affected.\nKodak has focused our investments in print, advanced materials, and chemicals. These investment areas include offset plates and CTP devices, digital printing using commercial inkjet and electrophotography, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals (including pharmaceutical products), coated materials used in electric vehicle/energy storage batteries and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, Kodak\u2019s strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that Kodak\u2019s ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing our investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of our target customers, Kodak\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nIf Kodak is unable to successfully or timely implement cost structure reductions, Kodak\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nKodak continues to rationalize our workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with our business initiatives. There are no assurances that workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures will be successful or the cost savings or other beneficial results will be consistent with expectations. The extent of change across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to diminished results, compliance issues, and harm to our reputation. If workforce reductions, restructuring efforts and other cost-saving measures are not effectively managed, Kodak may also experience lost sales, harm to our business and customer relationships, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees or other retention issues, product delays and increased costs.\nFinally, the timing and implementation of workforce reductions may require compliance with laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact Kodak\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of Kodak\u2019s key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nIn order to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees across the Company. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak\u2019s targeted growth markets, is critical to our future. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased attrition and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. Given that our business is highly technical and specialized, it would be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key employees. Kodak may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIf Kodak cannot effectively anticipate or rapidly respond to technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nKodak generally sells our products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Kodak\u2019s success depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To do so, Kodak must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products we provide to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve. Kodak\u2019s customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of Kodak\u2019s business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If Kodak does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to our current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate our businesses, products, and the markets we serve, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nThe success of Kodak\u2019s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of our competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak\u2019s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to our competitors, which could adversely affect our product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.\nKodak has reduced the scope of our corporate-focused research and development activities. If our investment in research and product development is inadequate, our response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services.\nKodak\u2019s investment in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\nCommercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak\u2019s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting our revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.\nNew products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s revenue.\nIf Kodak does not manage product reliability, yield and quality, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed.\nIn developing, commercializing and manufacturing our products and services, Kodak must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products.\nBecause Kodak\u2019s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines.\nUnanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although Kodak has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.\nAging manufacturing facilities and equipment could lead to failures of equipment and systems.\nKodak\u2019s manufacturing facilities are aged, and without significant updates to equipment and systems, will be more prone to failure. Capital improvements to manufacturing facilities are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology. The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base. If Kodak\u2019s equipment and systems experience a critical failure, we could experience an interruption of operations, manufacturing delays, increased costs associated with repairs or redesigns of systems and products, loss of sales and customers and damage to Kodak\u2019s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Kodak fails to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nKodak uses a variety of distribution methods to sell and deliver our products and services, including direct sales, third-party resellers, channel partners and distributors. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels across customer segments for our products and services is complex. Since each distribution method has distinct risks and financial implications, Kodak\u2019s failure to achieve the most advantageous delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nCyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak\u2019s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about our workforce, our customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation, any of which could lead to material adverse effects on Kodak\u2019s results of operations, business and financial condition.\nTo effectively manage our global business, Kodak depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak\u2019s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running our business.\nAttacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Therefore, the system controls and security measures Kodak and other third parties use to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents may not be sufficient to anticipate and identify these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures.\nKodak\u2019s IT systems contain critical information about our business, including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, business partners, and employees. Cyber-attacks, breaches or defects in our systems could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of our information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on Kodak\u2019s business and reputation.\nKodak also provides IT-based products and services to our customers, and operates services used by our customers and hosted by Kodak. A breach of our security or reliability measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our customers\u2019 operations or data privacy, which could expose Kodak to liability and reputational harm.\nKodak\u2019s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results.\nFrom time to time, Kodak may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives.\nIn order to successfully pursue strategic transactions, Kodak must identify suitable sellers, buyers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. Strategic transactions may involve the following risks and challenges that could negatively impact our results of operations:\n\u2022\nthe need to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our business;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nwrong, inaccurate or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated;\n\u2022\npotential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas;\n\u2022\nan increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\ncompetition for strategic transactions, which may increase transaction costs and the ability to identify opportunities;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be temporarily diverted; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.\nThere are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which we undertake or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s revenue, gross margins and profitability.\nFailure to successfully manage the development and improvement of IT systems could diminish or delay any anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nKodak is focused on improvements to IT systems to more effectively manage our global business and implement our strategic plans. If Kodak is unable to successfully manage the development, improvement and transition of IT systems, anticipated efficiencies and operational improvements may be delayed or diminished, and we may experience cost overruns, disruption in our operations, or other business or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s results of operations, business and financial condition.\nIf Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, or if third parties assert we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.\nA key differentiator for Kodak in many of our businesses is our technological advantage over competitors\u2019 products and solutions. Our technological advantage is supported by Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nAny of Kodak\u2019s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States.\nTherefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, some of Kodak\u2019s business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nKodak also licenses third parties to use our trademarks.\nIn an effort to preserve our trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of our trademarks and requires our licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of our trademarks by our licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak\u2019s licensees fail to do so, our trademark rights could be diluted and our reputation harmed by our licensees\u2019 activities. Also, failure by Kodak and our licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak\u2019s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak\u2019s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of our trademark rights.\nKodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect our intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of our licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak\u2019s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.\nIn addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak\u2019s ability to conduct our business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak\u2019s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios. Third parties may claim Kodak and our customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.\nSuch claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak\u2019s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if we believe the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on our business:\n\u2022\nclaims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nclaims of intellectual property infringement may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products;\n\u2022\neven if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party\u2019s contractual obligations; and\n\u2022\nif we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, Kodak\u2019s revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with some of our products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose Kodak\u2019s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition.\nImpacts of the war in Ukraine are likely to have an adverse impact on the global economy, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe war in Ukraine, actions taken by Russia, Ukraine and the international community responses, have caused, and will likely continue to cause, decreased availability of components and raw materials, increases in shipping, energy and raw material costs and increased transit times. While we do not believe that we or our suppliers obtain components or materials directly from Russian sources, Russia is a significant source of aluminum and electronic components to various suppliers that may impact our ability to secure these materials from our direct suppliers. Energy costs are a significant component of the cost of producing aluminum, and our aluminum suppliers are based in Europe and may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs resulting from the war in Ukraine. Any escalation of the war in Ukraine, continued transit delays, decreased availability of components and raw materials, increases in shipping, energy and raw material costs associated with the war in Ukraine and compliance with associated economic sanctions could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWeakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s financial performance and liquidity.\nThe global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak\u2019s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on our results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers\u2019 ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events, and our liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak\u2019s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect our ability to meet our anticipated cash needs, impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.\nFollowing an implementation period after the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, and as of 1 January 2021 the UK is no longer a member of the EU single market and customs union. The uncertainty concerning Brexit has also caused global stock market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. There may also be broader uncertainty over the position the United States will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries.\nThis uncertainty may impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with the Company, (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets and (iv) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside Kodak\u2019s control but may cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\nKodak\u2019s products and brand have worldwide recognition. Kodak\u2019s reputation, and the reputation of our brand, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers, distributors, channel partners, consumers and investors. Any harm to the reputation of Kodak or our brand could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business and financial condition. The value of Kodak\u2019s brand is reflected, in part, in our Brand segment, which licenses the Kodak brand for use by third parties in wide range of products. Consumers and the public may view the products and activities of brand licensees as the products and activities of Kodak. The measures Kodak undertakes to research and manage licensee relationships and assess the quality of their products may not be sufficient to protect against legal proceedings and reputational harm in the event that licensed products and services do not meet consumer expectations for quality and safety. Other factors that could dilute or damage the reputation of Kodak and our brand include the failure of products and services to meet customer expectations, litigation and government investigations, negative or inaccurate comments in the media, including social media, and failure to meet and manage customer and industry expectations regarding the impact of our business on matters of social responsibility and environmental sustainability.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak\u2019s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.\nThe markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for many of our products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of our competitors may:\n\u2022\nforesee the course of market developments more accurately than Kodak does;\n\u2022\nsell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services;\n\u2022\nhave the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost;\n\u2022\nhave better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost;\n\u2022\ndevelop stronger relationships with our suppliers or customers;\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do; or\n\u2022\nhave access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than we can obtain.\nAs a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or prices at levels which would allow us to compete effectively. Kodak\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue, gross margins and cash flow.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm Kodak\u2019s future revenue and financial condition.\nWorldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages or outages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, failure of critical infrastructure, medical epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political or economic instability, including war and protests, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could cause disruptions to Kodak\u2019s operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers and have material adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of Kodak\u2019s critical business functions, including our manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak\u2019s employees to physically work at our or our customers\u2019 locations due to disruptions in service could harm Kodak\u2019s operations, perhaps significantly.\nThe impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak\u2019s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.\nKodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners.\nKodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support our manufacturing, logistics, and business operations. To the extent we rely on third-parties, we face the risks that those third parties may not be able to:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nObtain supplies and materials necessary to deliver goods or services to Kodak\nMitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions;\nDevelop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nMaintain an adequate control environment; and\n\u2022\nQuickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak\u2019s products.\nSuppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service and supply as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at our suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier\u2019s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of our suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our cash flows and the reliability of our products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce our contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by our suppliers.\nOther supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, interruption of IT services, risks related to the duration and termination of our contracts with suppliers for components and materials, non-competitive pricing due to tariffs, and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be available or established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak\u2019s inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with our customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity. There is a risk that Kodak\u2019s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak\u2019s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.\nDue to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak\u2019s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nAs a result of Kodak\u2019s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nExchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and, at times, our sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all of our segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on Kodak\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nKodak faces additional costs and risks associated with our worldwide business operations.\nKodak\u2019s business is subject to additional costs and risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:\n\u2022\nsupport of multiple languages;\n\u2022\nrecruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products;\n\u2022\ncomplexity of managing international operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncommercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.;\n\u2022\nmultiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nlimitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;\n\u2022\nlimitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncomplications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability.\nAs a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.\nAn inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak\u2019s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position.\nThe competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require us to facilitate or provide financing to our customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for our products and services. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak\u2019s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, our revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Kodak\u2019s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets\nThe Company\u2019s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of our cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nThe Company has obligations for borrowed money or in connection with letters of credit under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), the cash collateralized Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the \u201cLC Credit Agreement\u201d), and the 2021 Convertible Notes (together, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d).\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and our other obligations could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in our securities. These include the following:\n\u2022\nKodak may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt Kodak may have incurred;\n\u2022\nWe could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes;\n\u2022\nWe will have to use a significant part of our cash flow or cash balances to make payments on our debt and Series B Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and\n\u2022\nadverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.\nThe Company cannot be sure cash generated from our businesses will be as high as we expect, or our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from our businesses or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s ability to fund our operations.\nThe availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak\u2019s cash.\nAvailability under the Company\u2019s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment less specified reserves as described in Note 8, \u201cDebt and Finance Leases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. With the exception of 2020 to 2021 with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kodak\u2019s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have been declining over the last several years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter.\nAvailability under the Company\u2019s LC Credit Agreement is based on cash collateral in an amount greater than or equal to 103% of the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding at any given time (the \u201cLC Cash Collateral\u201d).\nIf Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $46 million of letters of credit outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement and the $11.25 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, or if LC Cash Collateral is not maintained to support the 103% of the $44 million of letters of credit outstanding under the LC Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement\u2019s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nAdditional LC Cash Collateral would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs.\nIf the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, that would increase operational complexities for the Company. An event of default would occur under these circumstances if the Company is unable to remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement\u2019s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nKodak may desire additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us and/or may be limited.\nKodak may desire to raise additional capital, including to pursue additional growth opportunities, strategic transactions or additional reorganization initiatives or refinance or redeem outstanding debt or preferred stock. Because of Kodak\u2019s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, Kodak\u2019s access to the capital markets may be limited.\nKodak\u2019s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nCovenants in the Credit Agreements;\n\u2022\nObtaining a consent from the holders of Series B and C Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series B and C Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nInvestor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nOur financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nOur levels of debt and redemption obligations;\n\u2022\nOur ability to generate positive cash flow;\n\u2022\nOur ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales;\n\u2022\nOur requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements;\n\u2022\nOur current non-investment grade credit rating;\n\u2022\nOur long-term business prospects; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and capital market conditions.\nKodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to capitalize on growth or efficiency opportunities or refinancings we would otherwise like to pursue.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.\nA breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements could result in an event of default under these facilities.\nIf any default or event of default occurs under the LC Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company\u2019s outstanding obligations under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the agent under the LC Credit Agreement and ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders\u2019 commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or 2021 Convertible Notes and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or 2021 Convertible Notes, such holders may declare all of the Company\u2019s outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and 2021 Convertible Notes, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If applicable, the administrative agent under the LC Credit Agreement, ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement and the collateral agent for the 2021 Convertible Notes could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nThe current non-investment grade status and Kodak\u2019s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak\u2019s commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances our credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies.\nOur credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.\nIn carrying out our commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support our business.\nShould our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.\nIn particular, given the Company\u2019s current credit ratings we would be required, if requested, to provide up to $3 million of additional letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nLegal proceedings and governmental investigations associated with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announcement or in general could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nOn July 28, 2020, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (the \u201cDFC\u201d) announced (the \u201cDFC Announcement\u201d) the signing of a non-binding letter of interest to provide a subsidiary of the Company with a potential $765 million loan (the \u201cDFC Loan\u201d) to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, an initiative that would manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients for essential generic drugs (the \u201cDFC Pharmaceutical Project\u201d).\nThe DFC Announcement and circumstances surrounding it prompted congressional investigations, an SEC investigation and a New York Attorney General\u2019s investigation. In addition, lawsuits have been filed or threatened alleging various securities law violations and breaches of fiduciary duties based on circumstances surrounding the DFC Announcement. For further information on these investigations and lawsuits, see Note 11, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. The investigations and lawsuits associated with the DFC announcement have diverted, and may continue to divert, the attention of Kodak\u2019s employees, management and board of directors. In addition, the response to the DFC related investigations and lawsuits has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased legal expense and related costs. Kodak\u2019s insurance, to the extent maintained, is not expected to cover all costs associated with the investigations and legal proceedings. We are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings and investigations to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any governmental investigation or legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or stock price.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.\nRegulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak\u2019s business. Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nSuch laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others. In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\nKodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and Kodak periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of our policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators. Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak\u2019s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s results of operation or financial condition.\nFailure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nKodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information.\nThese laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. More recent examples of data privacy laws include the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), and Brazil\u2019s General Data Protection Law (\u201cLGPD\u201d).\nRecently enacted laws and regulations, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nRecent developments in the regulation of cross-border data transfers from the European Economic Area and countries with similar regimes, including enforcement decisions and regulatory guidance issued by key supervisory authorities, creates uncertainty as to our and our customers\u2019 ability to use platforms and processing services located in the U.S. and other non-adequate jurisdictions. While existing data transfer mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, remain valid, Kodak\u2019s use of these transfer mechanisms is subject to legal, regulatory and political pressure. Kodak anticipates spending additional time and expense to enable continued cross-border transfers as needed to operate our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThis environment demands Kodak continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across our businesses and geographies. While Kodak has taken steps to comply with the GDPR, other applicable data protection laws, and the regulations and guidance published by applicable regulators, our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance may not be fully successful. Despite Kodak\u2019s security controls over personal data, Kodak, may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nKodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nKodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of our products.\nNon-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak\u2019s properties may impact our ability to further develop or sell such properties.\nIf Kodak fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nKodak is required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d. The existence of a material weakness in Kodak\u2019s internal controls may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions, which could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition and otherwise have a material adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flow results of operations or the trading price of Kodak\u2019s stock.\nKodak may have additional tax liabilities.\nKodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nKodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.\nManagement\u2019s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.\nKodak\u2019s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.\nKodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nThe funded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak\u2019s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nIn past years, Kodak has experienced variability in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including variability in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and benefits. There can be no assurance we will succeed in limiting cost increases.\nKodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nKodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak\u2019s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe 1,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion rate of 9.5238 shares of common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, the 1,043,629 outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion rate of 10 shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, and the 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion rate of 100 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2021 Convertible Notes. The outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Convertible Notes are expected to increase as a result of the payment of dividends and interest in kind at a rate of 5.0% per annum. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock or 2021 Convertible Notes (collectively, the \u201cConvertible Securities\u201d), the Company\u2019s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of our outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 2021, the conversion of all Convertible Securities would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 22% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.\nIf Convertible Securities are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Securities will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Securities or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Securities, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.\nThe holder of the Series C Preferred Stock owns a large portion of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding securities, and the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and 2021 Convertible Notes each have the right to nominate one member for election to the Company\u2019s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.\nThe holder of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company\u2019s common stock have the right to vote and is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate.\nThe holder of the Series C Preferred Stock holds approximately 11% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. As a result, this holder may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval.\nThe holder of the Series C Preferred Stock also has the right to nominate one member for election to the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). This nomination right expires upon the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock or the holder ceasing to directly or indirectly hold at least a majority of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock purchased or the common stock received upon the conversion of such shares and is exclusive to the initial holder and does not transfer with the Series C Preferred Stock.\nAlso, an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders has the right to nominate one member for election to the Board until the third anniversary of the initial issuance of the Term Loans or until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, whichever is earlier. Until the Term Loan Lenders cease to hold at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, at any time that the director nominated by the affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders is not serving on the Board, such affiliate will have the right to designate a non-voting observer to the Board.\nAlso, if dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive dividend periods, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to nominate one director at the next annual shareholder meeting and all subsequent shareholder meetings until all accumulated dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside. As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holder of Series C Preferred Stock or an affiliate of the Term Loan Lenders or nominated in the future by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock would enable such holders and lenders to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board.\nThe Company has registered, and has a duty to register, the resale of a large portion of our outstanding securities. The resale of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIn compliance with certain agreements to which the Company is a party, we have registered the resale of an aggregate of up to 44,490,032 shares of common stock that are either outstanding or issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock or convertible notes. The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the certain agreements to which the Company is subject, certain of the counterparties to such agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of our common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company\u2019s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe resale of a significant portion of the Company\u2019s securities or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company\u2019s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.\nHolders of the Convertible Securities and holders of large blocks of the Company\u2019s common stock collectively have a significant influence over matters presented to the Company\u2019s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of such securities collectively would be able to cause a significant change in the ownership of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company\u2019s securities held by them. If such a transaction, in combination with other transactions in securities of the Company which have already occurred or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an \u201cownership change\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company\u2019s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially. Certain accumulations or transfers of the Company\u2019s outstanding securities not involving these holders, could also cause such an \u201cownership change\u201d.
