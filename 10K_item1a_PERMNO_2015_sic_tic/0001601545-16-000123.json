If we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIn 2010, our board of directors approved a change in our strategic direction that has resulted in significant growth in assets and liabilities and contemplates continued growth. Specifically, we intend to continue to increase our residential, commercial business and commercial real estate loans using the lending origination and servicing platform we have built; add additional related lending groups operating in our market area and adjacent market areas; expand our branch network through select de novo and acquisition opportunities; and increase fee income, including through the opportunistic acquisition of fee income businesses that complement our current product capabilities while improving the revenue contribution of fee income from existing customers. We have added employees and incurred substantial additional expenses due to the implementation of our strategic plan, including salaries and operating expenses related to updated and de novo branches, a new senior management team, new lending officers and related support staff, new third-party managers for our investment portfolio, additional expenses related to operating as a public company, as well as significant investments to improve our online and mobile capabilities for consumer and business banking, and marketing costs relating to rebranding. Many of these increased expenses are considered fixed expenses. Unless we can successfully implement our strategic plan and continue to grow our interest-earning asset base, our financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected by these increased costs.\nThe successful continuation of our strategic plan will require, among other things, that we continue to leverage our operating costs through increased loan and deposit market share within our current markets and expand into new adjacent markets, continue to increase our core funding and decrease our reliance on acquisition based pricing, and increase our fee income through increased deposit services, cash management services and mortgage banking. Our ability to continue to grow successfully will depend on several other factors that may not be within our control, including continued favorable market conditions in the communities we serve, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area, and our ability to maintain high asset quality as we increase our commercial real estate loans and commercial business loan portfolios. While we believe we have the management resources, marketing platform and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, growth opportunities and lower cost deposit sources may not be available and we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy. Further, it will take time to fully implement our business strategy, especially for our lenders to originate enough loans and for our branches to attract enough favorably priced deposits to generate the net revenue needed to offset the associated expenses. Furthermore, we are a regulated entity and our regulators periodically review and oversee the pace and quality of our growth in assets and liabilities, offering of new products and services and geographic expansion. Regulatory authorities may encourage or require faster growing banks to slow the pace of growth and expansion if regulatory concerns develop.\nBecause we intend to continue to emphasize our commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations, our overall credit risk will increase, and downturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015, $802.4 million or 52.1% of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans (including commercial construction loans) and commercial business loans, compared to $8.6 million, or 4.2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. As our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nFurther, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate or construction loan, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios.\nOur loan portfolio contains a significant portion of loans that are unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur net loan portfolio has grown to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015, from $203.7 million at December 31, 2010. A portion of this increase is due to increases in commercial real estate and commercial business loans through our own originations and from purchases of and participations in loans originated by other financial institutions. It is difficult to assess the future performance of the loans recently added to our portfolio because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur performance depends on key personnel.\nOur performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior officers and the members of our board of directors. Our business model depends on the experience and expertise of our senior management team, directors and lending staff. Several of these individuals have been involved in the commercial banking business for much of their professional careers. Our performance will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management and banking personnel. There can be no assurances that our management team will be able to manage our operations or our expected growth or that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified personnel as needed in the future. The loss of any directors and/or officers could adversely affect us. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of our directors or officers.\nReduced residential mortgage activity in our market would slow our growth and negatively impact our net income.\nWe have experienced residential mortgage loan growth during each of the past five years and we have increased our residential mortgage loan infrastructure, including hiring lending officers and underwriting and support personnel and opening loan production offices. Our residential mortgage operations provide a material portion of our income and are significantly affected by market interest rates. Additionally, our mortgage lending activity is affected by refinance activity. A reduction in mortgage refinance activity and a rising or higher interest rate environment may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations, resulting in slower growth of our residential lending activity and, possibly, a decrease in the size of our residential loan portfolio. This could result in a decrease in interest income and a continued decrease in revenues from loan sales. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of non-interest expenses associated with our expanded residential lending platform, such as salaries and commissions, employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing and other operating costs. During periods of reduced residential mortgage loan demand, our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nWe have been and expect to be less profitable than our peers as we implement our business strategy.\nDuring the past five years we have incurred a substantial increase in operating expenses and personnel costs due primarily to our change in strategic direction to become a full service community banking organization and in order to build an expanded lending and deposit-taking platform. We have hired experienced executive officers and other staff which has significantly increased our employee base and personnel costs over the past five years. Additionally, in order to build our commercial real estate and commercial business lending experience and portfolios, we have in the past focused on high quality, variable-rate loans, as well as purchased loans and loan participations which has resulted in tight spreads and a lower overall yield on a portion of our loan portfolio compared to peer institutions that may have more fixed-rate, higher-margin loans. We also have relied upon soliciting higher cost deposits as a funding source which, in combination with a lower yielding loan portfolio, has resulted in our having a lower interest rate spread and margin compared to peer institutions. Accordingly, until we increase our interest earning assets through increased loan origination activity, improve on net interest rate margin and increase our overall scale, our net profits and level of operating efficiencies will continue to lag those of peer institutions. While our origination activity has increased noticeably over the past few years, until we improve on net interest rate margin and further increase our overall scale, our net profits and level of operating efficiencies will continue to lag those of peer institutions.\nApproximately 20% of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally have lower yields than loans, and we classify more than half of our investment securities as available for sale which creates potential volatility in our net income and equity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our investment securities portfolio, which includes US Treasury, Government Agency, mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, mutual funds and marketable equity securities totaled $431.8 million, or 20.4% of our total assets. Approximately 53.7% of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the size of the investment securities portfolio and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income. Investment securities typically have lower yields than loans. For fiscal 2015, the weighted average yield of our investment securities portfolio was 2.98% as compared to 3.52% for our loan portfolio. Accordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets had been invested in loans.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could adversely affect us.\nOur securities portfolio represents approximately 20% of our total assets, and over half of the securities in our portfolio are classified as available for sale. Accordingly, a decline in the fair value of our securities could cause a material decline in our reported equity and/or net income. At least quarterly, and more frequently when warranted by economic or market conditions, management evaluates all securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether or not the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary (\u201cOTTI\u201d). Marketable equity securities are evaluated for OTTI based on the severity and duration of the impairment and, if deemed to be other than temporary, the declines in fair value are reflected in earnings as realized losses. For impaired debt securities that are intended to be sold, or more likely than not will be required to be sold, the full amount of market decline is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Non-credit related OTTI for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. A decline in the market for the securities portfolio could result in impairment charges on some investment securities.\nOur branch network expansion strategy may negatively affect our financial performance.\nDepending on market conditions, we intend to expand our branch office network through selective de novo or acquired branch offices over the next several years. On January 18, 2014, we completed the acquisition of three branches in Nantucket, which we operate under the name Nantucket Bank, a division of Blue Hills Bank. We also opened a de novo branch office in Milton, Massachusetts in 2014, and a de novo branch office in University Station in Westwood, Massachusetts in 2015. In addition, we intend to open a de novo branch office in the Boston Seaport District in 2016. The cost to open the Westwood and Milton de novo branches was $2.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, including the costs of construction, equipment, furnishings and technology as well as marketing and promotional expenses associated with the grand opening of the branches. We will incur additional expenses in connection with the opening our new Seaport District branch. Our branch expansion strategy may not generate earnings, or may not generate earnings within a reasonable period of time. Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new or acquired branch, such as a suitable location, qualified personnel, and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to generate sufficient favorably priced deposits to produce enough income, including funding loan growth generated by our organization, to offset expenses related to the branch, some of which, like salaries and occupancy expense, are considered fixed costs.\nChanging interest rates may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur earnings and cash flows are dependent on our net interest income and income from our mortgage banking operations. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If interest rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits, particularly our higher cost savings and short-term time deposits and borrowed funds, more quickly than any changes in interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income. Furthermore, our mortgage banking income varies directly with movements in interest rates, and increases in interest rates could negatively affect our ability to originate loans in\nthe same volumes, and sell loans with attractive pricing, as we have in recent years. Increases in interest rates may also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nConversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.\nChanges in interest rates may also decrease fee income generated from our commercial lending operations. We enter into interest rate swap agreements with some of our commercial borrowers (and mirror swap agreements with a third party) that allow the borrower to pay a fixed interest rate on loans that are originated and carried in our loan portfolio as adjustable rate loans. We receive fee income from borrowers for providing this service. Under certain interest rate scenarios, borrowers may choose not to use this service, and our related fee income will decrease. GAAP also dictates that the Company must mark these contracts to fair value over the life of each swap. As interest rates change, positive and negative credit valuation marks on these contracts are also recorded in the income statement.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nWhile it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels over the past several years through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities, the Federal Reserve did raise the federal funds rate by a quarter point on December 17, 2015. As a general matter, our net interest income has been adversely impacted by the low rate environment that has existed over the past several years, however, at this point it is uncertain what impact the December rate increase might have on our net interest income (the difference between interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities). It is also uncertain when the Federal Reserve might raise or lower the federal funds rate in the future. If interest rates rise it may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. If rates remain low it could create deflationary pressures, which while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nA continuation or worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough some recent economic indicators have shown signs of improvement, economic growth has been slow. A decline in economic conditions could result in further uncertainty in the financial markets and slower improvement in general economic conditions. During the financial crisis, there were dramatic declines in the housing market, where falling real estate values and increasing foreclosures, unemployment, and under-employment negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. Our lending business is tied, in large part, to the housing market and real estate markets in general. A return to these conditions could result in more limited demand for the construction of new housing, and weakness in home pricing, and could ultimately result in increased delinquencies on our residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. Further, concerns over the financial markets and new regulations may cause lenders to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers. These conditions may also cause a further reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses, as well as adversely affect our liquidity and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us. Continued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the market for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Moreover, continued declines in the stock market in general, or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically, could adversely affect our stock performance.\nFinancial reform legislation is expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, many of which are not in final form. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations and policies has already resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and diverted management\u2019s time from other business activities, which adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules may adversely affect our returns on equity and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), set the leverage ratio at a uniform 4% of total assets, increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to certain exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule also required items related to accumulated other comprehensive income to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The rule limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015. The \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d will be phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer will be effective.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Blue Hills Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nFinancial reform legislation has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The legislation has also resulted in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the effect of new legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect our operations by restricting our business activities, including our ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These measures are likely to increase our costs of doing business and may have a significant adverse effect on our lending activities, financial\nperformance and operating flexibility. In addition, these risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect our financial performance.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve Board, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. If the Federal Reserve Board increases the federal funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nIn addition, there have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution\u2019s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. Were proposals such as these, or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor, to be implemented, we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. We recognize that our own relevant loss experience is limited as a result of our change in lending strategy over recent years. As such we evaluated the most recent eight years of national FDIC loss data for comparable sized savings institutions to determine the historic loss factors used in the allowance for loan losses calculation for all loan segments. Management believes this 8-year period is sufficient to span a full lending cycle. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. Furthermore, our strategic plan envisages significant growth in lending which will require additional provisions for loan losses and reduce our earnings in the short term.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConcentration of loans in our primary market area may increase risk.\nOur success depends primarily on general economic conditions in our market area in eastern Massachusetts. Most of our loans are to customers in this market. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in this market have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as our ability to originate new loans. As such, a weakness in real estate values in this market would also lower the value of the collateral securing loans on properties in our market. In addition, a weakening in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results.\nStrong competition for deposits and lending opportunities within our market areas, as well as competition from non-depository investment alternatives, may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and to be profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our ability to compete successfully in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or other non-depository investments, as providing superior expected returns, or if our customers seek to spread their deposits over several banks to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. Furthermore, technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. Additional increases in short-term interest rates could increase transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits. Efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. When bank customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits, or spread their accounts over several banks, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, thus increasing our funding costs and reducing our profitability.\nChanges in the programs offered by secondary market purchasers or our ability to qualify for their programs may reduce our mortgage banking revenues, which would negatively impact our non-interest income.\nWe generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and non-GSE investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecent regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell loans.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \"qualified mortgage\" definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule, a \"qualified mortgage\" loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \"bona fide discount points\" for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \"qualified mortgage,\" a borrower's total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While\nwe use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which may result in our restating our prior period financial statements.\nTechnological advances impact our business.\nThe banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs provided that they produce economies of scale and deploy technology in a safe and sound manner. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to a large enough number of customers to cover the up-front costs of implementation.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business including systems operated by third party vendors. For example, we rely extensively on our core processing vendor for our informational management systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, we cannot assure you that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately rectified. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, cause us to incur costs of rectification, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nGoodwill arises when a business is purchased for an amount greater than the fair market value of its net assets. We recognized goodwill as an asset on our balance sheet in connection with our acquisition of three branches in Nantucket in January 2014 that we operate under the name Nantucket Bank, a division of Blue Hills Bank. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill was necessary, then we would record the appropriate charge to earnings, which could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial position.", "PERMNO": 14792, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "BHBK"}
