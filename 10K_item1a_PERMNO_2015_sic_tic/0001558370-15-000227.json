{"cik": "1124140", "company": "EXACT SCIENCES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.\nWe may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses since we were formed and have had only modest revenues to date. From our date of inception on February 10, 1995 through December 31, 2014, we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately $420.8 million. We expect that our losses will continue for at least the next several years and that we will be required to invest significant additional funds toward commercialization of Cologuard and the development and commercialization of new products and services. If our revenue does not grow significantly, we will not be profitable. We cannot be certain that the revenue from the sale of any products or services based on our technologies will be sufficient to make us profitable.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan.\nAlthough we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, we may require additional capital to fully fund the commercialization of Cologuard and other business expansion activities, including the development of new products and services. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nOur success depends heavily on our Cologuard colorectal cancer screening test.\nFor the foreseeable future, our ability to generate revenues will depend entirely on the commercial success of Cologuard. The commercial success of Cologuard and our ability to generate revenues will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nacceptance in the medical community;\n\u00b7\npatient acceptance of and demand for the Cologuard test;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful sales, marketing and educational programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of patients tested for colorectal cancer as well as the number of patients who use Cologuard for that purpose;\n\u00b7\nsufficient coverage and reimbursement by third party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and nature of competition from other colorectal cancer or pre-cancer screening products and procedures;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining FDA marketing approval of Cologuard in the United States and the receipt and maintenance of marketing approval from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining and defending patent protection for the intellectual property relevant to Cologuard; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing, distribution, sales force and CLIA laboratory testing capabilities.\nIf we are unable to develop substantial sales of Cologuard or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business prospects would be adversely affected.\nOther companies or institutions may develop and market novel or improved methods for detecting colorectal cancer or pre-cancer, which may make our technologies less competitive or obsolete.\nThe market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of more than 80 million Americans age 50 and above. As a result, this market has attracted competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than we do. Some companies and institutions are developing serum-based tests and screening tests based on the detection of proteins, nucleic acids or the presence of fragments of mutated genes in the blood that are produced by colorectal or pre-cancer. We are aware of at least four companies-Epigenomics AG, Gene News, EDP Biotech Corporation and Quest Diagnostics-that are developing blood-based tests for the detection of colorectal cancer. Epigenomics AG completed a large multi-center study designed to demonstrate the performance of its blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer and submitted the results to the FDA in June 2014. It is our understanding that the FDA issued a response letter to Epigenomics AG requiring additional clinical studies to demonstrate the performance of its test and Epigenomics AG is in the process of conducting a study to satisfy the FDA\u2019s requirements. We also face competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy (a radiological imaging approach which visualizes the inside of the bowel by use of spiral computerized axial tomography known as a CT scan) as well as traditional screening tests such as FOBT and FIT and newer screening technologies such as the PillCam COLON approved by FDA in February 2014. Our competitors may also be working on additional methods of detecting colorectal and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced. We may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their tests are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources or stronger business relationships.\nIf third-party payors, including managed care organizations, do not approve reimbursement for Cologuard at adequate reimbursement rates, we may be unable to successfully commercialize Cologuard which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSuccessful commercialization of Cologuard depends, in large part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement from government insurance plans, managed care organizations and private insurance plans. Although we received a positive national coverage decision and what we believe is a commercially viable initial reimbursement rate from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) for Cologuard, it is also critical that other third party payors approve reimbursement for Cologuard at adequate reimbursement rates. Third-party payors may attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new healthcare products approved for marketing by the FDA. As a result, there is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of tests that incorporate new technology, such as Cologuard, will be eligible for coverage by third-party payors or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be. Reimbursement of Cologuard by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that it is: adequately sensitive for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer; not experimental or investigational; approved by the major guidelines organizations; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA), private payors are required to cover preventive services that receive a Grade A or Grade B from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Obtaining a Grade of A or B from USPSTF for Cologuard will be critical to successfully commercializing Cologuard. There can be no assurance that Cologuard will receive a Grade A or Grade B from the USPSTF, and its failure to do so would negatively impact our ability to secure private payor reimbursement. There also can be no assurance regarding whether the ACA\u2019s mandated coverage for preventive services will remain in effect, or in effect in its current form, if and when Cologuard receives a Grade A or Grade B from the USPSTF, whether private payors will agree to pay our stated price for Cologuard, or whether private payers will impose material co-payments or deductibles on their insureds for Cologuard even if coverage of Cologuard is mandated under the ACA.\nInclusion of Cologuard as a qualified screening test in performance measurement tools such as the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) will also be critical for commercial adoption by private payors. Even if Cologuard receives an A or B Grade from the USPSTF, there is no guarantee that it will be included in HEDIS measures or other similar performance measurement tools and failure to do so would negatively impact our ability to secure third party reimbursement.\nIf we are unable to obtain positive coverage decisions from third-party payors, including managed care organizations, approving reimbursement for Cologuard at adequate levels, its commercial success would be compromised and our revenues would be significantly limited. We may also experience material delays in obtaining such reimbursement decisions and payment for Cologuard which are beyond our control. Moreover, coverage determinations and reimbursement rates are subject to change, and we cannot guarantee that even if we initially achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement rates they will be applicable to Cologuard in the future.\nIf our clinical studies do not satisfy providers, payors, patients and others as to the reliability, effectiveness and superiority of Cologuard, we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order, and third-party payors to pay for, this product.\nAlthough we have received FDA approval for Cologuard, if the results of our research and clinical studies and our sales and marketing activities relating to communication of these results, do not convince thought-leading gastroenterologists, guidelines organizations, primary care physicians and other healthcare providers, third-party payors and patients that Cologuard is reliable, effective and superior to existing screening methods, including Hemoccult II, Hemoccult Sensa and immunochemical FOBT, we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order, and third-party payors to pay for, Cologuard, which could prevent us from successfully commercializing it.\nWe have limited selling and marketing resources and lack sales, marketing, customer support, manufacturing, distribution and commercial laboratory experience, which may restrict our success in commercializing products.\nTo grow our business as planned, we must expand our sales, marketing and customer support capabilities, which will involve developing and administering our commercial infrastructure and/or collaborative commercial arrangements and partnerships. We must also maintain satisfactory arrangements for the manufacture and distribution of Cologuard. In addition, as part of our commercialization strategy, we have recently established a CLIA certified lab facility to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. We have limited experience managing a sales force, customer support operation and operating a manufacturing operation and clinical lab facility and we may encounter difficulties\nretaining and managing the specialized workforce these activities require. We may seek to partner with others to assist us with any or all of these functions. However, we may be unable to find appropriate third parties with whom to enter into these arrangements. Furthermore, if we do enter into these arrangements, these third parties may not perform as expected.\nIf we are unable to deploy and maintain effective sales and marketing capabilities, we will have difficulty achieving market awareness and selling our products and services.\nTo achieve commercial success for Cologuard and our future products and services, we must continue to develop and grow our sales and marketing organization. We currently have a 140 person sales team, including approximately 100 in a direct field sales force. Our direct sales force calls directly on healthcare providers throughout the United States to initiate sales of Cologuard. Our sales organization must explain to healthcare providers the reliability, effectiveness and benefits of Cologuard as compared to existing screening methods such as FOBT and FIT. We may not be able to successfully manage our dispersed sales force. We have also entered into marketing arrangements with independent sales organizations, but we cannot be assured that they will be effective. Because of the competition for their services, we may be unable to partner with or retain additional qualified sales representatives, either as our employees or independent contractors or through independent sales organizations. Further, we may not be able to enter into agreements with sales representatives on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nEstablishing and maintaining sales and marketing capabilities will be expensive and time-consuming. Our expenses associated with maintaining our sales force may be disproportional compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of the Cologuard test.\nThe success of Cologuard depends on the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nCologuard may not gain market acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of Cologuard will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 its demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting colorectal pre-cancer and cancer;\n\u00b7 its price;\n\u00b7 the availability of alternative screening methods;\n\u00b7 the willingness of physicians to prescribe Cologuard; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nEven if Cologuard is superior to other colorectal cancer screening options, adequate third-party reimbursement is obtained and medical practitioners choose to order Cologuard, only a small number of people may decide to be screened for colorectal cancer. Despite the availability of current colorectal cancer screening methods as well as the recommendations of the ACS that all Americans age 50 and above be screened for colorectal cancer, approximately 47 percent of these individuals are not screened according to current guidelines. Use of a stool-based DNA colorectal cancer screening test will require people to collect a stool sample, which some people may be reluctant to do. If Cologuard does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate material revenues and we may not become profitable.\nWe may not be able to successfully establish and maintain collaborative and licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products and services.\nThe development and commercialization of our products and services relies, directly or indirectly, upon strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. We currently have a collaborative and licensing arrangement with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research. In addition, we have licensing agreements with Hologic and MDx Health. Such arrangements provide us with intellectual property crucial to our product development, including\ntechnology that we have incorporated into Cologuard. Our dependence on licensing, collaboration and other similar agreements with third parties may subject us to a number of risks. There can be no assurance that any current contractual arrangements between us and third parties or between our strategic partners and other third parties will be continued, not breached or not terminated early or that we will be able to enter into the future relationships necessary to successfully commercialize Cologuard or any other product or service we may develop. Any failure to obtain or retain the rights to necessary technologies could require us to re-configure our products and services, which could negatively impact their commercial sale or increase the associated costs, either of which could materially harm our business and adversely affect our future revenues.\nAs we seek to commercialize and market Cologuard and develop new products and services, we expect to continue and expand our reliance on collaborative and licensing arrangements. Establishing new strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements is difficult and time-consuming. Discussions with potential collaborators or licensors may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent we agree to work exclusively with one collaborator in a given area, our opportunities to collaborate with other entities could be limited. Potential collaborators or licensors may reject collaborations with us based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful commercialization of Cologuard or any other product or service.\nEven though Cologuard has received regulatory clearance in the United States, if we do not receive regulatory clearance for Cologuard in other jurisdictions, our prospects may be materially and negatively affected.\nGovernments in countries outside the United States also regulate diagnostic tests marketed in such countries, and obtaining their approvals can be lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain. The approval process varies from country to country and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes prior to marketing Cologuard. We may not receive regulatory approval for Cologuard in countries other than the United States on a timely basis, if ever. Even if approval is granted in any such country, the approval may require limitations on the uses or availability of Cologuard. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for Cologuard in territories outside the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nWe face uncertainty related to health care reform, pricing, coverage and reimbursement, which could reduce our revenue.\nRecent health care reform laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are significantly affecting the U.S. healthcare and medical services industry. Existing legislation, and possible future legal and regulatory changes, could substantially change the structure and finances of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices, including our current and future products and services. Any change in reimbursement policy could result in a change in patient co-payments, which could adversely affect patient willingness and ability to use Cologuard and any other product or service we may develop. Healthcare reforms, which may intend to reduce health care costs, may have the effect of discouraging third-party payors from covering certain kinds of medical products and services, particularly newly developed technologies, such as Cologuard.\nEven without further legislative reform, there can be no assurance that CMS will maintain its current reimbursement rate for Cologuard. If the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard is reduced, our revenues could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that CMS and third party payors who initially decide to cover Cologuard will continue to cover Cologuard.\nIf we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or similar state laws, that failure could adversely affect any future payor consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. Federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) requirements and laws of certain states impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators, and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory\nto implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future payor consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe currently perform Cologuard predominantly in one laboratory facility. If this or any future facility or our equipment were damaged or destroyed, or if we experience a significant disruption in our operations for any reason, our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently perform Cologuard predominantly in a single laboratory facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are also located in Madison, Wisconsin. If these, or any future facilities, were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to fire, floods, storms, tornadoes, other inclement weather events or natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages, or otherwise, our business could be severely disrupted. If our Madison, Wisconsin, laboratory is disrupted, we may not be able to perform Cologuard or generate test reports as promptly as patients and healthcare providers require or expect, or possibly not at all. If we are unable to perform Cologuard or generate test reports within a timeframe that meets patient and healthcare provider expectations, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially harmed.\nWe currently maintain insurance against damage to our property and equipment [and against business interruption and research and development restoration expenses], subject to deductibles and other limitations. If we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect to an interruption, or if an interruption is not subject to coverage under our insurance policies, we may not be able to cover our losses.\nFailure in our information technology, storage systems or our clinical laboratory equipment could significantly disrupt our operations and our research and development efforts, which could adversely impact our revenues, as well as our research, development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology, or IT, systems, which support our operations, including at our clinical laboratory, and our research and development efforts. We are substantially dependent on our IT systems to receive and process Cologuard test orders, securely store patient health records and deliver the results of Cologuards. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, and in particular to operate our clinical laboratory, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Any interruption in the operation of IT systems, could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on courier delivery services to transport Cologuard collection kits to patients and samples back to our laboratory facility for analysis. If these delivery services are disrupted, customer satisfaction and our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe ship Cologuard collection kits to patients, and patients ship samples to our Madison, Wisconsin, laboratory facility for analysis, by air and ground express courier delivery service. Disruptions in delivery service, whether due to bad weather, natural disaster, terrorist acts or threats, or for other reasons, can adversely affect customer satisfaction, specimen quality and our ability to provide our services on a timely basis.\nWe may be subject to substantial costs and liability, or be prevented from using technologies incorporated in Cologuard, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent or other intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors, our licensees, our suppliers, our strategic partners or us. We pursue a patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the non-invasive early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer and is designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties in the United States and, potentially, in certain foreign countries. We have filed patent applications that we believe cover the methods we have designed and use in Cologuard to detect colorectal cancer and\npre-cancer. In order to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate actions against third parties. Any actions regarding patents could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business. Additionally, such actions could result in challenges to the validity or applicability of our patents. Because the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent application publishes or the patent is issued, we have no way of knowing if others may have filed patent applications covering technologies used by us or our partners. Additionally, there may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our technologies that may block or compete with our technologies. From time to time we have received correspondence from third parties alleging to hold intellectual property rights that could block our commercialization of products. While none of these inquiries to date have had any material effect on us, and while we do not believe that any pending correspondence would have such an effect, we may receive inquiries in the future that could have a material effect on our business. Even if third-party claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we would prevail in any such suits or that the damages or other remedies, if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require that we, or our strategic partners, enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may only be available on unacceptable terms, if at all. These claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and commercial sale of services or products containing our technologies, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, patents and patent applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost to us as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved. An adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss of rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property, which would impair any competitive advantage we may otherwise have.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. Additionally, the U.S. Congress recently passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in September 2011. The America Invents Act reforms United States patent law in part by changing the standard for patent approval from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d standard to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d standard and developing a post-grant review system. This new legislation changes United States patent law in a way that may weaken our ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for future inventions in the United States.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for any such patents to be issued. Further, we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, the subject of opposition proceedings relating to our patents. We cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in co-ownership of such patents with the third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents. Furthermore, in the life sciences field, courts frequently render opinions that may affect the patentability of certain inventions or discoveries, including opinions that may affect the patentability of isolated DNA and/or methods for analyzing or comparing DNA. Such decisions may adversely impact our ability to obtain new patents and facilitate third-party challenges to our existing patents.\nIf we or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we may be subject to stringent penalties and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nThe marketing and sale of Cologuard is subject to various state, federal and foreign regulations. We cannot assure you that we or our strategic partners will be able to comply with applicable regulations and regulatory guidelines. If we or our partners, including independent sales representatives, fail to comply with any such applicable regulations and\nguidelines, we could incur significant liability and/or our partners could be forced to cease offering our products and services in certain jurisdictions.\nHealthcare policy has been a subject of extensive discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments and healthcare laws and regulations are subject to change. Development of the existing commercialization strategy for Cologuard has been based on existing healthcare policies. We cannot predict what additional changes, if any, will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to various complex laws and regulations. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations.\nAs a provider of clinical diagnostic products and services, we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. In particular, the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental certification and licensing regulations, as well as federal and state laws regarding:\n\u00b7 test ordering and billing practices;\n\u00b7 marketing, sales and pricing practices;\n\u00b7 health information privacy and security, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and comparable state laws;\n\u00b7 insurance;\n\u00b7 anti-markup legislation; and\n\u00b7 consumer protection.\nWe are also required to comply with FDA regulation, including with respect to our labeling and promotion activities. In addition, advertising of our tests is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. Violation of any FDA requirement could result in enforcement actions, such as seizures, injunctions, civil penalties and criminal prosecutions, and violation of any FTC requirement could result in injunctions and other associated remedies, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most states also have similar regulatory and enforcement authority for devices. Additionally, most foreign countries have authorities comparable to the FDA and processes for obtaining marketing approvals. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals, and complying with all laws and regulations, may subject us to similar risks and delays as those we could experience under FDA and FTC regulation. We incur various costs in complying and overseeing compliance with these laws and regulations.\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could incur significant fines and penalties and our reputation and prospects could suffer.\nSome of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting \u2018kickbacks\u2019 and false or fraudulent claims.\nIn addition to FDA marketing restrictions, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the healthcare product and service industry and to regulate billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers. These laws include a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional\nactivities of manufacturers of medical devices and providers of laboratory services by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers or prescribers of medical devices and laboratory services. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing and billing practices is constantly evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects. Our failure to comply with applicable laws could result in various adverse consequences which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, including the exclusion of our products and services from government programs and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.\nThe success of our business is substantially dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team including Kevin Conroy, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Maneesh Arora, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott Coward, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, William Megan, our Senior Vice President, Finance, and Dr. Graham Lidgard, our Senior Vice President and Chief Science Officer. These executives are critical to directing and managing our growth and development in the future. Our success is substantially dependent upon our senior management\u2019s ability to lead our company, implement successful corporate strategies and initiatives, develop key relationships, including relationships with collaborators and business partners, and successfully commercialize products and services in the United States and abroad. While our management team has significant experience in securing FDA approvals for diagnostic products, we have considerably less experience in commercializing a product or service. The efforts of our management team will be critical to us as we develop our technologies and seek to commercialize Cologuard and other FDA approved products and services.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our managerial personnel and to attract additional personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain managerial personnel. If we were to lose any of our senior management team, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies. Competition for desirable personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary staff. The failure to maintain management or to attract sales personnel as we commercialize Cologuard could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and increases in our insurance rates.\nThe sale and use of Cologuard could lead to product or professional liability claims based on allegations that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect or our laboratory was negligent in processing test results, which resulted in the failure to detect the disease for which it was designed or an unnecessary procedure which caused harm. A product or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend, either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition. We cannot assure you that our liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a liability claim. Any claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct any future studies of our technologies that may be required by the FDA or foreign regulatory bodies, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical or other studies that will be required to obtain FDA approval for future products we may develop or the approval of foreign regulatory bodies that may be required for such future products as well as Cologuard. Accordingly, we expect to rely on third parties such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct any such studies. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities. These third-party contractors may\nnot complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of our requirement to prepare, and ensure our compliance with, various procedures required under good clinical practices, even though third-party contract research organizations may prepare and comply with their own, comparable procedures. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain a required regulatory approval.\nDelaware law, our charter documents and rights agreement could impede or discourage a takeover or change of control that stockholders may consider favorable.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Accordingly, our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of our company. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7 Our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.\n\u00b7 Only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board.\n\u00b7 Our stockholders may not act by written consent.\n\u00b7 There are various limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice requirements for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\n\u00b7 Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock.\nThese types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition, in February 2011, we adopted a rights agreement that provides that in the event of (i) an acquisition of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock or (ii) an announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, our stockholders, other than the potential acquiror, shall be granted rights enabling them to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a substantial discount to the then prevailing market price. The rights agreement could significantly dilute such acquiror\u2019s ownership position in our shares, thereby making a takeover prohibitively expensive and encouraging such acquiror to negotiate with our board of directors. Therefore, the rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors.\nOur inability to manage growth could harm our business.\nAs we launch the commercialization of Cologuard, we expect to require additional personnel in the areas of sales and marketing, laboratory operations, billing and collections, quality assurance and compliance. As a result, our operating expenses and capital requirements may increase significantly. Our ability to manage our growth effectively requires us to forecast expenses accurately and to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. As we move forward in commercializing Cologuard, we will also need to effectively manage our manufacturing, laboratory operations and sales and marketing needs, which represent new areas of oversight for us. If we are unable to manage our anticipated growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur growing international operations could subject us to risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business and results of operations.\nWe expect to increase the availability of Cologuard in non-U.S. markets and to expand our operations in foreign countries. Our international expansion exposes us to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which we operate in the U.S. as well as U.S. rules and regulations that govern foreign activities such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, we may be adversely affected by other risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.\nRisks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u00b7 numerous and varied non-U.S. regulatory requirements, including with respect to health care, that are subject to change and that could limit our ability to offer or market Cologuard or other products and services we may develop on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 numerous and varied U.S. regulatory requirements, including import- and export-related laws and regulations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7 changes by foreign governments and other foreign healthcare payors in reimbursement rates for Cologuard or other products and services we may develop;\n\u00b7 differing local preferences and expectations for healthcare services;\n\u00b7 differing private and public health insurance systems, including differing approaches to coverage determinations and reimbursement amounts;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;\n\u00b7 potential changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;\n\u00b7 political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u00b7 difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations\n\u00b7 differing labor regulations;\n\u00b7 potential changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7 minimal protection of intellectual and other property rights in certain jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 varying enforcement of contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u00b7 restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, as well as the potential nationalization or seizure of business enterprises or assets.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and reduce our financial resources.\nIn the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products, services or technologies. Because we have not made any acquisitions to date, our ability to do so successfully is unproven. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by investors, healthcare providers, patients and others. We may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by any indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Further, sharp drops in the market price of our common stock may expose us to securities class-action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management\u2019s attention and corporate resources, which would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because we are a company with no significant operating revenue, any of the risk factors listed in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d may be deemed material and may affect our stock price.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 88863, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "EXAS"}
