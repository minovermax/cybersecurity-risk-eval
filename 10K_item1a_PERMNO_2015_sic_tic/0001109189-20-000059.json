{"cik": "1109189", "company": "BASIC ENERGY SERVICES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business depends on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and this spending and our business has been in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. Customers\u2019 expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas, as well as the availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, may cause them to curtail spending, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries and merger, acquisition and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers. Activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas may adversely affect the ability of certain of our customers to conduct operations. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, environmental and other governmental regulations regarding the exploration for and production and development of oil and natural gas reserves, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers. This reduction may cause a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of our services. In addition, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent existing production is not replaced and the number of producing wells for us to service declines.\nOil and gas industry pricing remained relatively stable through the middle of 2014. From the second half of 2014 through 2016, oil and natural gas prices declined significantly, due in large part to increasing supplies and weakening demand growth. Although oil prices increased from 2017 into 2018, they have since declined towards the end of 2018 and remained low throughout 2019. Natural gas prices have been depressed for a prolonged period and utilization and pricing for our services in our natural gas-based operating areas have remained challenged. As a result, demand for our products and services and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services have declined. Oil and gas prices may remain depressed for the foreseeable future.\nLimitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause oil and natural gas producers to make further reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and our utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their suppliers, including us. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related general production spending and level of drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our well service equipment. If oil or natural gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a reduction in drilling activities, the demand for our services and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. The Cushing WTI Spot Oil Price averaged $64.94 and $56.98 per barrel (\"bbl\") in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Cushing WTI oil prices have declined from over $107 per bbl in June 2014 to $61.14 per bbl on December 31, 2019. The Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price averaged $3.17 and $2.57 per Mcf for 2018 and 2019, respectively.\nOn March 9, 2020, as a result of multiple significant factors impacting supply and demand in the global oil and natural gas markets, including the announced price reductions and possible production increases by members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate oil declined sharply and may continue to decline. Oil and natural gas commodity prices are expected to continue to be volatile. We cannot predict the duration or effects of this sudden decrease, but if the prices of oil and natural gas continues to decline or remain depressed for a lengthy period, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition within the well services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe well services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that have longer operating histories, possess substantially greater financial, technological and other resources and have greater name recognition in certain operating areas than we do. With decreased demand for well services, multiple sources of comparable well services are available from a number of different competitors. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand, which could result in active price competition. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. In addition, adverse market conditions lower demand for well servicing equipment, which results in excess equipment and lower utilization rates. If adverse oil and natural gas market conditions persist or deteriorate further, our utilization rates may decline.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which would in turn reduce the demand for our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation, and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nWe may require additional capital in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe anticipate we will need to make substantial capital investments in the future to purchase additional equipment to expand our services, refurbish our well servicing rigs and replace existing equipment including idled equipment brought back into service as activity levels improved. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested approximately $68.7 million in cash for capital expenditures and $20.2 million of capital leases. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $55.4 million in cash for capital expenditures and $7.9 million of capital leases. For 2020, we have currently budgeted $42.6 million for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, including $14.2 million for capital leases. Historically, we have financed these investments through internally generated funds, debt and equity offerings, our capital lease program and borrowings under our credit facilities. Please read Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information.\nOur significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs. However, if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments, our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital to fund our proposed capital expenditures and acquisitions, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Adverse changes in the capital markets could make it difficult to obtain additional capital or obtain it at attractive rates or at all. If we are unable to maintain or obtain access to capital, we could experience a reduction of liquidity and may result in difficulty funding our operations, repayment of short-term borrowings, payments of interest and other obligations.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges in the past. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, and intangible assets. If any indication of impairment for our long lived assets exists, we project future cash flows on an undiscounted basis for other long-lived assets, and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our long-lived assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. If we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results are materially different from what we have predicted, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur well servicing and other completion service-related equipment requires significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain competitiveness. Our equipment typically does not generate revenue while undergoing maintenance, upgrades or refurbishments. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Furthermore, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service, or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, increased demand, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our well servicing equipment and other completion service-related equipment and the increase in cost to maintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe have operated at a loss in the past, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nHistorically, we have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may not be able to reduce our costs, increase our revenues, or reduce our debt service obligations sufficient to achieve or maintain profitability and generate positive operating income. Under such circumstances, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total outstanding debt of $327.1 million, net of discount and deferred financing costs, including $300 million of aggregate principal amount due under the Senior Notes, capital lease obligations in the aggregate amount of $35.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, Basic had $34.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, giving Basic $35.7 million of available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we made cash interest payments totaling $39.8 million and $35.1 million, respectively. In addition, on March 9, 2020, the Company issued a Senior Secured Promissory Note in favor of Ascribe in an aggregate principal amount equal to $15 million.\nOur current and future indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022impair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general as a substantial portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in industry and market conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to operate or expand our business;\n\u2022limit management's flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business or industry;\n\u2022put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent that we incur variable rate indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in instruments governing any existing or future indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of such instruments. In the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest, secured lenders could foreclose on any of our assets securing their loans and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our indebtedness is accelerated, or we enter into bankruptcy, we may be unable to pay all of our indebtedness in full. Any of the foregoing consequences could restrict our ability to grow our business and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take actions in order to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable. As a result, our indebtedness and liabilities could expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and restrict or impair our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $327.1 million of indebtedness, net of discount and deferred financing costs, including $300 million of aggregate principal amount due under the Senior Notes, and capital lease obligations in the aggregate amount of $35.9 million under the ABL Facility. On March 9, 2020, the Company issued a Senior Secured Promissory Note in favor of Ascribe in an aggregate principal amount equal to $15 million. Based on our Senior Note obligations, we expect to incur interest payments of approximately $16.1 million due April 2020. If we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing, delaying or eliminating capital investments;\n\u2022seeking to raise additional capital, which may or may not be available to us on onerous terms or at all or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders; or\n\u2022financing or restructuring our remaining debt.\nHowever, we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations and capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Lower commodity prices and in turn lower demand for our products and services have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas prices could have a further adverse effect on our liquidity position. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business and operations. If we continue to experience operating losses and we are not able to generate additional liquidity, including through our proposed strategic divestitures and other business\noperations, then our liquidity needs may exceed availability under our ABL Facility and other facilities that we may enter into in the future, and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. If we are unable to secure such additional funds, we may not be able to meet our future obligations as they become due. If, for any reason, we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable, which could in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements. In addition, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings, or they could prevent us from making payments on the Senior Notes. If amounts outstanding under our ABL Facility or the Senior Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot be certain that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes impose limitations on our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers, sales or transfers of assets without the lenders\u2019 consent; and\n\u2022limitations on dividends and distributions.\nIn addition, our ABL Credit Agreement, our indenture and our current and future indebtedness may require us to maintain certain financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial conditions, some of which become more restrictive over time and may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them. The failure to comply with any of these financial conditions, including the financial ratios or covenants, would cause a default under our ABL Credit Agreement, our indenture or future indebtedness. A default under any of our indebtedness, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness or other indebtedness, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. In addition, a default or acceleration of any of our indebtedness under any of our indebtedness could result in a default under or acceleration of other indebtedness with cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. In the event of any acceleration of our indebtedness, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and any holders of secured indebtedness may seek to foreclose on the assets securing such indebtedness. Even if new financing is available, it may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our ABL Credit Agreement, our indenture or future indebtedness or existing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including in connection with acquisitions. Please read Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility\u201d for a discussion of our ABL Credit Agreement.\nA further downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was rated \u201cCaa1\u201d with a stable outlook by Moody\u2019s Investors Service (\"Moody's\"). On January 31, 2020, our long-term debt was lowered to \u201cCCC+\u201d with a negative outlook by S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\"). Following the C&J Transaction, on March 10, 2020, Moody's and S&P affirmed these ratings. As of the time of filing this Form 10-K, no additional changes in our credit rating have occurred; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be further downgraded. Any further downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets.\nWhile we expect to continue to have access to credit markets, our non-investment grade status may limit our ability to refinance our existing debt, could cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable and more restrictive terms and conditions, and could increase certain fees and interest of our borrowings. This could make it significantly more costly for us to borrow money, to issue debt securities, to enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. Our inability to access the capital markets may increase the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which could decrease our ability to repay debt balances, negatively affect our cash flow and impact our access to the inventory and services needed to operate our business. Negative credit rating actions and the reasons for such actions could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of, and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on, our debt securities.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a Change of Control as defined therein.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement are followed by a downgrade in our rating by either S&P or Moody\u2019s within 90 days, a \u201cChange of Control\u201d as defined in our Senior Notes will be deemed to have occurred. If the Company experiences such a Change of Control, the Company will be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. We may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes and may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to repurchase the Senior Notes as required under the Indenture will constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) resulting in acceleration of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Notes.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our ABL Facility bear interest at variable rates, exposing us to interest rate risk. If the interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our results of operations and cash flows for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, including operational hazards and cyber-attacks. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, craters, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022personal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and\n\u2022suspension of operations.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nAs is customary in our industry, our service contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. In addition, our indemnification rights may not fully protect us if the customer is insolvent or becomes bankrupt, does not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise does not possess sufficient resources to indemnify us. In addition, our indemnification rights may be held unenforceable in some jurisdictions. For instance, certain states, including Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Our inability to fully realize the benefits of our contractual indemnification protections could result in significant liabilities and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against many of these hazards. However, we do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, including cybersecurity risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. As such, not all of our property is insured. We are also self-insured up to retention limits with regard to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and medical and dental coverage. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party data and historical claims history. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against, or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is likely that, in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive than it has been in the recent past. In addition,\nour insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and maintaining technology development and enhancements. New technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. Our competitors may develop or acquire the right to use new technologies not available to us, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater resources that may allow them to implement new technologies before we can. Our inability to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis and at competitive cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or compliance.\nOur operations are subject to federal, regional, state, local and tribal laws and regulations relating to protection of natural resources and the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations and waste management, including the storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital or other substantial expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our facilities, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection and public health and safety. Regulations concerning equipment certification also create an ongoing need for regular maintenance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in investigations, restrictions or orders suspending well or other service operations, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the revocation of permits and the issuance of corrective action orders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and oilfield and industrial wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Our water logistics segment includes disposal operations into injection wells that pose risks of seismic activity and environmental liability, including leakage from the wells to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was without fault or lawful at the time it occurred or as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Clean-up costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with past operations or changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies and other regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety and hazardous materials manifesting, labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, requirements for recording devices or electronic logging devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. The modification or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas and production of oil and natural gas and could limit well servicing opportunities. We may not be able to recover some or any of our costs of compliance with these laws and regulations from insurance.\nPlease read Items 1 and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties - Environmental Regulation and Climate Change\u201d for more information on the environmental laws and government regulations that are applicable to us.\nWe may not be able to grow successfully through future acquisitions or successfully manage future growth, and we may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses we do acquire.\nOur business strategy includes growth through the acquisitions of other businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention. Even if we are successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital. Furthermore, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions. We may also be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with or to fund future acquisitions under our credit agreements.\nWhether we realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition, including the recent C&J Transaction, depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the business of CJWS in the expected timeframe. This could adversely affect our future results. If our intended expansion of our business is not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and we may not achieve the increases in revenue and profitability that we hope to realize.\nFollowing the C&J Transaction, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from purchasing the business of CJWS.\nAn inability to manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the C&J Transaction.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022greater than expected strain on the Company\u2019s cash position;\n\u2022appropriately managing our liabilities;\n\u2022potential unknown operational difficulties, such as inability to retain C&J personnel or customers;\n\u2022performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by focusing on the integration of operations following the C&J Transaction.\nA key element of our business strategy involves the expansion of the services we will provide to our customer base. This aspect of our business strategy is subject to numerous uncertainties, including:\n\u2022our ability to retain or hire experienced crews and other personnel;\n\u2022the amount of customer demand for the services we intend to provide;\n\u2022our ability to secure necessary equipment, materials or technology to successfully execute our expansion objective; and\n\u2022any shortages of water used in our hydraulic fracturing operations;\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in implementing our planned expansion of the services we offer could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete, business, financial condition and results of operations, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize.\nFollowing the completion of the Exchange Transaction, Ascribe has voting control over the Company.\nUpon completion of the Exchange Transaction, Ascribe will collectively beneficially controls a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. Additionally, in connection with the Exchange Agreement, the Company and Ascribe entered into a Stockholders Agreement. As contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement, simultaneously with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, the board of directors was reconstituted from six directors to seven directors, comprised of (i) three Class I Directors, (ii) two Class II Directors, and (iii) two Class III Directors. Additionally, effective as of the closing of the C&J Transaction, each of Messrs. Timothy H. Day and Samuel E. Langford resigned from the Board and (a) Lawrence First was appointed as a Class I Director, (b) Derek Jeong was appointed as a Class II Director and (c)\nRoss Solomon was appointed as a Class III Director. Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, following the closing of the C&J Transaction and until the Board Rights Termination Date, Ascribe is entitled to designate for nomination for election to the board of directors all members of the board of directors, provided that such designations must be made in a manner to ensure that at all times the board of directors is comprised of at least two independent directors. In addition, the Stockholders Agreement provides that certain actions of the Company and its subsidiaries require approval of a special committee of the board of directors comprised solely of at least two independent directors.\nAs a result, Ascribe may control all matters that require stockholder approval, as well as its management and affairs. For example, Ascribe may unilaterally approve the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way the Company is managed or the direction of its business. The interests of Ascribe with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting the Company, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire the Company, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, this concentration of ownership control may:\n\u2022 delay, defer or prevent a change in control;\n\u2022 entrench its management and the board of directors; or\n\u2022 impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving the Company that other stockholders may desire.\nAscribe\u2019s concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant stockholders.\nWe may not be able to execute previously-announced dispositions or may incur a loss on such dispositions.\nOn December 10, 2019, our board of directors approved a plan to divest our pressure pumping assets, not inclusive of coiled tubing, in one or more transactions. While the divestiture is designed to strengthen our remaining production businesses of well servicing and water logistics, we may not be able to successfully negotiate definitive agreements and consummate the contemplated dispositions on terms favorable to us, or may incur a loss on such dispositions. Additionally, the contemplated dispositions or the announcement of the plan of disposition may disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on several significant customers, and a loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers consist primarily of major and independent oil and gas companies. During each of 2019 and 2018, our top five customers accounted for 26% and 24% of our revenues, respectively. One individual customer comprised 12% of our revenues in 2019. The loss of any one of our largest customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nIn most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. In addition, customers who are more highly leveraged or otherwise unable to pay their creditors in the ordinary course of business may become insolvent or be unable to operate as a going concern. We may be unable to collect amounts due or damages we are awarded from these customers, and our efforts to collect such amounts may damage our customer relationships. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of employee turnover. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to find enough skilled labor to meet our needs, which could limit our growth. Our business activity historically decreases or increases with the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, we compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the requisite technical skills and experience. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such\nmatters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, which can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. We may have problems finding enough skilled and unskilled laborers in the future if the demand for our services increases. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. If we are not able to increase our service rates sufficiently to compensate for wage rate increases, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOther factors may also inhibit our ability to find enough workers to meet our employment needs. Our services require skilled workers who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of our industry volatility and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. We believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel. Our inability to employ or retain skilled technical personnel generally could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur success depends on key members of our management, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of some of our executive officers. These individuals possess extensive expertise, talent and leadership. The loss of the services of our key personnel could disrupt our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers that contain, among other provisions, non-compete agreements, we may not be able to enforce the non-compete provisions in the employment agreements.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. These information systems are increasingly subject to sophisticated cybersecurity threats such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), computer viruses, or other malicious code, phishing and cyber-attacks, and other similar events. These threats arise from numerous sources, not all of which are within our control, including fraud or malice on the part of third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient in preventing all such incidents or attacks, or avoiding a material impact to our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. A cyber incident or attack could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, temporary disruptions of service, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or exposure to litigation, damage to equipment (which could cause environmental or safety issues) and other financial costs and losses. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyber-attacks. A cyber-related attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nAdverse weather conditions may affect our operations.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. Some of these areas are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. Extended drought conditions in our operating regions could impact our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water. Severe weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, droughts, flooding, extreme temperatures and hurricanes may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension of operations, and loss of or damage to equipment and facilities. Damage from any adverse weather conditions could delay our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions may also affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Please read the risk factor above, \u201cIf oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\u201d\nThe rapid spread of a contagious illness, including the recent spread of the COVID-19 or novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event, may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. As the coronavirus outbreak is still evolving, much of its international and domestic impact remains unknown. If our customers, commodity markets or the U.S. or global economy is negatively impacted, we may experience a lower demand for our services. In addition, our reliance on third-party supplier, contractors, and service providers exposes us to possibility of delay or interruption of our operations. It is impossible to predict the effect of the continued spread, or fear of continued spread, of the coronavirus globally. Should the coronavirus continue to spread globally or within the U.S., our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting or regulating emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our field services.\nIn response to studies finding that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) from industrial and energy sources contribute to increases of carbon dioxide levels in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans and contribute to global warming and other environmental effects, Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has adopted various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act addressing emissions of GHGs that may affect the oil and gas industry. In 2012 the EPA published a final rule, known as New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) Subpart OOOO, that include standards to reduce volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) emissions associated with oil and natural gas production. In June 2016, the EPA also published a final rule, known as NSPS Subpart OOOOa, to reduce methane and additional VOC emissions from oil and natural gas facilities that were constructed, reconstructed or modified after September 18, 2015. The rules and the EPA\u2019s subsequent actions to reconsider and propose stays of the rules have been heavily litigated, and in October 2018, the EPA released proposed revisions to some of the 2016 requirements, including reducing the required frequency of fugitive emissions monitoring at wellsites and compressor stations. As recently as August 2019, the EPA has proposed modifications to the NSPS Subparts OOOO and OOOOa rules-for example, proposing to remove sources in the transmission and storage segment of the oil and natural gas industry from regulation under NSPS Subparts OOOO and OOOOa and to rescind methane requirements for all production and processing sources in the oil and natural gas industry or, alternatively, rescind all methane requirements under the rules without removing any sources from the oil and natural gas source category. These proposed revisions have not yet been finalized and, as a result the EPA\u2019s 2012 and 2016 standards are currently in effect. Accordingly, future implementation and the ultimate scope of the 2012 and 2016 standards are uncertain at this time. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal Clean Air Act under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations.\nNumerous legislative measures have been introduced in the past that would have imposed restrictions or costs on GHG emissions, including from the oil and gas industry. Additionally, in 2010, EPA promulgated final rules for mandatory annual reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities, as well as from facilities in other industries. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding GHG reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which led to the signing of the Paris Agreement in December 2015. Although the Paris Agreement became effective in November 2016, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and in November 2019, the U.S. took another step toward withdrawal by submitting a formal notice of its withdrawal to the United Nations. Notably, the earliest date of withdrawal under the terms of the Agreement is November 4, 2020, one day after the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. Additionally, certain U.S. states or regional coalitions of states have adopted measures regulating or limiting greenhouse gases from certain sources or have adopted policies seeking to reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption and implementation of any international treaty or of any federal or state legislation or regulations imposing new or additional reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to comply with such requirements and possibly require the reduction or limitation of emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and other sources within the industrial or energy sectors. Such legislation or regulations could adversely affect demand for the production of oil and natural gas and thus reduce demand for the services we provide to oil and natural gas producers as well as increase our operating costs by requiring additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install emissions controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes and fees relating to emissions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and\nother sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which could reduce demand for our services. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs may produce changes in climate or weather, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, which if any such effects were to occur, could have adverse physical effects on our operations, physical assets and field services to exploration and production operators.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our well servicing activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide hydraulic fracturing and fluid handling services to our customers. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) to expressly exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of \u201cunderground injection.\u201d The EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and published proposed guidance relating to such practices. At the state level, several states in which we operate have adopted regulations requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nScrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, as the EPA released its report on environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing in December 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing could impact drinking water resources. The federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior published a final rule in March 2015 relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, and the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM\u2019s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule. In December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. However, in January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court, and a hearing on cross-motions for summary judgement was held in the District Court for the Northern District of California in January of 2020. These BLM hydraulic fracturing rules are in various stages of suspension, implementation, delay, rescission, and court challenges; accordingly, the future implementation and ultimate scope of these rules is uncertain. The EPA also issued a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities into publicly owned wastewater treatment plants in June 2016. In addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, that would require, with some exceptions, disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas production. Recent research has linked disposal of produced water into disposal wells to an increase in earthquakes across the South and Midwest. Certain state agencies, including those in Texas and Oklahoma, have implemented regulations authorizing the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporations Commission (\u201cOCC\u201d) has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of the National Academy of Science\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system,\u201d pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict operations at existing wells. Beginning in 2013, the OCC has ordered the reduction of disposal volumes into the Arbuckle formation. More recently, the OCC directed the shut in of a number of disposal wells due to increased earthquake activity in the Arbuckle formation and imposed further disposal well volume reductions in the Covington, Crescent, Enid, and Edmond areas. Moreover, vigorous public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continues, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.\nFurther, several cases have recently put a spotlight on the issue of whether injection wells may be regulated under the Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) if a direct hydrological connection to a jurisdictional surface water can be established. The split among federal circuit courts of appeals that decided these cases engendered two petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court in August 2018, one of which was granted in February 2019. Oral arguments were presented to the Supreme Court in November 2019, and the Court is expected to rule sometime this year (2020). EPA has also brought attention to the reach of the CWA\u2019s jurisdiction in such instances by issuing a request for comment in February 2018 regarding the applicability of the CWA permitting program to\ndischarges into groundwater with a direct hydrological connection to jurisdictional surface water, which hydrological connections should be considered \u201cdirect,\u201d and whether such discharges would be better addressed through other federal or state programs. In a statement issued by EPA in April 2019, the Agency concluded that the CWA should not be interpreted to require permits for discharges of pollutants that reach surface waters via groundwater. But should the Supreme Court rule that CWA permitting is required for saltwater injections wells, the costs of permitting and compliance for our injection well operations could increase.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation at the federal, state, tribal or local level could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our customers or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state, tribal or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could potentially increase our costs of operations and cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our well servicing activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential listing of species as \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions or delays on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, which could adversely reduce the amount of contract drilling services that we provide to such customers.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act (the \"ESA\") and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas, including support services that we provide to such operators under our contract drilling services segment. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future provide field services. Certain wildflower species, among others, are also species that have been or are being considered for protected status under the ESA and whose range can coincide with oil and natural gas production activities. The presence of protected species in areas where operators to whom we provide contract drilling services conduct exploration and production operations could impair such operators\u2019 ability to timely complete well drilling and development and, consequently, adversely affect the amount of contract drilling or other field services that we provided to such operators, which reduction of services could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nLimitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or treat water may impact the services that we can provide to our customers.\nOur water logistics operations involve the supply of significant amounts of water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing, treatment of produced and flowback water, and disposal of a variety of fluids. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water from local sources, such as restrictions that could be imposed during extreme drought conditions, may require us to find remote sources of water and transport that water to our service locations. In addition, treatment and disposal of such water after use is becoming more highly regulated and restricted, as discussed in more detail above. Thus, costs for obtaining, treating, and disposing of water could increase significantly, potentially limiting the services that we can provide to our customers. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nDiminished access to functional salt water disposal wells may adversely affect operations.\nFracking results in large volumes of produced water, much of which must be disposed of. The resulting water, which is referred to as salt water, contains significant contaminants and must be handled carefully and disposed of properly. Most salt water is disposed of at specialty disposal sites where the salt water is injected by way of a salt water disposal well into natural underground formations. If our salt water disposal wells are damaged, then salt water may contaminate the water supply in underground aquifers. As a result, we may face civil, criminal and administrative penalties by local, state and federal regulatory authorities. Such penalties may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and credit carry-forwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited as a result of issuances of equity or other transactions.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net\noperating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), Section 163(j) disallowed interest carryforwards, recognized built in losses, and certain tax credits to offset future taxable income and tax. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders changes by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nIn connection with our emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, we experienced an ownership change for the purposes of Section 382 of the Code. The ownership changes have not resulted in the expiration or limitation of any NOLs generated prior to the emergence date. However, any subsequent ownership changes under the provisions of Section 382 could eliminate, substantially limit or otherwise adversely affect the use of our NOLs in future periods. The amount of consolidated federal NOLs available as of December 31, 2019 is approximately $900.7 million.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation, as well as future U.S. tax legislation, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017, which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code which includes, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, limiting the potential deductibility of business interest expense and net operating losses, limiting the deductibility for certain types of executive compensation, and allowing for the immediate tax deduction of certain new investments instead of deductions for tax depreciation over time. Although we have estimated the impact of the Tax Act by incorporating assumptions based upon our current interpretation and analysis to date, the Tax Act is complex, far-reaching and is in a state of being clarified by regulation. Consequently, our analysis of the actual impact of its enactment on us is ongoing and subject to change as provisions of the Tax Act are clarified by regulation. Accordingly, either future regulations under the Tax Act or our further analysis of the Tax Act could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock or Warrants\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d within the meaning of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to lesser disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers. Specifically, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC\nfilings due to our status a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects and make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nThe transition of our common stock to the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOn December 17, 2019, the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) filed a Form 25 to delist our common stock from the NYSE. Effective December 3, 2019, our common stock began trading on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. Securities traded in over-the-counter markets generally have substantially less volume and liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange such as the NYSE as a result of various factors, including the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, fewer market makers in the securities and a reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage. As a result, holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling their shares and our stock price could experience additional downward pressure. Furthermore, the price of our common stock could be subject to greater volatility and could be more likely to be affected by market conditions and fluctuations, changes in our operating results, market perception of us and our business, and announcements by us or other parties with an interest in our business. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) impacting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing or limiting us from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees.\nOur outstanding warrants are exercisable for shares of our common stock. The exercise of such equity instruments could have a dilutive effect to stockholders of the Company.\nWe currently have outstanding warrants that are exercisable into 2,066,576 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $55.25 per warrant. The exercise of these warrants into our common stock could have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our existing stockholders. However, as long as our stock price is below $55.25 per share, the warrants will have limited economic value, and they may expire worthless. In addition, the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a certain percentage of the then-outstanding warrants originally issued to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a certain percentage of the then outstanding warrants approve of such amendment. The warrants will not expire until December 23, 2023 and may create an overhang on the market for, and have a negative effect on the market price of, our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, or the issuance of stock as consideration for a future acquisition, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 80,000,000 shares of common stock, of which an estimated 24,983,699 shares of common stock were outstanding as of March 12, 2020. This number includes shares issued in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, almost all of which are freely transferable without restriction or further registration pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. We also have 2,481,657 and 500,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance as equity awards under the Basic Energy Services, Inc. 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan, respectively. As of March 6, 2020, 235,276 shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding options and 578,593 shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards.\nA large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. We entered into a registration rights agreement, (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with certain of those investors pursuant to which we filed a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur, could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock will have on the price at which our common stock trades or the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, or the issuance of stock as consideration for a future acquisition may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nFollowing the completion of the Exchange Transaction the voting power of holders of our common stock was substantially diluted. Percentage ownership of holders of our common stock may also be significantly diluted.\nPursuant to the Exchange Agreement, as partial consideration for the Exchange Transaction, the Company issued to Ascribe 118,805 shares of newly issued Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, which constituted 83% of the equity interest in the Company. Each share of the newly issued Series A Preferred Stock entitles the holder to 1,000 votes (the vote number may be adjusted from time to time as provided in the Certificate of Designations) on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of common stock, voting together as a single class. As a result, the voting rights of common stock holders have been substantially reduced.\nAdditionally, each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into a number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock being so converted and (ii) the Conversion Multiple, which initially shall be 1,000 but may be adjusted from time to time as provided in the Certificate of Designations. As a result, the percentage ownership which your common stock holdings represent may be substantially diluted upon a conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock, which may have a negative effect on the market price of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 91040, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "BASX"}
