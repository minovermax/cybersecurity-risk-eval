Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the information set forth below. The following risk factors describe situations in which our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and the value of our securities may be adversely affected. You should also refer to other information included or incorporated by reference in this report.\nOur principal business depends upon our ability to make good decisions regarding the deployment of capital into new or existing partner companies and, ultimately, the performance of our partner companies, which is uncertain.\nIf we make poor decisions regarding the deployment of capital into new or existing partner companies, our business model will not succeed. Our success as a company ultimately depends on our ability to choose the right partner companies. If our partner companies do not succeed, the value of our assets could be significantly reduced and require substantial impairments or write-offs and our results of operations and the price of our common stock would be adversely affected. The risks relating to our partner companies include:\n\u2022\nmost of our partner companies have a history of operating losses and/or limited operating history;\n\u2022\nthe intense competition affecting the products and services our partner companies offer could adversely affect their businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth;\n\u2022\nthe inability to adapt to changing marketplaces;\n\u2022\nthe inability to manage growth;\n\u2022\nthe need for additional capital to fund their operations, which we may not be able to fund or which may not be available from third parties on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe inability to protect their proprietary rights and/or infringing on the proprietary rights of others;\n\u2022\nthat our partner companies could face legal liabilities from claims made against them based upon their operations, products or work;\n\u2022\nthe impact of economic downturns on their operations, results and growth prospects;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe existence of government regulations and legal uncertainties may place financial burdens on the businesses of our partner companies; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to plan for and manage catastrophic events.\nThese and other risks are discussed in detail under the caption \u201cRisks Related to Our Partner Companies\u201d below.\nOur partner companies (and the nature of our interests in them) could vary widely from period to period.\nAs part of our strategy, we continually assess the value to our shareholders of our interests in our partner companies. We also regularly evaluate alternative uses for our capital resources. As a result, depending on market conditions, growth prospects and other key factors, we may at any time:\n\u2022\nchange the individual and/or types of partner companies on which we focus;\n\u2022\nsell some or all of our interests in any of our partner companies; or\n\u2022\notherwise change the nature of our interests in our partner companies.\nTherefore, the nature of our holdings could vary significantly from period to period.\nOur consolidated financial results also may vary significantly based upon which, if any, of our partner companies are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business model does not rely upon, or plan for, the receipt of operating cash flows from our partner companies. Our partner companies generally provide us with no cash flow from their operations. We rely on cash on hand, liquidity events and our ability to generate cash from capital raising activities to finance our operations.\nWe need capital to develop new partner company relationships and to fund the capital needs of our existing partner companies. We also need cash to service and repay our outstanding debt, finance our corporate overhead and meet our existing funding commitments. As a result, we have substantial cash requirements. Our partner companies generally provide us with no\ncash flow from their operations. To the extent our partner companies generate any cash from operations, they generally retain the funds to develop their own businesses. As a result, we must rely on cash on hand, partner company liquidity events and new capital raising activities to meet our cash needs. If we are unable to find ways of monetizing our holdings or raising additional capital on attractive terms, we may face liquidity issues that will require us to curtail our new business efforts, constrain our ability to execute our business strategy and limit our ability to provide financial support to our existing partner companies.\nFluctuations in the price of the common stock of our publicly traded holdings may affect the price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, we may hold equity interests in companies that are publicly traded. Fluctuations in the market prices of the common stock of publicly traded holdings may affect the price of our common stock. Historically, the market prices of our publicly traded holdings have been highly volatile and subject to fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance.\nIntense competition from other capital providers for interests in companies could adversely affect our ability to deploy capital and result in higher valuations of partner company interests which could result in lower gains or possibly losses on our partner companies.\nWe face intense competition from other capital providers as we acquire and develop interests in our partner companies. Some of our competitors have more experience identifying, acquiring and selling companies and have greater financial and management resources, brand name recognition or industry contacts than we have. Competition from other capital providers could adversely affect our ability to deploy capital. In addition, despite making most of our acquisitions at a stage when our partner companies are not publicly traded, we may still pay higher prices for those equity interests because of higher valuations of similar public companies and competition from other acquirers and capital providers, which could result in lower gains or possibly losses.\nWe may be unable to obtain maximum value for our holdings or to sell our holdings on a timely basis.\nWe hold significant positions in our partner companies. Consequently, if we were to divest all or part of our holdings in a partner company, we may have to sell our interests at a relative discount to a price which may be received by a seller of a smaller portion. For partner companies with publicly traded stock, we may be unable to sell our holdings at then-quoted market prices. The trading volume and public float in the common stock of a publicly traded partner company may be small relative to our holdings. As a result, any significant open-market divestiture by us of our holdings in such a partner company, if possible at all, would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock and on our proceeds from such a divestiture. Additionally, we may not be able to take our partner companies public as a means of monetizing our position or creating shareholder value.\nRegistration and other requirements under applicable securities laws and contractual restrictions also may adversely affect our ability to dispose of our holdings on a timely basis.\nOur success is dependent on our senior management.\nOur success is dependent on our senior management team\u2019s ability to execute our strategy. A loss of one or more of the members of our senior management team without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business strategy may not be successful if valuations in the market sectors in which our partner companies participate decline.\nOur strategy involves creating value for our shareholders by helping our partner companies build value and, if appropriate, accessing the public and private capital markets. Therefore, our success is dependent on the value of our partner companies as determined by the public and private capital markets. Many factors, including reduced market interest, may cause the market value of our partner companies to decline. If valuations in the market sectors in which our partner companies participate decline, their access to the public and private capital markets on terms acceptable to them may be limited.\nOur partner companies could make business decisions that are not in our best interests or with which we do not agree, which could impair the value of our holdings.\nAlthough we may seek a controlling or influential equity interest and participation in the management of our partner companies, we may not be able to control the significant business decisions of our partner companies. We may have shared control or no control over some of our partner companies. In addition, although we currently own a significant, influential interest in some of our partner companies, we do not maintain a controlling interest in any of our partner companies. Acquisitions of interests in partner companies in which we share or have no control, and the dilution of our interests in or loss\nof control of partner companies, will involve additional risks that could cause the performance of our interests and our operating results to suffer, including:\n\u2022\nthe management of a partner company having economic or business interests or objectives that are different from ours; and\n\u2022\nthe partner companies not taking our advice with respect to the financial or operating issues they may encounter.\nOur inability to control our partner companies also could prevent us from assisting them, financially or otherwise, or could prevent us from liquidating our interests in them at a time or at a price that is favorable to us. Additionally, our partner companies may not act in ways that are consistent with our business strategy. These factors could hamper our ability to maximize returns on our interests and cause us to incur losses on our interests in these partner companies.\nWe may have to buy, sell or retain assets when we would otherwise not wish to do so in order to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates companies which are engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. Under the Investment Company Act, a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, unless an exemption or safe harbor applies. We refer to this test as the \u201c40% Test.\u201d Securities issued by companies other than consolidated partner companies are generally considered \u201cinvestment securities\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act, unless other circumstances exist which actively involve the company holding such interests in the management of the underlying company. We are a company that partners with growth-stage companies to build value; we are not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We are in compliance with the 40% Test. Consequently, we do not believe that we are an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nWe monitor our compliance with the 40% Test and seek to conduct our business activities to comply with this test. It is not feasible for us to be regulated as an investment company because the Investment Company Act rules are inconsistent with our strategy of actively helping our partner companies in their efforts to build value. In order to continue to comply with the 40% Test, we may need to take various actions which we would otherwise not pursue. For example, we may need to retain a controlling interest in a partner company that we no longer consider strategic, we may not be able to acquire an interest in a company unless we are able to obtain a controlling ownership interest in the company, or we may be limited in the manner or timing in which we sell our interests in a partner company. Our ownership levels also may be affected if our partner companies are acquired by third parties or if our partner companies issue stock which dilutes our ownership interest. The actions we may need to take to address these issues while maintaining compliance with the 40% Test could adversely affect our ability to create and realize value at our partner companies.\nEconomic disruptions and downturns may have negative repercussions for us.\nEvents in the United States and international capital markets, debt markets and economies may negatively impact our ability to pursue certain tactical and strategic initiatives, such as accessing additional public or private equity or debt financing for us or for our partner companies and selling our interests in partner companies on terms acceptable to us and in time frames consistent with our expectations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in a material weakness, or could result in material misstatements in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of our Consolidated Financial Statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and/or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Partner Companies\nMost of our partner companies have a history of operating losses and/or limited operating history and may never be profitable.\nMost of our partner companies have a history of operating losses and/or limited operating history, have significant historical losses and may never be profitable. Many have incurred substantial costs to develop and market their products, have incurred net losses and cannot fund their cash needs from operations. We expect that the operating expenses of certain of our\npartner companies will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as they continue to develop products and services, increase sales and marketing efforts, and expand operations.\nOur partner companies face intense competition, which could adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth.\nThere is intense competition in the technology and healthcare marketplaces, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth will be materially adversely affected if our partner companies are not able to compete successfully. Many of the present and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than those of our partner companies. This may place our partner companies at a disadvantage in responding to the offerings of their competitors, technological changes or changes in client requirements. Also, our partner companies may be at a competitive disadvantage because many of their competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive client bases and a broader range of product offerings. In addition, our partner companies may compete against one another.\nThe success or failure of many of our partner companies is dependent upon the ultimate effectiveness of newly-created information technologies, medical devices, healthcare diagnostics, etc.\nOur partner companies\u2019 business strategies are often highly dependent upon the successful launch and commercialization of an innovative information technology, medical device, healthcare diagnostic, or similar device or technology. Despite all of our efforts to understand the research and development underlying the innovation or creation of such technologies before we deploy capital into a partner company, sometimes the performance of the technology or device does not match our expectations or those of our partner company. In those situations, it is likely that we will incur a partial or total loss of the capital which we deployed in such partner company.\nOur partner companies may fail if they do not adapt to changing marketplaces.\nIf our partner companies fail to adapt to changes in technology and customer and supplier demands, they may not become or remain profitable. There is no assurance that the products and services of our partner companies will achieve or maintain market penetration or commercial success, or that the businesses of our partner companies will be successful.\nThe healthcare and technology marketplaces are characterized by:\n\u2022\nrapidly changing technology;\n\u2022\nevolving industry standards;\n\u2022\nfrequently introducing new products and services;\n\u2022\nshifting distribution channels;\n\u2022\nevolving government regulation;\n\u2022\nfrequently changing intellectual property landscapes; and\n\u2022\nchanging customer demands.\nOur future success will depend on our partner companies\u2019 ability to adapt to these evolving marketplaces. They may not be able to adequately or economically adapt their products and services, develop new products and services or establish and maintain effective distribution channels for their products and services. If our partner companies are unable to offer competitive products and services or maintain effective distribution channels, they will sell fewer products and services and forego potential revenue, possibly causing them to lose money. In addition, we and our partner companies may not be able to respond to the marketplace changes in an economically efficient manner, and our partner companies may become or remain unprofitable.\nOur partner companies may grow rapidly and may be unable to manage their growth.\nWe expect some of our partner companies to grow rapidly. Rapid growth often places considerable operational, managerial and financial strain on a business. To successfully manage rapid growth, our partner companies must, among other things:\n\u2022\nimprove, upgrade and expand their business infrastructures;\n\u2022\nscale up production operations;\n\u2022\ndevelop appropriate financial reporting controls;\n\u2022\nattract and maintain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nmaintain appropriate levels of liquidity.\nIf our partner companies are unable to manage their growth successfully, their ability to respond effectively to competition and to achieve or maintain profitability will be adversely affected.\nBased on our business model, some or all of our partner companies will need to raise additional capital to fund their operations at any given time. We may not be able to fund some or all of such amounts and such amounts may not be available from third parties on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe cannot be certain that our partner companies will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms when needed, if at all. Because our resources and our ability to raise capital are not unlimited, we may not be able to provide partner companies with sufficient capital resources to enable them to reach a cash-flow positive position, even if we wish to do so. General economic disruptions and downturns may also negatively affect the ability of some of our partner companies to fund their operations from other stockholders and capital sources. We also may fail to accurately project the capital needs of partner companies. If partner companies need capital but are not able to raise capital from us or other outside sources, then they may need to cease or scale back operations. In such event, our interest in any such partner company will become less valuable.\nEconomic disruptions and downturns may negatively affect our partner companies\u2019 plans and their results of operations.\nMany of our partner companies are largely dependent upon outside sources of capital to fund their operations. Disruptions in the availability of capital from such sources will negatively affect the ability of such partner companies to pursue their business models and will force such companies to revise their growth and development plans accordingly. Any such changes will, in turn, negatively affect our ability to realize the value of our capital deployments in such partner companies.\nIn addition, downturns in the economy as well as possible governmental responses to such downturns and/or to specific situations in the economy could affect the business prospects of certain of our partner companies, including, but not limited to, in the following ways: weaknesses in the financial services industries; reduced business and/or consumer spending; and/or systemic changes in the ways the healthcare system operates in the United States.\nSome of our partner companies may be unable to protect their proprietary rights and may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nOur partner companies assert various forms of intellectual property protection. Intellectual property may constitute an important part of partner company assets and competitive strengths. Federal law, most typically copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, generally protects intellectual property rights. Although we expect that our partner companies will take reasonable efforts to protect the rights to their intellectual property, third parties may develop similar intellectual property independently. Moreover, the complexity of international trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent law, coupled with the limited resources of our partner companies and the demands of quick delivery of products and services to market, create a risk that partner company efforts to prevent misappropriation of their technology will prove inadequate.\nSome of our partner companies also license intellectual property from third parties and it is possible that they could become subject to infringement actions based upon their use of the intellectual property licensed from those third parties. Our partner companies generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of such licensed intellectual property. However, this may not adequately protect them. Any claims against our partner companies\u2019 proprietary rights, with or without merit, could subject the companies to costly litigation and divert their technical and management personnel from other business concerns. If our partner companies incur costly litigation and their personnel are not effectively deployed, the expenses and losses incurred by our partner companies will increase and their profits, if any, will decrease.\nThird parties have and may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our partner companies based on their patents or other intellectual property claims. Even though we believe our partner companies\u2019 products do not infringe any third party\u2019s patents, they may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined that they do. They may have to obtain a license to sell their products if it is determined that their products infringe on another person\u2019s intellectual property. Our partner companies might be prohibited from selling their products before they obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require them to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against our partner companies are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, is expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nCertain of our partner companies could face legal liabilities from claims made against their operations, products or work.\nBecause manufacture and sale of certain partner company products entail an inherent risk of product liability, certain partner companies maintain product liability insurance. Although none of our current partner companies have experienced any material losses in this regard, there can be no assurance that they will be able to maintain or acquire adequate product liability insurance in the future and any product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on a partner company\u2019s financial stability, revenues and results of operations. In addition, many of the engagements of our partner companies involve projects that are critical to the operation of their clients\u2019 businesses. If our partner companies fail to meet their contractual obligations, they could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect their business, operating results and financial condition.\nPartner company contracts typically include provisions designed to limit their exposure to legal claims relating to their services and products. However, these provisions may not protect our partner companies or may not be enforceable. Also, some of our partner companies depend on their relationships with their clients and their reputation for high-quality services and integrity to retain and attract clients. As a result, claims made against our partner companies\u2019 work may damage their reputation, which in turn could impact their ability to compete for new work and negatively impact their revenue and profitability.\nOur partner companies\u2019 success depends on their ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur partner companies depend upon their ability to attract and retain senior management and key personnel, including trained technical and marketing personnel. Our partner companies also will need to continue to hire additional personnel as they expand. Although our partner companies have not been the subject of a work stoppage, any future work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on their respective operations. A shortage in the availability of the requisite qualified personnel or work stoppage would limit the ability of our partner companies to grow, to increase sales of their existing products and services, and to launch new products and services.\nGovernment regulations and legal uncertainties may place financial burdens on the businesses of our partner companies.\nFailure to comply with applicable requirements of the FDA or comparable regulation in foreign countries can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances, refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices and criminal prosecution. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostic devices and operators of laboratory facilities are subject to strict federal and state regulation regarding validation and the quality of manufacturing and laboratory facilities. Failure to comply with these quality regulation systems requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties or enforcement proceedings, including the recall of a product or a \u201ccease distribution\u201d order. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations that affect healthcare insurance policy and reimbursement (including Medicare reimbursement) could negatively affect some of our partner companies. If Medicare or private payers change the rates at which our partner companies or their customers are reimbursed by insurance providers for their products, such changes could adversely impact our partner companies.\nSome of our partner companies may be subject to significant environmental, health and safety regulation.\nSome of our partner companies may be subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as to the safety and health of manufacturing and laboratory employees. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety. Compliance with such regulations could increase operating costs at certain of our partner companies, and the failure to comply could negatively affect the operations and results of some of our partner companies.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our partner companies\u2019 businesses.\nSome of our partner companies are highly automated businesses and rely on their network infrastructure, various software applications and many internal technology systems and data networks for their customer support, development, sales and marketing and accounting and finance functions. Further, some of our partner companies provide services to their customers from data center facilities in multiple locations. Some of these data centers are operated by third parties, and the partner companies have limited control over those facilities. A disruption or failure of these systems or data centers in the event of a natural disaster, telecommunications failure, power outage, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Such an event could also prevent the partner companies from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements, particularly in respect of their SaaS offerings. While certain of our partner companies have developed certain disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, a catastrophic event that resulted in the destruction or disruption of any of their data centers or their critical business or information technology systems could severely affect their ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, their business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our partner companies\u2019 disaster recovery plans will address all of the issues they may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and their business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate them for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of their facilities or interrupt their operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent them from delivering products in a timely manner, their business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Initiatives Outside Our Core Business\nOur involvement in the mezzanine lending industry through our relationship with Penn Mezzanine could expose us to risks that differ from, and may be in addition to, to the risks that otherwise relate to our other business initiatives.\nBorrowers may default on their payments, which may have a negative effect on our financial performance.\nThrough our relationship with Penn Mezzanine, we participate in a limited number of loans and in equity securities in private middle-market companies, which involve a high degree of repayment risk. These borrowers have limited financial resources, are relatively highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain financing from other sources. Numerous factors may affect a borrower\u2019s ability to repay its loan, including the failure to meet its business plan, a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions. A borrower\u2019s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by Penn Mezzanine or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans or foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross defaults under other agreements and jeopardize such borrower\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under the participations in loans or debt interests that we hold. In addition, such borrowers may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks senior to or equally with our interests. This means that payments on such senior-ranking securities may have to be made before we receive any payments on our interests in subordinated loans or other debt securities. Deterioration in a borrower\u2019s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in any related collateral and may have a negative effect on our financial results.", "PERMNO": 46340, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "SFE"}
