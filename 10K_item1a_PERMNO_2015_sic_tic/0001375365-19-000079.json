{"cik": "1375365", "company": "Super Micro Computer, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Related Matters\nWe face risks related to being delinquent in our SEC reporting obligations.\nPrimarily due to the matters that led to our restatement of prior financial statements and the material weaknesses identified in connection therewith, which are more fully detailed in our 2017 10-K, immediately prior to the filing of this Annual Report, our SEC filings, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, March 31, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, were delinquent. Following this filing, our only delinquent report will be our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019. While we cannot give assurance as to when we will file this outstanding quarterly report, our current intention is to file it in or before January 2020, and thereafter resume a timely filing schedule with respect to our future SEC reports. We expect to continue to face many of the risks and challenges related to the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other material weaknesses may be identified in the future, which would adversely affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting;\n\u2022\nFailure to timely file our SEC reports and make our current financial information available, has placed, and will continue to place, downward pressure on our stock price and result in the continued inability of our employees to sell the shares of our common stock underlying their awards granted pursuant to our equity compensation plans, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, hiring and employee retention;\n\u2022\nFurther delay in the filing of our SEC reports will delay our ability to seek the relisting of our common stock on a national securities exchange, and as a result, may continue to reduce the liquidity of our common stock;\n\u2022\nLitigation and claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders arising out of our failure to file SEC reports on a timely basis, including the reasons and causes for such failure to file, will continue to divert management attention and resources from the operation of our business;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to recapture lost business or business opportunities due to ongoing reputational harm; and\n\u2022\nNegative reports or actions on our commercial credit ratings would increase our costs of, or reduce our access to, future commercial credit arrangements and limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness.\nIf one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2019 due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls, and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2019 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, all as described in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report. While we have initiated remediation measures to address the identified material weaknesses, we cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective in the future. We also cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue our control remediation activities and to continue to improve our overall control environment and our operational, information technology, financial systems, and infrastructure procedures and controls, as well as to continue to train, retain and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal controls. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time on compliance-related issues. If we are unable to successfully complete our remediation efforts or favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our operating results, financial position, ability to accurately report our financial results and timely file our SEC reports, and stock price could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Restated financial statements and failures in internal controls may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor and customer confidence in our management or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors and customers, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of\nour common stock, subject us to further regulatory investigations, potential penalties or stockholder litigation, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe circumstances that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K, and our efforts to investigate, assess and remediate those matters have also caused substantial delays in the preparation and filing of our annual and quarterly reports for periods after June 30, 2017, including this Annual Report.\nOur ability to resume a timely filing schedule with respect to our SEC reporting is subject to a number of contingencies, including whether and how quickly we are able to effectively remediate the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot give assurances as to when we will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, our current intention is to file it in or before January 2020, and thereafter resume a timely filing schedule with respect to our future SEC reports.\nInvestors will need to evaluate certain decisions with respect to our common stock in light of our lack of current financial information due to our inability to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, on a timely basis. Accordingly, any investment in our common stock involves a greater degree of risk. Our lack of current public information may have an adverse impact on investor confidence, which could lead to a reduction in our stock price. In addition, for so long as we are not current in our SEC filings, we are precluded from registering our securities with the SEC for offer and sale. This precludes us from raising debt or equity financing in the public markets, limits our access to the private markets and also limits our ability to use stock options and other equity-based awards to attract, retain and provide incentives to our employees.\nThe delisting of our common stock may continue to have a material adverse effect on the trading and price of our common stock, and we cannot assure you that our common stock will be relisted, or that once relisted, it will remain listed.\nAs a result of the delay in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, we were unable to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards and our common stock was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market effective August 23, 2018 and formally delisted effective March 22, 2019.\nThe delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things, causing investors to dispose of our shares and limiting:\n\u2022\nThe liquidity of our common stock;\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nThe number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our common stock;\n\u2022\nThe availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nThe number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain equity or debt financing for the continuation of our operations.\nFollowing the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019 and any other required filings with the SEC, and compliance with any other prerequisite requirements, we intend to apply to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange. However, while we are working expeditiously to relist our common stock, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to relist our common stock, or even if our common stock is relisted, no assurance can be provided that an active trading market will develop or, if one develops, that it will continue. The lack of an active trading market may limit the liquidity of an investment in our common stock, meaning you may not be able to sell any shares of common stock you own at times, or at prices, attractive to you. Any of these factors may materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe outcome of litigation and other claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders arising out of the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K and our other SEC reports are unpredictable, and any orders, actions or rulings not in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur company and certain of our current and former executive officers are defendants in certain legal proceedings and putative class actions. Please see Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d These proceedings have resulted in significant expenses and the diversion of management attention from our business. In addition, the circumstances that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K and our continued SEC filing delays have created the risk of additional litigation and claims by investors and examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders by regulatory authorities. These include a broad range of potential actions that may be taken against us by the SEC or other regulatory agencies, including a cease and desist order, suspension of trading\nof our securities, deregistration of our securities, sanctioning of our officers and directors and/or the assessment of possible civil monetary penalties. Any such further actions could be expensive and damaging to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred significant expenses related to the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, and any resulting litigation.\nWe have devoted substantial internal and external resources towards investigating, discovering, understanding and remediating the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K (all as described in the 2017 10-K). As a result of these efforts, we have incurred substantial incremental fees and expenses for additional accounting, financial and other consulting and professional services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. Specifically, in connection with these efforts, we incurred professional fees of approximately $67 million in fiscal year 2019 and $42 million in fiscal year 2018, and we continue to incur additional fees in the current fiscal year. We have taken a number of steps in order to strengthen our corporate culture, sales processes, and accounting function so as to allow us to be able to provide timely and accurate financial reporting. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be required to devote significant additional time and incur significant additional expenses. Even if these steps are successful, we expect to continue to incur significant legal fees in future periods as we address litigation and regulatory action arising from the matters that led to the delay in the filing our 2017 10-K. The expenses we are incurring in this regard, as well as the substantial time devoted by our management to identify and address the internal control deficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to become current in our SEC reports by June 30, 2020, we may lose the right to convert our existing credit facility into a five-year revolving credit facility, and may be unable to access outside financing.\nUnder the terms of the credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (\u201cBank of America\u201d), dated April 19, 2018, as amended in June 2019, we are required to deliver our audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019 by March 31, 2020. With the filing of this Annual Report, we have satisfied that requirement. The credit facility expires on June 30, 2020, although we have the right to convert it to a five-year revolving credit facility if we are current in all SEC filing obligations and meet certain other conditions. If we are unable to become current in our SEC filing obligations by that date, we may lose the ability to elect for such a conversion, and any amounts then outstanding under the existing credit facility could become due and payable. As of November 30, 2019, we did not have any outstanding principal obligations under the Bank of America credit facility.\nWe may be unable to secure other outside financing, if needed, to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs. Any sources of financing that may be available to us could also be at higher costs and require us to satisfy more restrictive covenants, which could limit or restrict our operations, cash flows and earnings. We cannot ensure that additional financing would be available to us, or be sufficient or available on satisfactory terms. In addition, unless and until we have filed all required reports with the SEC, we will be precluded from registering our securities with the SEC for offer and sale, and the failure to timely file our SEC reports will limit our ability to use \u201cshort-form\u201d Form S-3 registration statements for registering our securities for sale with the SEC until we again meet the filing requirements of Form S-3 including having timely filed all Exchange Act reports required to be filed during the twelve calendar months prior to the filing of the registration statement on Form S-3.\nThe matters leading to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K and our lack of effective internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers, have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focused on the matters that led to the delay in the filing of our 2017 10-K. We may be adversely impacted by negative reactions to this publicity from our customers or others with whom we do business. Concerns include the time and effort required to address our accounting and control environment and our ability to be a long-term provider to our customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our operating results, financial position and stock price could be adversely affected.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports, and annually our independent auditors must attest to and\nreport on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. It is necessary for us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting to prevent fraud and errors and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures so that we can provide timely and reliable financial and other information. A failure to maintain adequate internal controls may adversely affect our ability to provide financial statements that accurately reflect our financial condition and report information on a timely basis.\nAs described in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report, we have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of June 30, 2019. This adversely affected our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that other errors or material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are working to remediate our material weaknesses, and are focused on re-establishing effective internal controls over financial reporting in order to prevent and detect material misstatements in our annual and quarterly financial statements and prevent fraud, we cannot ensure that such efforts will be effective. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls in future periods, this could further cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, and our operating results, financial position and stock price could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate in the future, which could cause rapid declines in our stock price.\nWe believe that our quarterly operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuation due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nFluctuations based upon seasonality, with the quarters ending March 31 and September 30 typically being weaker;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in the timing and size of large customer orders;\n\u2022\nVariability of our margins based on the mix of server and storage systems, subsystems and accessories we sell and the percentage of our sales to internet data center, cloud computing customers or certain geographical regions;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in availability and costs associated with key components, particularly memory, storage solutions, and other materials needed to satisfy customer requirements;\n\u2022\nThe timing of the introduction of new products by leading microprocessor vendors and other suppliers;\n\u2022\nChanges in our product pricing policies, including those made in response to new product announcements;\n\u2022\nMix of whether customer purchases are of partially or fully integrated systems or subsystems and accessories and whether made directly or through our indirect sales channel partners;\n\u2022\nThe effect of mergers and acquisitions among our competitors, suppliers, customers, or partners;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions in our geographic markets;\n\u2022\nGeopolitical tensions, including trade wars, tariffs and/or sanctions in our geographic markets;\n\u2022\nImpact of regulatory changes on our cost of doing business; and\n\u2022\nCosts associated with the circumstances leading to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements, and our efforts to investigate, assess and remediate those matters, as well as related legal proceedings.\nIn addition, customers may hesitate to purchase, or not continue to purchase, our products based upon our delay in the filing of our reports with the SEC and/or past unwarranted reports about security risks associated with the use of our products. Accordingly, it is difficult to accurately forecast our growth and results of operations on a quarterly basis. If we fail to meet expectations of investors or analysts, our stock price may fall rapidly and without notice. Furthermore, the fluctuation of quarterly operating results may render less meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our operating results, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance.\nAs we increasingly target larger customers and larger sales opportunities, our customer base may become more concentrated, our cost of sales may increase, our margins may be lower and our sales may be less predictable.\nWe have become increasingly dependent upon larger sales to grow our business. In particular, in recent years, we have completed larger sales to leading internet data center and cloud customers and large enterprise customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 or 2017. If customers buy our products in greater volumes and their business becomes a larger percentage of our net sales, we may grow increasingly dependent on those customers to maintain our growth. If our largest customers do not purchase our products at the levels, in the timeframes or within the geographies that we expect, our ability to maintain or grow our net sales will be adversely affected.\nIncreased sales to larger customers may also cause fluctuations in results of operations. Large orders are generally subject to intense competition and pricing pressure which can have an adverse impact on our margins and results of operations. Likewise, larger customers may seek to fulfill all or substantially all of their requirements in a single or a few orders, and not make another significant purchase for a substantial period of time. Accordingly, a significant increase in revenue during the period in which we recognize the revenue from a large customer may be followed by a period of time during which the customer either does not purchase any products or only a small number of our products.\nAdditionally, as we and our partners focus increasingly on selling to larger customers and attracting larger orders, we expect greater costs of sales. Our sales cycle may become longer and more expensive, as larger customers typically spend more time negotiating contracts than smaller customers. Larger customers often seek greater levels of support in the implementation and use of our server solutions.\nAs a result of the above factors, our quarter-to-quarter results of operations may be subject to greater fluctuation and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock to decline in value.\nWe typically provide forward looking financial guidance when we announce our financial results from the prior quarter. We undertake no obligation to update such guidance at any time. Frequently in the past, our financial results have failed to meet the guidance we provided. There are a number of reasons why we have failed to meet guidance in the past and might fail again in the future, including, but not limited to, the factors described in these Risk Factors.\nIncreases in average selling prices for our server solutions have significantly contributed to increases in net sales in some of the periods covered by this Annual Report. Such prices are subject to decline if customers do not continue to purchase our latest generation products or additional components, which could harm our results of operations.\nIncreases in average selling prices for our server solutions have significantly contributed to increases in net sales in some of the periods covered by this Annual Report. As with most electronics based products, average selling prices of server and storage products are typically highest at the time of introduction of new products, which utilize the latest technology, and tend to decrease over time as such products become commoditized and are ultimately replaced by even newer generation products. We cannot predict the timing or amount of any decline in the average selling prices of our server solutions that we may experience in the future. In some instances, our agreements with our indirect sales channel partners limit our ability to reduce prices unless we make such price reductions available to them, or price protect their inventory. If we are unable to decrease the average per unit manufacturing costs faster than the rate at which average selling prices continue to decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur cost structure and ability to deliver server solutions to customers in a timely manner may be adversely affected by volatility of the market for core components and certain materials for our products.\nPrices of certain materials and core components utilized in the manufacture of our server and storage solutions, such as serverboards, chassis, CPUs, memory, hard drives and SSDs, represent a significant portion of our cost of sales. We generally do not enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials and core components, but instead purchase these materials and components on a purchase order basis. Prices of these core components and materials are volatile, and, as a result, it is difficult to predict expense levels and operating results. In addition, if our business growth renders it necessary or appropriate to transition to longer term contracts with materials and core component suppliers, our costs may increase and our gross margins could correspondingly decrease.\nBecause we often acquire materials and key components on an as needed basis, we may be limited in our ability to effectively and efficiently respond to customer orders because of the then-current availability or the terms and pricing of these materials and key components. Our industry has experienced materials shortages and delivery delays in the past, and we may experience shortages or delays of critical materials in the future. From time to time, we have been forced to delay the introduction of certain of our products or the fulfillment of customer orders as a result of shortages of materials and key components, which can adversely impact our revenue. If shortages, supply or demand imbalances or delays arise, the prices of these materials and key components may increase or the materials and key components may not be available at all. In the event of shortages, some of our larger competitors may have greater abilities to obtain materials and key components due to their larger purchasing power. We may not be able to secure enough key components or materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products to meet customer demand, which could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, we have accepted customer orders with various types of component pricing protection. Such arrangements have increased our exposure to component pricing fluctuations and have adversely affected our financial results in certain quarters.\nIf we were to lose any of our current supply or contract manufacturing relationships, the process of identifying and qualifying a new supplier or contract manufacturer who will meet our quality and delivery requirements, and who will appropriately safeguard our intellectual property, may require a significant investment of time and resources, adversely affecting our ability to satisfy customer purchase orders and delaying our ability to rapidly introduce new products to market. Similarly, if any of our suppliers were to cancel, materially change contracts or commitments to us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer demand for our products, whether due to shortages or other reasons, our reputation and relationships with customers could be damaged. We could lose orders, be unable to develop or sell some products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased revenues, margins and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for our products and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. We market and sell our products both domestically and in international markets. If economic conditions, including currency exchange rates, in the areas in which we market and sell our products and other key potential markets for our products continue to remain uncertain or deteriorate, our customers may delay or reduce their spending on our products. If our customers or potential customers experience economic hardship, this could reduce the demand for our products, delay and lengthen sales cycles, lower prices for our products, and lead to slower growth or even a decline in our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may lose sales or incur unexpected expenses relating to insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory.\nTo offer greater choices and optimization of our products to benefit our customers, we maintain a high level of inventory. If we fail to maintain sufficient inventory, we may not be able to meet demand for our products on a timely basis, and our sales may suffer. If we overestimate customer demand for our products, we could experience excess inventory of our products and be unable to sell those products at a reasonable price, or at all. As a result, we may need to record higher inventory reserves. In addition, from time to time we assume greater inventory risk in connection with the purchase or manufacture of more specialized components in connection with higher volume sales opportunities. We have from time to time experienced inventory write downs associated with higher volume sales that were not completed as anticipated. We expect that we will experience such write downs from time to time in the future related to existing and future commitments. Excess or obsolete inventory levels for these or other reasons could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves against potential future charges which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may encounter difficulties with our ERP systems.\nMany companies have experienced delays and difficulties with the implementation of new or changed ERP systems that have had a negative effect on their business. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses related to our ERP systems, as we continue to further enhance and develop them, including by automating certain internal controls. See Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Annual Report for a more fulsome description of our material weaknesses and remediation efforts surrounding our ERP systems. Any future disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and further enhancement of our ERP system could result in potentially much higher costs than we currently anticipate and could adversely affect our ability to provide services, fulfill contractual obligations, file reports with the SEC in a timely manner and/or otherwise operate our business, or otherwise impact our controls environment. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSystem security violations, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber-security issues could disrupt our internal operations or compromise the security of our products, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. While we employ a number of protective measures, including firewalls, anti-virus and endpoint detection and response technologies, these measures may fail to prevent or detect attacks on our systems. We experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network between 2011 and 2018. None of\nthese intrusions, individually or in the aggregate, has had a material adverse effect on our business, operations, or products. We have taken steps to enhance the security of our network and computer systems but, despite these efforts, we may experience future intrusions, which could adversely affect our business, operations, or products. In addition, our hardware and software or third party components and software that we utilize in our products may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation or security of the products. The costs to us to eliminate or mitigate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and, if our efforts to address these problems are not successful, could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Any claim that our products or systems are subject to a cyber-security risk, whether valid or not, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business as well as information from our suppliers and customers. Breaches of our or any of our third party suppliers\u2019 security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or suppliers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us or our customers or suppliers to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nTo the extent we experience cyber-security incidents in the future, our relationships with our customers and suppliers may be materially impacted, our brand and reputation may be harmed and we could incur substantial costs in responding to and remediating the incidents and in resolving any investigations or disputes that may arise with respect to them, any of which would cause our business, operations, or products to be adversely affected. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing and adding further data protection measures could be significant.\nBecause our products and services may store, process and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters, which are subject to change.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries that involve matters central to our business, including with respect to user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, protection of minors and consumer protection. These laws can be particularly restrictive in countries outside the United States. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations constantly evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because our products and services store, process and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and even our inadvertent failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in investigations, claims, damages to our reputation, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations and declines in user growth, retention or engagement, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant.\nGlobal privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity for privacy and data protection are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, imposes stringent EU data protection requirements on companies established in the European Union or companies that offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in the European Union. The GDPR establishes a robust framework of data subjects\u2019 rights and imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million euros or four percent of annual global revenue. In addition, numerous states in the U.S. are also expanding data protection through legislation. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect on January 1, 2020, and will give California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provide for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. At the same time, certain developing countries in which we do business have already or are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations. While we have implemented policies and procedures to address GDPR and other data privacy requirements, failure to comply or concerns about our practices or compliance with GDPR or other privacy-related laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not successfully manage the expansion of our international manufacturing capacity, our business could be harmed.\nSince inception, we have conducted a substantial majority of our manufacturing operations in San Jose, California. We continue to increase our manufacturing capacity in Taiwan and in the Netherlands. If we are unable to successfully ramp up our international manufacturing capacity, we may incur unanticipated costs, difficulties in making timely delivery of products or suffer other business disruptions which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our business for growth and expansion.\nOver time we expect to continue to make investments to pursue new customers and expand our product offerings to grow our business. We expect that our annual operating expenses will continue to increase as we invest in sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing and production infrastructure, and strengthen customer service and support resources for our customers. Our failure to expand operational and financial or internal control systems timely or efficiently could result in additional operating inefficiencies, which could increase our costs and expenses more than we had planned and prevent us from successfully executing our business plan. We may not be able to offset the costs of operation expansion by leveraging the economies of scale from our growth in negotiations with our suppliers and contract manufacturers. Additionally, if we increase our operating expenses in anticipation of the growth of our business and this growth does not meet our expectations, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nIf our business grows, we will have to manage additional product design projects, materials procurement processes and sales efforts and marketing for an increasing number of SKUs, as well as expand the number and scope of our relationships with suppliers, distributors and end customers. If we fail to manage these additional responsibilities and relationships successfully, we may incur significant costs, which may negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, in our efforts to be first to market with new products with innovative functionality and features, we may devote significant research and development resources to products and product features for which a market does not develop quickly, or at all. If we are not able to predict market trends accurately, we may not benefit from such research and development activities, and our results of operations may suffer.\nManaging our business for long-term growth also requires us to successfully manage a substantial increase in our number of employees. We must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. Our failure to timely file our SEC reports and the delisting of our common stock on Nasdaq has adversely impacted our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees and will likely continue to adversely impact us as long as these circumstances persist. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. The additional headcount we have added and may continue to add has increased and will continue to increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.\nOur future effective income tax rates could be affected by changes in the relative mix of our operations and income among different geographic regions and by changes in domestic and foreign income tax laws, which could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe seek to structure our worldwide operations to take advantage of certain international tax planning opportunities and incentives. Our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge our international tax structure or if the relative mix of our United States and international income changes for any reason, or due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws. In particular, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the United States. Prior to December 22, 2017, foreign withholding taxes and United States income taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-United States subsidiaries, because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201c2017 Tax Reform Act\u201d). As a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, we recorded a one-time write down of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, and a one-time transition tax, in our income tax provision for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We expect further guidance may be forthcoming from federal and state tax agencies, which could result in additional impacts. See Part II, Item 8, Note 14, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further discussion of the impact of the 2017 Tax Reform Act.\nThe effectiveness of our tax planning activities is based upon certain assumptions that we make regarding our future operating performance and tax laws. We continue to optimize our tax structure to align with our business operations and growth\nstrategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to lower our effective tax rate as a result of our current or future tax planning activities nor that such rate will not increase in the future.\nIf negative publicity arises with respect to us, our employees, our third-party service providers or our partners, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, regardless of whether the negative publicity is true.\nNegative publicity about our company or our products, even if inaccurate or untrue, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in our products, which could harm our business and operating results. For example, in October 2018, a news article was published alleging that malicious hardware chips were implanted on our motherboards during the manufacturing process at the facilities of a contract manufacturer in China. We undertook a thorough investigation of this claim with the assistance of a leading, independent third-party investigations firm wherein we tested a representative sample of our motherboards, including the specific type of motherboard depicted in the news article and motherboards purchased by companies referenced in the article, as well as more recently manufactured motherboards. After completing these examinations as well as a range of functional tests, the investigations firm reported that it had found no evidence of malicious hardware on our motherboards. In addition, neither the publisher of the news article nor any of our customers have ever provided a single example of any such altered motherboard. However, despite repeated denials of any tampering by our customers and us, and the announcement of the results of this independent investigation, this false allegation had a substantial negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and our reputation and it may continue to have a negative impact in the future.\nHarm to our reputation can also arise from many other sources, including employee misconduct, as has been experienced in the past, and misconduct by our partners and outsourced service providers. Additionally, negative publicity with respect to our partners or service providers could also affect our business and operating results to the extent that we rely on these partners or if our customers or prospective customers associate our company with these partners.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, we may not be able to increase our market penetration, grow our net sales or improve our gross margins.\nThe market for server and storage solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market continues to evolve with the growth of public cloud shifting server and storage purchasing from traditional data centers to lower margin public cloud vendors. Barriers to entry in our market are relatively low and we expect increased challenges from existing as well as new competitors. Some of our principal competitors offer server solutions at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures on sales of our server solutions. We expect further downward pricing pressure from our competitors and expect that we will have to price some of our server and storage solutions aggressively to increase our market share with respect to those products or geographies, particularly for internet data center and cloud customers and other large sale opportunities. If we are unable to maintain the margins on our server and storage solutions, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if we do not develop new innovative solutions, or enhance the reliability, performance, efficiency and other features of our existing server and storage solutions, our customers may turn to our competitors for alternatives. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally may also result in reduced sales, less efficient utilization of our manufacturing operations, lower margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur principal competitors include global technology companies such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, and Lenovo. In addition, we also compete with a number of other vendors who also sell application optimized servers, contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers (\u201cODMs\u201d), such as Inspur, Quanta Computer, and Wiwynn Corporation. ODMs sell server solutions marketed or sold under a third-party brand.\nMany of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:\n\u2022\nGreater name recognition and deeper market penetration;\n\u2022\nLonger operating histories;\n\u2022\nLarger sales and marketing organizations and research and development teams and budgets;\n\u2022\nMore established relationships with customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers and better channels to reach larger customer bases and larger sales volume allowing for better costs;\n\u2022\nLarger customer service and support organizations with greater geographic scope;\n\u2022\nA broader and more diversified array of products and services; and\n\u2022\nSubstantially greater financial, technical and other resources.\nSome of our current or potential ODM competitors are also currently or have in the past been suppliers to us. As a result, they may possess sensitive knowledge or experience which may be used against us competitively and/or which may\nrequire us to alter our supply arrangements or sources in a way which could adversely impact our cost of sales or results of operations.\nOur competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Competitors may seek to copy our innovations and use cost advantages from greater size to compete aggressively with us on price. Certain customers are also current or prospective competitors and as a result, assistance that we provide to them as customers may ultimately result in increased competitive pressure against us. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our application optimized server and storage solutions are more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products in lieu of purchasing our products. The challenges we face from larger competitors will become even greater if consolidation or collaboration between or among our competitors occurs in our industry. Also, initiatives like the Open Compute Project, a project to establish more industry standard data center configurations, could have the impact of supporting an approach which is less favorable to the flexibility and customization that we offer. These changes could have a significant impact on the market and impact our results of operations. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and if we do not compete effectively, our ability to increase our net sales may be impaired.\nAny failure to adequately expand or retain our sales force will impede our growth.\nWe expect that our direct sales force will continue to grow as larger customers increasingly require a direct sales approach. Competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need is intense, and we face significant competition for direct sales personnel from our competitors. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, retaining and successfully managing sufficient qualified direct sales personnel. We have experienced much greater turnover in our sales and marketing personnel as compared to other departments and other companies, which we believe has been due in part to our employees' inability to exercise their stock options since our registration statement on Form S-8 lost its effectiveness due to our delinquent filings. New hires require significant training and may take six months or longer before they reach full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain sufficient numbers of productive sales personnel, our customer relationships and resulting sales of our server solutions will suffer.\nWe must work closely with our suppliers to make timely new product introductions.\nWe rely on our close working relationships with our suppliers, including Intel, AMD and Nvidia, to anticipate and deliver new products on a timely basis when new generation materials and key components are made available. Intel, AMD and Nvidia are the only suppliers of the microprocessors we use in our server and storage systems. If we are not able to maintain our relationships with our suppliers or continue to leverage their research and development capabilities to develop new technologies desired by our customers, our ability to quickly offer advanced technology and product innovations to our customers would be impaired. We have no long term agreements that obligate our suppliers to continue to work with us or to supply us with products.\nOur suppliers\u2019 failure to improve the functionality and performance of materials and key components for our products may impair or delay our ability to deliver innovative products to our customers.\nWe need our material and key component suppliers, such as Intel, AMD and Nvidia, to provide us with components that are innovative, reliable and attractive to our customers. Due to the pace of innovation in our industry, many of our customers may delay or reduce purchase decisions until they believe that they are receiving best of breed products that will not be rendered obsolete by an impending technological development. Accordingly, demand for new server and storage systems that incorporate new products and features is significantly impacted by our suppliers\u2019 new product introduction schedules and the functionality, performance and reliability of those new products. If our materials and key component suppliers fail to deliver new and improved materials and components for our products, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for our products in a timely manner, or at all. If our suppliers\u2019 components do not function properly, we may incur additional costs and our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials used to manufacture our products.\nCertain raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. One of our suppliers accounted for 21.8%, 26.0% and 31.0% of total purchases of raw materials for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Ablecom and Compuware, related parties, accounted for 9.2%, 9.0% and 11.1% of our total\ncost of sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If any of our largest suppliers discontinue their operations or if our relationships with them are adversely impacted, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on indirect sales channels for a significant percentage of our revenue and any disruption in these channels could adversely affect our sales.\nSales of our products through our indirect sales channel accounted for 39.3%, 41.5% and 47.8% of our net sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We depend on our indirect sales channel partners to assist us in promoting market acceptance of our products and anticipate that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to result from sales through indirect channels. To maintain and potentially increase our revenue and profitability, we will have to successfully preserve and expand our existing distribution relationships as well as develop new channel relationships. Our indirect sales channel partners also sell products offered by our competitors and may elect to focus their efforts on these sales. If our competitors offer our indirect sales channel more favorable terms or have more products available to meet the needs of their customers, or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the indirect sales channel, those channel partners may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In addition, the order decision-making process in our indirect sales channel is complex and involves several factors, including end customer demand, warehouse allocation and marketing resources, which can make it difficult to accurately predict total sales for the quarter until late in the quarter. We also do not control the pricing or discounts offered by our indirect sales channel partners to the end customers. To maintain our participation in the marketing programs of our indirect sales channel partners, we have provided and expect to continue to offer cooperative marketing arrangements and offer short-term pricing concessions.\nThe discontinuation of cooperative marketing arrangements or pricing concessions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our indirect sales channel partners could also modify their business practices, such as payment terms, inventory levels or order patterns. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships in our indirect sales channel or expand our channel or we experience unexpected changes in payment terms, inventory levels or other practices in our indirect sales channel, our business will suffer.\nOur direct sales efforts may create confusion for our end customers and harm our relationships in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs.\nWe expect our direct sales force to continue to grow as our business grows. As our direct sales force becomes larger, our direct sales efforts may lead to conflicts in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs, who may view our direct sales efforts as undermining their efforts to sell our products. If an indirect sales channel partner or OEM deems our direct sales efforts to be inappropriate, they may not effectively market our products, may emphasize alternative products from competitors, or may seek to terminate our business relationship. Disruptions in our indirect channels could cause our revenues to decrease or fail to grow as expected. Our failure to implement an effective direct sales strategy that maintains and expands our relationships in our indirect sales channel and with our OEMs could lead to a decline in sales, harm relationships and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur research and development expenditures, as a percentage of our net sales, are considerably higher than many of our competitors and our earnings will depend upon maintaining revenues and margins that offset these expenditures.\nOur strategy is to focus on being consistently rapid-to-market with flexible and application optimized server and storage systems that take advantage of our own internal development and the latest technologies offered by microprocessor manufacturers and other component vendors. Consistent with this strategy, we spend higher amounts, as a percentage of revenues, on research and development costs than many of our competitors. If we cannot sell our products in sufficient volume and with adequate gross margins to compensate for such investment in research and development, our earnings may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to deliver high quality server and storage solutions could damage our reputation and diminish demand for our products.\nOur server and storage solutions are critical to our customers\u2019 business operations. Our customers require our server and storage solutions to perform at a high level, contain valuable features and be extremely reliable. The design of our server and storage solutions is sophisticated and complex, and the process for manufacturing, assembling and testing our server solutions is challenging. Occasionally, our design or manufacturing processes may fail to deliver products of the quality that our customers require. For example, in the past certain vendors have provided us with defective components that failed under\ncertain applications. As a result, our products needed to be repaired and we incurred costs in connection with the recall and diverted resources from other projects.\nNew flaws or limitations in our server and storage solutions may be detected in the future. Part of our strategy is to bring new products to market quickly, and first-generation products may have a higher likelihood of containing undetected flaws. If our customers discover defects or other performance problems with our products, our customers\u2019 businesses, and our reputation, may be damaged. Customers may elect to delay or withhold payment for defective or underperforming server and storage solutions, request remedial action, terminate contracts for untimely delivery, or elect not to order additional products, which could result in a decrease in revenue, an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or in collection cycles for accounts receivable or subject us to the expense and risk of litigation. We may incur expense in recalling, refurbishing or repairing defective server and storage solutions sold to our customers or remaining in our inventory. If we do not properly address customer concerns about our products, our reputation and relationships with our customers may be harmed. For all of these reasons, customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products could substantially impair our ability to grow our business.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and Ablecom and Compuware, and those conflicts may adversely affect our operations.\nWe use Ablecom, a related party, for contract design and manufacturing coordination support and warehousing, and Compuware, also a related party and an affiliate of Ablecom, for distribution, contract manufacturing and warehousing. We work with Ablecom to optimize modular designs for our chassis and certain of other components. We outsource to Compuware a portion of our design activities and a significant part of our manufacturing of subassemblies, particularly power supplies. Our purchases of products from Ablecom and Compuware represented 9.2%, 9.0%, and 11.1% of our cost of sales for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Ablecom and Compuware\u2019s sales to us constitute a substantial majority of Ablecom and Compuware\u2019s net sales. Ablecom and Compuware are both privately-held Taiwan-based companies. In addition, we have entered into a distribution agreement with Compuware, under which we have appointed Compuware as a nonexclusive distributor of our products in Taiwan, China and Australia.\nSteve Liang, Ablecom\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder, is the brother of Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors (\u201cthe Board\u201d). Steve Liang owned approximately 0.4% of our common stock as of June 30, 2017, but owned no shares as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. Charles Liang and his spouse, Sara Liu, our Co-Founder, Senior Vice President and director, jointly own approximately 10.5% of Ablecom\u2019s capital stock, while Mr. Steve Liang and other family members own approximately 28.8% of Ablecom\u2019s outstanding common stock. Bill Liang, a brother of both Charles Liang and Steve Liang, also is a member of the Board of Directors of Ablecom. Certain family members of Yih-Shyan (Wally) Liaw, who until January 2018 was our Senior Vice President of International Sales and director, own approximately 11.7% of Ablecom\u2019s capital stock.\nBill Liang is also the Chief Executive Officer of Compuware, a member of Compuware\u2019s Board of Directors and a holder of a significant equity interest in Compuware. Steve Liang is also a member of Compuware\u2019s Board of Directors and is an equity holder of Compuware.\nMr. Charles Liang as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and as a significant stockholder of our company, has considerable influence over the management of our business relationships. Accordingly, we may be disadvantaged by the economic interests of Mr. Charles Liang and Ms. Sara Liu as stockholders of Ablecom and Mr. Charles Liang's personal relationship with Ablecom\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. We may not negotiate or enforce contractual terms as aggressively with Ablecom or Compuware as we might with an unrelated party, and the commercial terms of our agreements may be less favorable than we might obtain in negotiations with third parties. If our business dealings with Ablecom or Compuware are not as favorable to us as arms-length transactions, our results of operations may be harmed.\nIf Ablecom or Compuware are acquired or sold, new ownership could reassess the business and strategy of Ablecom or Compuware, and as a result, our supply chain could be disrupted or the terms and conditions of our agreements with Ablecom or Compuware may change. As a result, our operations could be negatively impacted or costs could increase, either of which could adversely affect our margins and results of operations.\nOur reliance on Ablecom could be subject to risks associated with our reliance on a limited source of contract manufacturing services and inventory warehousing.\nWe plan to continue to maintain our manufacturing relationship with Ablecom in Asia. In order to provide a larger volume of contract manufacturing services for us, we anticipate that Ablecom will continue to warehouse for us an increasing\nnumber of components and subassemblies manufactured by multiple suppliers prior to shipment to our facilities in the United States and Europe. We also anticipate that we will continue to lease office space from Ablecom in Taiwan to support our research and development efforts. We operate a joint management company with Ablecom to manage the common areas shared by us and Ablecom for our separately constructed manufacturing facilities in Taiwan.\nIf our commercial relationship with Ablecom deteriorates, we may experience delays in our ability to fulfill customer orders. Similarly, if Ablecom\u2019s facility in Asia is subject to damage, destruction or other disruptions, our inventory may be damaged or destroyed, and we may be unable to find adequate alternative providers of contract manufacturing services in the time that we or our customers require. We could lose orders and be unable to develop or sell some products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all.\nCurrently, we purchase contract manufacturing services primarily for our chassis products from Ablecom. If our commercial relationship with Ablecom were to deteriorate or terminate, establishing direct relationships with those entities supplying Ablecom with key materials for our products or identifying and negotiating agreements with alternative providers of warehouse and contract manufacturing services might take a considerable amount of time and require a significant investment of resources. Pursuant to our agreements with Ablecom and subject to certain exceptions, Ablecom has the exclusive right to be our supplier of the specific products developed under such agreements. As a result, if we are unable to obtain such products from Ablecom on terms acceptable to us, we may need to discontinue a product or develop substitute products, identify a new supplier, change our design and acquire new tooling, all of which could result in delays in our product availability and increased costs. If we need to use other suppliers, we may not be able to establish business arrangements that are, individually or in the aggregate, as favorable as the terms and conditions we have established with Ablecom. If any of these things should occur, our net sales, margins and earnings could significantly decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth into markets outside the United States exposes us to risks inherent in international business operations.\nWe market and sell our systems and subsystems and accessories both inside and outside the United States. We intend to expand our international sales efforts, especially into Asia, and we are expanding our business operations in Europe and Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Japan. In particular, we have made, and continue to make, substantial investments for the purchase of land and the development of new facilities in Taiwan to accommodate our expected growth and the migration of a substantial portion of our contract manufacturing operations from China to Taiwan. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u2022\nHeightened price sensitivity from customers in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nOur ability to establish local manufacturing, support and service functions, and to form channel relationships with value added resellers in non-United States markets;\n\u2022\nLocalization of our systems and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u2022\nCompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nForeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nLimited visibility into sales of our products by our channel partners;\n\u2022\nGreater concentration of competitors in some foreign markets than in the United States;\n\u2022\nLaws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\nWeaker legal protections of intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u2022\nMarket disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States, such as Avian flu, SARS and other diseases;\n\u2022\nImport and export tariffs;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and the costs of managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions; and\n\u2022\nChanging regional economic and political conditions.\nThese factors could limit our future international sales or otherwise adversely impact our operations or our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon our investment in corporate ventures.\nWe have a 30% minority interest in a China corporate venture that was established to market and sell corporate venture branded systems in China based upon products and technology we supply. We record earnings and losses from the\ncorporate venture using the equity method of accounting. Our loss exposure is limited to the remainder of our equity investment in the corporate venture which as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Although we currently do not intend to make any additional investment in this corporate venture, if we were to do so in the future, our exposure to potential losses would increase. We may make investments in other corporate ventures. We do not control this corporate venture and any fluctuation in the results of operations of the corporate venture or any other similar transaction that we may enter into in the future could adversely impact, or result in fluctuations in, our results of operations.\nThe United States could withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or change tariff, trade, or tax provisions related to the global manufacturing and sales of our products in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nA portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom and Japan. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we manufacture, market and sell our products globally. Starting in July 2018, the U.S. announced a series of lists covering thousands of categories of Chinese origin products subject to potential special tariffs of 10% to 25% of import value, in addition to the regular tariffs that have historically applied to such products. Many categories of Chinese imports became subject to the 10% additional tariff in September 2018, including certain components in our products. This 10% additional tariff was increased to 25% effective May 10, 2019. In addition, on August 1, 2019, President Trump announced that a special 15% tariff will be imposed on the approximately $300 billion of inbound trade from China not already subject to a special tariff. Based on prior announcements by the Trump Administration, it is possible that the special 15% tariff could be increased to 25% in the future. The precise impact of the special tariffs on Chinese products is impossible to predict at this time. As a result of these tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of any future special tariffs on Chinese products, we have begun to migrate a substantial portion of our subcontracted business operations from China to Taiwan. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the announced and other proposed tariffs on products and components that we import from China, and we may experience a material increase in the cost of our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors, or any changes to U.S. corporate tax policies related to international commerce, could depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and applicable trade control laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe manufacture and sell our products in several countries outside of the United States, both to direct and OEM customers as well as through our indirect sales channel. Our operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the countries where we do business. The FCPA prohibits covered parties from offering, promising, authorizing or giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a \u201cforeign government official\u201d with the intent of improperly influencing the official\u2019s act or decision, inducing the official to act or refrain from acting in violation of lawful duty or obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA also requires publicly traded companies to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions, and to have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In addition, other applicable anti-corruption laws prohibit bribery of domestic government officials, and some laws that may apply to our operations prohibit commercial bribery, including giving or receiving improper payments to or from non-government parties, as well as so-called \u201cfacilitation\u201d payments. In addition, we are subject to U.S. and other applicable trade control regulations that restrict with whom we may transact business, including the trade sanctions enforced by the U.S. Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations restricting dealings with sanctioned countries, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Any future violations could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell our products to United States federal, state and local government and related entities.\nIn addition, while we have implemented policies, internal controls and other measures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, and certain safeguards designed to ensure compliance with U.S. trade control laws, our employees or agents have in the past engaged and may in the future engage in improper conduct for which we could be held responsible. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these laws and regulations, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, bans on transacting government business and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,\nour brand and reputation, our sales activities or our stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery or trade control laws and regulations.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and technical know-how could impair our brand and our competitiveness.\nOur ability to prevent competitors from gaining access to our technology is essential to our success. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may lose an important advantage in the markets in which we compete. Trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as our internal confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions are the core of our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation, and we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights. Such administrative proceedings and litigation are inherently uncertain and divert resources that could be put towards other business priorities. We may not be able to obtain a favorable outcome and may spend considerable resources in our efforts to defend and protect our intellectual property.\nFurthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and using our technology for their competitive advantage. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nResolution of claims that we have violated or may violate the intellectual property rights of others could require us to indemnify our customers, indirect sales channel partners or vendors, redesign our products, or pay significant royalties to third parties, and materially harm our business.\nOur industry is marked by a large number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violation of intellectual property rights. Our primary competitors have substantially greater numbers of issued patents than we have which may position us less favorably in the event of any claims or litigation with them. Other third parties have in the past sent us correspondence regarding their intellectual property or filed claims that our products infringe or violate third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. In addition, increasingly non-operating companies are purchasing patents and bringing claims against technology companies. We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to such claims in the future.\nSuccessful intellectual property claims against us from others could result in significant financial liability or prevent us from operating our business or portions of our business as we currently conduct it or as we may later conduct it. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our technology, to obtain licenses to use intellectual property belonging to third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, to cease using the technology covered by those rights, and to indemnify our customers, indirect sales channel partners or vendors. Any claim, regardless of its merits, could be expensive and time consuming to defend against, and divert the attention of our technical and management resources.\nIf we lose Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, or any other current key employee or are unable to attract additional key employees, we may not be able to implement our business strategy in a timely manner.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our current executive management team and other current key employees. In particular, Charles Liang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, is critical to the overall management of our company as well as to our strategic direction. Mr. Liang co-founded our company and has been our Chief Executive Officer since our inception. His experience in running our business and his personal involvement in key relationships with suppliers, customers and strategic partners are extremely valuable to our company. We currently do not have a succession plan for the replacement of Mr. Liang if it were to become necessary. Additionally, we are particularly dependent on the continued service of our existing research and development personnel because of the complexity of our products and technologies. Our employment arrangements with our executives and employees do not require them to provide services to us for any specific length of time, and they can terminate their employment with us at any time, with or without notice, without penalty. The loss of services of any of these executives or of one or more other key members of our team could seriously harm our business.\nIf we are unable to attract and integrate additional key employees in a manner that enables us to scale our business and operations effectively, or if we do not maintain competitive compensation policies to retain our employees, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently could be limited.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract additional highly qualified personnel, including additional engineers and executive staff. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where we are headquartered. We have experienced in the past and may continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. The delay in the filing of our required Exchange Act period reports with the SEC precludes us from registering our securities with the SEC for offer and sale and limits our ability to use stock options and other equity-based awards to attract, retain and provide incentives to employees. Since September 2017, our employees have been unable to sell their holdings of our common stock, which has contributed to the loss of experienced engineering and sales personnel. If we are unable to attract and integrate additional key employees in a manner that enables us to scale our business and operations effectively, or if we do not maintain competitive compensation policies to retain our employees, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently could be limited.\nBacklog does not provide a substantial portion of our net sales in any quarter.\nOur net sales are difficult to forecast because we do not have sufficient backlog of unfilled orders or sufficient recurring revenue to meet our quarterly net sales targets at the beginning of a quarter. Rather, a majority of our net sales in any quarter depend upon customer orders that we receive and fulfill in that quarter. Because our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future net sales and to a large extent are fixed in the short term, we might be unable to adjust spending in time to compensate for any shortfall in net sales. Accordingly, any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations would harm our operating results.\nOur business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes and other natural catastrophic events.\nOur corporate headquarters, including our most significant research and development and manufacturing operations, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. We have also established significant manufacturing and research and development operations in Taiwan which is also subject to seismic activity risks. We do not currently have a comprehensive disaster recovery program and as a result, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we are in the process of preparing such a program, there is no assurance that it will be effective in the event of such a disaster.\nOur operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws in the future as a result of our inability to obtain permits, human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes, we could be subject to fines, costs or civil or criminal sanctions, face third-party property damage or personal injury claims or be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, which could be material, or experience disruptions in our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, environmental laws could become more stringent over time imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances applicable to specified electronic products placed on the market in the European Union (Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC, also known as the RoHS Directive). We are also subject to laws and regulations such as California\u2019s \u201cProposition 65\u201d which requires that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to certain chemicals deemed by the State of California to be dangerous, such as lead. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, and could require that we change the design and/or manufacturing of our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to the Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act concerning the supply of certain minerals coming from the conflict zones in and around the Democratic Republic of Congo. This United States legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and\nprocedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. These requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor or other devices. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile, and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased the shares.\nThe trading prices of technology company securities historically have been highly volatile and the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors, in addition to those outlined elsewhere in this filing, that may affect the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nThe risk that we are not able to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange;\n\u2022\nThe outcome of litigation and claims as well as regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders arising out of our failure to file SEC reports on a timely basis, the circumstances leading to the need to restate certain of our previously issued financial statements, and our efforts to investigate, assess and remediate related matters;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in our operating results, including failure to achieve previously provided guidance;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nChanges in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nThe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nFalse or misleading press releases or articles regarding our company or our products;\n\u2022\nThe loss of a key customer;\n\u2022\nThe loss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nTechnological advancements rendering our products less valuable;\n\u2022\nLawsuits filed against us, including those described in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d;\n\u2022\nChanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies that sell similar products;\n\u2022\nPrice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nMarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and\n\u2022\nOther events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, political instability or responses to these events.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nAttempts by existing stockholders to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly. All of our shares are eligible for sale in the public market, including shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, sales of which are subject to volume limitations and other requirements under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, shares subject to outstanding options and reserved for future issuance under our stock option plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities analysts do not resume research or reporting about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThere is currently only one industry analyst covering our common stock as of the date of this Annual Report. The research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business likely have an effect on the trading price of our common stock. If an industry analyst decides not to cover our company, or if an industry analyst decides to cease covering our company at some point in the future, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. If industry analysts do not resume research reports on our business or downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly in response.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of November 30, 2019, our executive officers, directors, current five percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially owned 24.2% of our common stock, net of treasury stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nEstablish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board are generally elected at one time, provided that in our next annual meeting we will elect all of the members of our Board due to our inability to hold annual meetings for the preceding two fiscal years;\n\u2022\nRequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nLimit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nProvide that our Board is expressly authorized to adopt, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those stockholders desire.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nEffective at the open of business on August 23, 2018, our common stock was suspended from trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and our common stock was subsequently delisted on March 22, 2019. Since the date our common stock was suspended from trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Market. The OTC Market is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, under the terms of the credit agreement with Bank of America, dated April 19, 2018, we cannot pay any dividends, with limited exceptions. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91907, "SIC": 3570, "TIC": "SMCI"}
