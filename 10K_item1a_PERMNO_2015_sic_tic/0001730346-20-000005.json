Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA decline in the production of CCRs by our coal-fired utility industry customers due to environmental regulations or otherwise could negatively impact our profitability and hinder our growth.\nMany of our services are dependent upon the production of CCRs by our coal-fired utility industry customers. The coal-fired utility industry is facing several new and pending initiatives by regulatory authorities seeking to address air and water pollution, GHG emissions, and management and disposal of CCRs. In recent years, federal and state environmental regulations have imposed more stringent requirements regarding the emission of air pollutants and other toxic chemicals, reduction of GHG emissions, and water quality impacts from coal operations. Adoption of more stringent regulations governing coal combustion, water discharges, or air emissions may decrease the amount of CCRs produced by our customers and, as a result, the demand for our services. Faced with the prospect of more stringent regulations, litigation by environmental groups, and the relatively low cost of natural gas, an increasing number of electric utilities are reducing their portfolio of coal-fired power plants. This reduction could increase if the ACE Rule, which could cause states to substitute electricity generation from higher-emitting coal plants to low-emitting coal and natural gas plants and zero-emitting renewable sources, is finalized by the EPA. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d\nIncreasingly strict requirements generally will increase the cost of doing business and may make burning coal less attractive for utilities. In recent years, multiple companies have announced plans to close coal-fired power plant units or plants, or dropped plans to open new plants, citing the cost of compliance with pending or new environmental regulations and the relatively low cost of natural gas. A reduction in the use of coal as fuel would cause a decline in the production and availability of CCRs, which would adversely affect our fossil services and byproduct sales offerings and result in reduced revenue. The outcome of these developments cannot be predicted but could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts.\nWe derive our revenue from the performance of customer contracts which itself is dependent on new contract awards. Reductions in the number and amounts of new awards, delays in the timing of the awards, or potential cancellations of such awards as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing, and availability or other factors could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will be awarded large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process that is affected by market conditions as well as regulatory requirements. We have experienced difficulty in the timely award of new projects and may again in the future. Because we generate our revenue from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement and progress of work under awarded contracts. In addition, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for a project to proceed. If we are unable to secure the awards of new contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may lose existing contracts through competitive bidding or early termination.\nMany of our contracts are for a specified term and are or will be subject to competitive rebidding after the term for such contract expires. Although we intend to bid to extend expiring contracts, we may not always be successful. In addition, some or all of our customers may terminate their contracts with us prior to their scheduled expiration dates. If we are not able to replace lost revenue resulting from unsuccessful competitive bidding, early termination, or the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenue within a reasonable period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be precluded from entering into or maintaining permits or certain contracts if we are unable to obtain sufficient third-party financial assurance or adequate insurance coverage.\nOur operations in our Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services segments sometimes require us to obtain performance or surety bonds, letters of credit, or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance. We currently obtain performance and surety bonds from multiple financial institutions; however, if we are unable to obtain financial assurance in the future in sufficient amounts from appropriately rated sureties or on acceptable terms, we could be precluded from entering into certain additional contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill management or other contracts or operating permits. Any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon having adequate insurance coverage.\nUnsatisfactory service and safety performance may negatively affect our customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenue.\nOur ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with our customers\u2019 standards of service as well as applicable laws, rules, and permits, which are subject to change. Existing and potential customers consider the safety and service record of their third-party service providers to be of high importance in their decision to engage such providers. The power generation industry generally emphasizes safety and service over cost due to economic and reputational risk associated with operations at their facilities.\nIt is possible that we will experience multiple or particularly severe accidents in the future, causing our safety record to deteriorate. This may be more likely as we continue to grow, if we experience high employee turnover or a labor shortage or hire inexperienced personnel to support our staffing needs. If one or more accidents were to occur while we are providing services to our customers, or if we were unable to maintain the level of safety and service our customers require, the affected customer may seek to terminate or cancel our services and may be less likely to use our services in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they view our safety or service record as unacceptable.\nA substantial portion of our Maintenance and Technical Services segment consists of services to nuclear power plants. To the extent there is a decrease in the number of these plants, due to reduced investment, increased regulation, or otherwise, demand for our nuclear services offerings could decrease.\nU.S. nuclear capacity and electricity generation are expected to decline due to continuing low natural gas prices and the rapid expansion of low-cost renewable energy and other new technologies in the United States, displacing more traditional sources of power, including nuclear power. Public support for nuclear power has also softened because of concerns about safety and environmental issues and new construction costs.\nThere are very few new nuclear plants and reactors under construction in the United States, and several nuclear reactors are undergoing decommissioning. In addition, changes in local, state and federal government subsidies and increased regulation could negatively impact the nuclear power industry. For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. Events at nuclear facilities or other events impacting the industry generally could lead to additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities and could negatively impact the new construction of or continued generation from nuclear power facilities. A lower number of nuclear power facilities in operation and a corresponding decrease in related maintenance and construction budgets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe limitation or modification of the PAA indemnification authority and similar federal programs for nuclear and other potentially hazardous activities could adversely affect our business.\nThe PAA provides indemnification to the nuclear industry against liability arising from nuclear incidents at non-military facilities in the United States while still ensuring compensation for the general public. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through December 31, 2025. Because we provide services to the nuclear energy industry in the ongoing maintenance and modification of its nuclear energy plants, we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the PAA. Although the PAA\u2019s indemnification provisions are broad, it does not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a contractor.\nIf the contractor protection currently provided by the PAA is significantly modified, is not reapproved, does not receive an appropriation or does not extend to all of our services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by either our clients\u2019 refusal to retain us for potentially covered services or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification, or we may be subject to potentially material liabilities in connection with the performance of our services.\nLoss of a large customer may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nFor fiscal 2019 and 2018, each of Duke Energy Corporation and Exelon Corporation accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. We will likely continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer fails to pay us promptly or at all, our revenue would be negatively impacted and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if we were to lose any material customer, such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe and our customers operate in industries subject to significant environmental regulation, and compliance with changes in, or liabilities under, such regulations could add significantly to the costs of conducting business.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that, among other matters, impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid, hazardous, and radioactive waste materials, the remediation of releases of hazardous substances, and the reclamation of land. We and our customers have obtained various federal, state, and local environmental permits to conduct our operations and we must comply with these permits and processes and procedures that have been approved by regulatory authorities. Any failure to comply with these environmental requirements could give rise to sanctions, including, but not limited to: i) the cessation of all or part of our operations, ii) substantial fines and penalties, iii) environmental or reclamation liabilities, which liabilities may be strict and joint and several and iv) damages, including natural resource damages in connection with our sites, customer sites, or sites to which we sent wastes, including CCRs, and third-party claims. Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly environmental requirements could require our customers or us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance. New regulations, any failure to comply with existing regulations, or environmental liabilities arising thereunder could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nSuccess by environmental groups in convincing the EPA to restrict beneficial uses of CCRs, or to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn April 2015, the EPA published the CCR Rule to regulate the disposal of CCRs, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired power plants, as non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA and to distinguish beneficial use of CCRs from disposal, which became effective in October 2015. The CCR Rule establishes national minimum criteria for CCR landfills and impoundments consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements, post-closure care, recordkeeping and reporting and other requirements, and requires closure of facilities unable to comply with these criteria within five to seven years. The CCR Rule has increased the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of CCRs and the remediation of existing ash ponds and landfills. In addition, Congress passed the WIIN Act in December 2016, which, among other things, authorizes state permit programs to manage CCRs in lieu of the CCR Rule. The WIIN Act also gives the EPA the authority to regulate coal ash in states that choose not to implement state permitting programs and in states whose permitting programs are determined to be inadequate by the EPA. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule that would take further steps under the WIIN Act by granting states with approved CCR permit programs (or the EPA where it is the permitting authority) the ability to set certain alternative performance standards. The rule would also allow CCRs to be used during certain closure situations and address certain matters remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2016, including clarifying corrective action triggers and requirements, adding boron to the list of constituents triggering corrective action, determining the proper height of woody and grassy vegetation for slope protection, and modifying alternative closure procedures. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule. In December 2019, the EPA addressed the deficiencies identified by the court and proposed amendments to change the closure deadline to August 31, 2020, but to allow certain extensions. The EPA has announced that it is planning additional amendments to the rule.\nSome environmental groups continue to urge the EPA to restrict certain beneficial uses of CCRs, such as in concrete, road base, and soil stabilization, alleging contaminants may leach into the environment. The CCR Rule created a definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d that includes uses in concrete and road base. Still changes in the definition could reduce the demand for fly ash and other CCRs which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. Moreover, if the EPA were to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste, we, together with CCR generators, could be subject to environmental cleanup, personal injury, and other possible claims and liabilities, which could result in significant additional costs. Any such changes in or new regulations or indemnity obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers. If any of our customers suffer financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur future results of operations may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, natural disaster, pandemic, volatility or deterioration in the capital markets or credit markets, inflation, deflation, or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business, resulting in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and their nonpayment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments. Additionally, downturns in U.S. construction could lower the demand for our byproduct sales offerings. Furthermore, uncertainty caused by the impact of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has led to increased volatility in the markets in which we operate. The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic or the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could lead to decreased revenue and limit our ability to execute on our business plan, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also provide service to power generators. To the extent these entities suffer significant financial difficulties, they could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or to renew contracts with us on attractive terms. The inability of our customers, particularly larger customers, to pay us promptly or to pay increased rates could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in the course of our business, we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event of the financial distress or bankruptcy of a customer, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenue to us.\nWork stoppages, union negotiations, health crisis and other labor problems could adversely affect us.\nA lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of the facilities where we provide nuclear services could have a material adverse effect on us. From time to time, we are subject to unfair labor practice charges, complaints, and other legal administrative and arbitration proceedings initiated against us by unions, the National Labor Relations Board, or our employees, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, additional groups of our employees may seek union representation in the future. Negotiating collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention, which could also adversely affect operating results. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with our unionized employees, we may be subject to labor disruptions, such as union-initiated work stoppages, including strikes. Pandemics including the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 or other crises could adversely impact our labor workforce for our Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services operations. Labor is one of our highest costs and depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions, our operating expenses could increase significantly, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in labor costs or our ability to find, employ and deploy technically skilled labor could impact our financial results.\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Additionally, we hire a significant percentage of our nuclear services employees on a short-term basis as a result of the seasonal (typically every 12 to 24 months) outage maintenance services we provide. We compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified employees. From time to time, the labor supply is tight in some of our markets. A shortage of qualified employees would require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages to compete more effectively for employees, to hire more expensive temporary employees or to contract for services with more expensive third-party vendors. Labor is one of our highest costs and relatively small increases in labor costs per employee could materially affect our cost structure. Our operating margins could suffer if we fail to attract and retain qualified employees, control our labor costs, or recover any increased labor costs through increased prices we charge for our services or otherwise offset such increases with cost savings in other areas.\nFurther, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the spread of COVID-19 caused significant disruptions to worldwide business and market activity. In reaction, many businesses have instituted social distancing policies, including the closure of offices and worksites and deferring planned business activity. Because of the embedded presence of our on-site workforce, if COVID-19 or a similar outbreak of infectious disease were to prevent our workers from being deployed to the applicable work site, it may disrupt our service offerings, interrupt performance on our contracts with clients and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 or a similar outbreak of infectious disease may also lead to further tightening of the labor supply and lead to enhanced wage and benefit packages, as discussed above\nDependence on third-party subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect our profits.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors and equipment manufacturers to complete many of our projects. To the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, or if the amount we are required to pay for these goods or services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price contracts, we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts. In addition, if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services, equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason including, but not limited to, the deterioration of its financial condition, we may be required to purchase the services, equipment or materials from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the expected profit or result in a loss on a project negatively impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees perform services that involve certain risks, including risks of accident, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.\nSafety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Our services can place our employees and others in challenging environments near large equipment, dangerous processes and highly toxic or caustic materials. Operations in our Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services segments involve risks, such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions, and failures, and natural disasters, which could potentially result in releases of CCR materials, injury or death of employees and others, or a need to shut down or reduce operation of our customers\u2019 facilities while remedial actions are undertaken. We are responsible for safety on the sites where we work and these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution\nand other environmental damages, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, and property damage or destruction. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing costs, and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries.\nAlthough we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety, and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts, or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability and the potential loss of customers. If we were to incur substantial liabilities in excess of any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal weather patterns and other factors which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nConsumption of energy is seasonal and any variation from normal weather patterns, including due to unseasonably cooler or warmer weather, can have a significant impact on energy demand. Our financial results may fluctuate seasonally as a result of the seasonal outage maintenance services we provide as part of our nuclear services offerings, along with a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. Additionally, adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and severe cold weather, may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers\u2019 operations, and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.\nOur other service offerings are also subject to quarterly fluctuations from time to time. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenue may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Changes in cost estimates relating to our services, which under percentage-of-completion accounting principles could lead to significant fluctuations in revenue or to changes in the timing of our recognition of revenue from such services, could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may not be able to compete effectively with larger and better-capitalized companies.\nWhile no specific company provides the range of services that we offer, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and require substantial labor and capital resources. Some of the markets in which we compete or plan to compete are served by one or more large, national companies, as well as by regional and local companies of varying sizes and resources, some of which may have accumulated a substantial reputation in their markets. Some of our competitors may also be better capitalized than we are, have greater name recognition than we do, or be able to provide or be willing to bid their services at a lower price than we may be willing to offer. Our inability to compete effectively could hinder our growth or adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on technology in our business, and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe invest in new technology and processes to provide higher-margin offerings for our customers while limiting and managing our environmental risk. We also depend on digital technologies to process and record financial and operating data and we rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. The failure of our technology initiatives and systems to perform as we anticipate or a delay in implementing new technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, within our byproduct sales offerings, which is part of our Environmental Solutions segment, the roll-out of our technology initiatives, including our MP618TM thermal beneficiation technology and our grinding technology, has been slower than previously anticipated, resulting in lower than expected contribution to operating results.\nAdditionally, if competitors implement new technologies before we do, allowing such competitors to provide lower-priced or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, this could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets fully, or if competitors are able to replicate our technology or services, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.\nThough we do not have patents or patent applications relating to many of our key processes and technology, if we are not able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or if our competitors replicate our technology or services, our competitive advantage would be diminished. Further, our competitors may develop or employ comparable technologies or processes.\nIn addition, third parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates intellectual property rights. If we are sued for infringement and lose, we could\nbe required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly regardless of the merits of any claim, is inherently unpredictable, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, irrespective of its outcome.\nAdditionally, we currently license certain third-party intellectual property in connection with our business, and the loss of any such license could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or to integrate acquired businesses successfully, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nWe may from time to time consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other businesses and lines of business that could enhance our technical capabilities, complement our current services, or expand the breadth of our markets. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate the acquired business into our existing operations effectively. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties or liabilities and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms, or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in our liquidity or capital requirements that may vary substantially over time.\nOur operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital, sometimes on short notice and sometimes without assurance of recovery of the expenditures. Environmental liabilities could result in significant cash outflows, including those arising from various customer contracts and acquisition agreements, that require us to indemnify for certain environmental liabilities, litigation risks, unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions, contract initiation or completion delays, political conditions, client payment problems and professional liability claims.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be an event of default under the terms of such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of the amounts owed under such agreements.\nOur debt agreements limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness or contingent obligations;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nincur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make payments to us;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell and pledge assets; and\n\u2022\nacquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants may also impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities, acquire other businesses or lines of business and finance future operations or capital needs in furtherance of our business strategies. Moreover, the form or level of our indebtedness may prevent us from raising additional capital on attractive terms or obtaining additional financing if needed. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the applicable agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default could result in acceleration of the indebtedness owed under such agreement which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If an acceleration occurs, it would likely accelerate all of our indebtedness under all of the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness through cross-default provisions and we would likely be unable to make all of the required payments to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it might not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nOur borrowing levels and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our Revolving Loan, Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan (each, as hereinafter defined).\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $204.6 million, $152.2 million of which relates to our Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loan. At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $19.0 million and letters of credit issued for our account of $12.0 million under our Revolving Loan. We dedicate a portion of our cash flow to debt service. If we do not ultimately have sufficient earnings to service our debt, we would need to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or issue securities, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Loan include customary events of default and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. A breach of our Term Loan and Revolving Loan, including any inability to comply with the required financial ratios, could result in a default. In the event of any default, the lenders thereunder would be entitled to accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Moreover, these lenders would have the option to terminate any obligation to make further extensions of credit under our Revolving Loan. In the event of a default under our Term Loan and Revolving Loan, the lenders thereunder could also proceed to foreclose against the assets securing such obligations. In the event of a foreclosure on all or substantially all of our assets, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern. Outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility would need to be replaced with other forms of collateral. Cross defaults may also occur on other agreements including surety and lease agreements.\nOur indebtedness could have significant consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt, which reduces the cash available for other business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing and creating additional liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more leveraged than our competitors;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to deduct our interest expense;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making additional investments or acquisitions by limiting our aggregate debt obligations.\nTo the extent that we incur new debt in addition to our current debt levels, the leverage risks described above would increase.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") calculation method may change and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") announced that after 2021, it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In the meantime, actions by the FCA, other regulators, or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. Certain of the instruments governing our indebtedness calculate interest with reference to LIBOR. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or disrupt the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.\nThese reforms may also result in new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established, or alternative reference rates to be established. For example, in the U.S., a group convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\") and composed of a diverse set of private sector entities, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or \"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for the U.S. LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun publishing SOFR daily, and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. The potential consequences of these changes cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for LIBOR-linked debt agreements held by us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology systems. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies to process and record financial and operating data and we rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber-security threats. Our technologies, systems, and networks and those of our vendors, suppliers, and other business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Despite our considerable expenditures and efforts to secure our systems, our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As the sophistication of cyber incidents continues to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Additionally, any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber attacks, or other security breaches or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe may, in the normal course of business, be subject to judicial, administrative, or other third-party proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business. In the future, individuals, citizens groups, trade associations, community groups, or environmental activists may bring actions against us in connection with our operations that could interrupt or limit the scope of our business. Many of these proceedings could raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. These proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, or other losses, consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, pursuant to our service agreements, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to our conduct and the services we provide thereunder.\nWith respect to all such proceedings, we have and will when warranted in the future, accrue expenses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). If such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued expenses, or at material amounts, the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our liquidity position.\nWe recognize revenue from construction contracts using the cost-to-cost input method; therefore, variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability.\nWe recognize revenue from construction contracts using the cost-to-cost input method permitted under GAAP, under which we measure the percentage of revenue to be recognized in a given period by the percentage of costs incurred to date on the contract to the total estimated costs for the contract. The cost-to-cost input method therefore, relies on estimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis as the work progresses. Adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of contracts revenue or costs are reflected in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions, judgment and experience, but are subject to the risks inherent in estimates, including unanticipated delays or technical complications. Variances in actual results from related estimates on a large project, or on several smaller projects, could be material to our results of operations. The full amount of an estimated loss on a contract is recognized in the period such a loss is identified. Such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets. A decline in the estimated fair value of a business unit or intangible asset could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our consolidated statement of operations.\nGoodwill, tradenames, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. The fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenue or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to the timing of new awards or other causes. If the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $74.2 million of goodwill and $92.5 million of tradenames, customer relationships and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet, which together represent 47% of our total assets. No impairment\nwas identified in 2019. Changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include the various risks described in this section as well as the following:\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to continue to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates or recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ninternal control failures;\n\u2022\nchanges in management;\n\u2022\navailability of capital;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and pandemics\n\u2022\nlegislation;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and the power generation industry.\nAdditional factors that do not specifically relate to our company or the electric utility industry may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe concentration of our capital stock will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nBernhard Capital Partners Management, LP and its affiliates (\u201cBCP\u201d) own approximately 52% of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), which is convertible at BCP's option at any time following the three-month anniversary of the issuance date into shares of common stock. As a result, BCP has the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over most matters requiring action by our stockholders. The interests of BCP may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. This concentration of ownership also may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nBCP and its respective affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable BCP to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that BCP and its respective affiliates (including portfolio investments of BCP and its affiliates) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022\npermits BCP and its respective affiliates to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if BCP or its respective affiliates, or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of BCP or its respective affiliates who is also one of our directors or officers, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nBCP or its respective affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Furthermore, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, BCP and its respective affiliates may dispose of properties or other assets in the future, without any obligation\nto offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our business or prospects may be negatively affected if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nWe have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and it is likely that we will do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies in the past and it is likely that we will do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be as favorable as may be obtained with a third party.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nafter BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, providing that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum (prior to such time, vacancies may also be filled by stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote);\n\u2022\nafter BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, permitting any action by stockholders to be taken only at an annual meeting or special meeting rather than by a written consent of the stockholders, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock concerning such rights;\n\u2022\nafter BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, permitting our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022\nafter BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, permitting special meetings of our stockholders to be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships (prior to such time, a special meeting may also be called at the request of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote);\n\u2022\nafter BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of all then outstanding common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to remove any or all of the directors from office at any time, and directors will be removable only for \u201ccause\u201d;\n\u2022\ndividing our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of\nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees, agents, or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, employee, or agent of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock, and our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price higher than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you paid for it.\nShares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOn March 16, 2020, we issued $26.0 million in Preferred Stock to BCP, the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nWe currently have 26,000 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, which is convertible at BCP's option at any time following the three-month anniversary of the issuance date into shares of common stock with an initial conversion price of $2.77 per share. Dividends will be payable quarterly basis at a rate of 13% per annum, provided that we pay dividends in-kind through the issuance of additional shares to BCP. Our Preferred Stock gives BCP a superior right to our assets upon liquidation as compared to our common stock and could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, our preferred stock provides BCP the right to nominate one member of the Company's board of directors and the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences assigned to BCP could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. Under these reduced disclosure requirements, emerging growth companies are not required to, among other things, comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation, hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, emerging growth companies have extended phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the extended phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nOur election to use the longer phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the extended phase-in periods under Section 107 of the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company adversely changes his or her recommendation with respect to our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 17916, "SIC": 4950, "TIC": "CHRA"}
