{"cik": "1031203", "company": "GROUP 1 AUTOMOTIVE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nDemand for and pricing of our products and services is subject to economic conditions and other factors, which have had and, in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe automotive retail industry, and especially new vehicle unit sales, is influenced by general economic conditions, particularly consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, interest rates, fuel prices, technology and business model changes, supply conditions, consumer transportation preferences, unemployment rates and credit availability. During economic downturns, such as the recession the U.S. experienced in 2008 and much of 2009, retail new vehicle sales typically experience periods of decline characterized by oversupply and weak demand. In addition, periods of economic uncertainty, as well as volatility in consumer preference around fuel-efficient vehicles in response to volatile fuel prices, and concern about manufacturer viability, may adversely impact future consumer spending and result in a difficult business environment. Any tightening of the credit markets and credit conditions may decrease the availability of automotive loans and leases and adversely impact our new and used vehicle sales and margins. In particular, if sub-prime finance companies apply higher credit standards or if there is a decline in the overall availability of credit in the sub-prime lending market, the ability of consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nVolatile fuel prices may also continue to affect consumer preferences in connection with the purchase of our vehicles. Rising fuel prices may make consumers less likely to purchase larger, more expensive vehicles, such as sports utility vehicles or luxury automobiles, and more likely to purchase smaller, less expensive and more fuel efficient vehicles. Conversely, lower fuel prices could have the opposite effect. Sudden changes in customer preferences make maintenance of an optimal mix of large and small vehicle inventory a challenge. Further increases or sharp declines in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, local economic, competitive and other conditions affect the performance of our dealerships. Our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and spending habits in those regions of the U.S. where we maintain most of our operations. Since a large concentration of our new vehicle sales are in the states of Texas and Oklahoma (43.1%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 which are dependent upon the oil and gas industry, declines in commodity prices have had and future declines could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in those regions.\nWe are subject to a concentration of risk in the event of financial distress, merger, sale or bankruptcy, including potential liquidation, of, or other adverse economic impacts on, certain major vehicle manufacturers.\nToyota, Nissan, Honda, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Daimler, FCA US (formerly Chrysler) and General Motors dealerships represented approximately 97.1% of our total new vehicle retail units sold in 2017. In particular, sales of Toyota/Scion/Lexus new vehicles represented 25.3% of our new vehicle unit sales in 2017. The success of our dealerships is dependent on vehicle manufacturers in several key respects. First, we rely exclusively on the various vehicle manufacturers for our new vehicle inventory. Our ability to sell new vehicles is dependent on a vehicle manufacturer\u2019s ability to produce and allocate to our dealerships an attractive, high quality, and desirable product mix at the right time in order to satisfy customer demand. Second, manufacturers generally support their franchisees by providing direct financial assistance in various areas, including, among others, incentives, floorplan assistance and advertising assistance. A discontinuation or change in our manufacturers\u2019 warranty and incentive programs could adversely affect our business. Third, manufacturers provide product warranties and, in some cases, service contracts to customers. Our dealerships perform warranty and service contract work for vehicles under manufacturer product warranties and service contracts and we bill the manufacturer directly as opposed to invoicing the customer. In addition, we rely on manufacturers to varying extents for original equipment manufactured replacement parts, training, product brochures and point of sale materials, and other items for our dealerships.\nVehicle manufacturers may be adversely impacted by economic downturns or recessions, significant declines in the sales of their new vehicles, increases in interest rates, adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, declines in their credit ratings, reductions in access to capital or credit, labor strikes or similar disruptions (including within their major suppliers), supply shortages, rising raw material costs, rising employee benefit costs, adverse publicity that may reduce consumer demand for their products (including due to bankruptcy), product defects, litigation, ability to keep up with technology and business model changes, poor product mix or unappealing vehicle design, governmental laws and regulations, natural disasters, or other adverse events. These and other risks could materially adversely affect the financial condition of any manufacturer and impact its ability to profitably design, market, produce or distribute new vehicles, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with manufacturers and if we are unable to enter into new franchise agreements in connection with dealership acquisitions or maintain or renew our existing franchise agreements on favorable terms, our operations may be significantly impaired.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with manufacturers, which exercise a great degree of influence over our operations through the franchise agreements. For example, delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, manufacturer approvals and franchise agreements for dealership acquisitions could adversely affect our acquisition program. In determining whether to approve an acquisition, manufacturers may consider many factors, including the moral character and business experience of the dealership principals, the financial condition, and ownership structure, as well as Customer Satisfaction Index scores, sales efficiency, and other performance measures of our other dealerships. Manufacturers may use these performance indicators, as well as sales performance numbers, as conditions for certain payments and as factors in evaluating applications for additional acquisitions. In unusual cases where performance indicators, such as the ones described above, are not met to the satisfaction of the manufacturer, certain manufacturers may either limit our ability to acquire additional dealerships or require the disposal of existing dealerships or both. From time to time, we have not met all of the manufacturers\u2019 requirements to make acquisitions and have received requests to dispose of certain of our dealerships. In the event one or more of our manufacturers sought to prohibit future acquisitions, or imposed requirements to dispose of one or more of our dealerships, our acquisition and growth strategy could be adversely affected.\nA manufacturer may also limit the number of its dealerships that we may own or the number that we may own in a particular geographic area. For example, in the U.S., we may acquire only six primary Lexus dealerships or six outlets nationally. As of December 31, 2017, we owned three primary Lexus dealerships.\nIn addition, each of our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by the manufacturer for a variety of reasons, including any unapproved changes of ownership or management, sales and customer satisfaction performance deficiencies and other material breaches of the franchise agreements. Manufacturers may also have a right of first refusal if we seek to sell dealerships. We cannot guarantee all of our franchise agreements will be renewed or that the terms of the renewals will be as favorable to us as our current agreements. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our manufacturers will not attempt to terminate our franchise agreements if they perceive that performance deficiencies exist. If such an instance occurs, although we are generally protected by automotive dealership franchise laws requiring \u201cgood cause\u201d be shown for such termination, we cannot guarantee that the termination of the franchise will not be successful. Actions taken by manufacturers to exploit their bargaining position in negotiating the terms of renewals of franchise agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, the terms of certain of our real estate-related indebtedness require the repayment of all amounts outstanding in the event that the associated franchise is terminated. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our franchise rights become compromised or our operations restricted due to the terms of our franchise agreements or if we lose substantial franchises.\nFinally, our franchise agreements do not give us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer\u2019s product within a given geographic area. Subject to state laws in the U.S. that are generally designed to protect dealers, a manufacturer may grant another dealer a franchise to start a new dealership near one of our locations, or an existing dealership may move its dealership to a location that would more directly compete against us. The location of new dealerships near our existing dealerships could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and reduce the profitability of our existing dealerships.\nOur inability to acquire new dealerships and successfully integrate those dealerships into our business could adversely affect the growth of our revenues and earnings.\nGrowth in our revenues and earnings partially depends on our ability to acquire new dealerships and successfully integrate those dealerships into our existing operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire dealerships in the future. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any acquisitions will be successful or on terms and conditions consistent with past acquisitions. Restrictions by our manufacturers, as well as covenants contained in our debt instruments, may directly or indirectly limit our ability to acquire additional dealerships. In addition, increased competition for acquisitions may develop, which could result in fewer acquisition opportunities available to us and/or higher acquisition prices. And, some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us.\nWe will continue to need substantial capital in order to acquire additional automobile dealerships. We currently intend to finance future acquisitions by using cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Acquisition Line, proceeds from debt and/or equity offerings and/or issuing shares of our common stock as partial consideration for acquired dealerships. Access to funding through the debt or equity capital markets could become challenging in the future. Also, in the future, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets could increase if lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms similar to current debt or at all, and reduce or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Accordingly, our ability to complete acquisitions could be adversely affected if the price of our common stock is depressed or if our access to capital is limited.\nIn addition, managing and integrating additional dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs, diversion of our management\u2019s attention, delays, or other operational or financial problems. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nincurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u2022\nfailing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships;\n\u2022\nentering new markets with which we are not familiar;\n\u2022\nincurring undiscovered liabilities at acquired dealerships, generally, in the case of stock acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nfailing to retain key personnel of the acquired dealerships;\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with employees, manufacturers and customers; and\n\u2022\nincorrectly valuing acquired entities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating condition of the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these acquired businesses.\nWe are subject to substantial regulations, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA number of state and federal laws and regulations applicable to automotive companies affect our business. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to business corporations generally. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations. In every jurisdiction in which we operate, we must obtain various licenses in order to operate our businesses, including dealer, sales, finance and insurance-related licenses issued by government authorities. These laws also regulate our conduct of business, including our advertising, operating, financing, employment and sales practices. Other laws and regulations include state franchise laws and regulations in the U.S., anti-trust laws and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers, as well as U.S. federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws. Though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers\u2019 lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of U.S. franchise laws. If U.S. franchise laws are repealed in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or showing of good cause. Without the protection of U.S. franchise laws, it may also be more difficult for us to renew our franchise agreements upon expiration. Further, U.S. federal law, including any federal bankruptcy law, may preempt state law in the U.S. and allow manufacturers greater freedom to terminate or not renew franchises. Furthermore, some states have initiated consumer \u201cbill of rights\u201d statutes which involve increases in our costs associated with the sale of vehicles, or decreases in some of our profit centers.\nA substantial amount of our business is related to the real estate we own or lease to conduct our various automotive operations. Often times, the success of such automotive operations is dependent upon our ability to locate, and purchase or lease suitable real estate on favorable terms. We are highly dependent upon the availability of real estate in each of our automotive markets. Additionally, real estate we are interested in acquiring will be subject to local municipal laws of county, township, parish and other local municipalities that often times will govern what type of real estate we can purchase for our various automotive operations. Local ordinances, deed restrictions, zoning and other land use restrictions may prohibit the type of business permitted on a given leased or purchased property which can add to the challenge of locating appropriate real estate. The costs and length of time associated with changing the permitted use of a leased or purchased property may affect our ability to enter a market or expand our operations in an existing market. Our inability to locate, and lease or purchase additional suitable properties to meet the needs of our various automotive operations in multiple markets would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financing activities with customers are subject to U.S. federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, insurance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws and regulations. Some states in the U.S. regulate finance fees and charges that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or our dealerships by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines.\nOur operations are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, the Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. The imported automobiles we purchase are subject to U.S. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business, we may, from time to time, be subject to claims for duties, penalties, liquidated damages, or other charges.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to consumer protection laws known as Lemon Laws. These laws typically require a manufacturer or dealer to replace a new vehicle or accept it for a full refund within one year after initial purchase if the\nvehicle does not conform to the manufacturer\u2019s express warranties and the dealer or manufacturer, after a reasonable number of attempts, is unable to correct or repair the defect. Federal laws require various written disclosures to be provided on new vehicles, including mileage and pricing information.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law and established the CFPB with broad regulatory powers in the U.S. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded from the CFPB\u2019s regulatory authority, we are required to comply with regulations applicable to privacy notices, and the CFPB acted to regulate automotive financing activities through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions that service the automotive industry. The CFPB has issued regulatory guidance instructing financial institutions to monitor dealer loans for potential discrimination resulting from the system used to compensate dealers for assisting in the customer financing transaction. The CFPB has instructed lenders that, if discrimination is found, the lender would be required to change dealer compensation practices. If this initiative substantially restricts our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers for the purchase of vehicles, the result could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of derivative markets and entities, such as us, that participate in those markets. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and exchange trading. To the extent we engage in such transactions that are or become subject to such rules in the future, we will be required to comply or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and banking regulators established margin rules for uncleared swaps. Although we believe that we qualify for the end-user exceptions to the mandatory clearing and margin requirements with respect to swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, clearing our transactions or posting of initial or variation margin could impact our liquidity and reduce cash available for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivative contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distributions to our shareholders.\nOn June 23, 2016, the British Citizens voted on a referendum in favor of exiting the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The majority vote in favor of Brexit has created uncertainty in the regulatory environment in the U.K. To date, there has been no clear indication of how the Brexit vote will ultimately effect our U.K. sales, but if legislation related to Brexit results in a material reduction of sales in our U.K. dealerships, such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and business operations.\nOn April 14, 2016, the EU Parliament approved the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which organizations must start complying with by May 25, 2018. GDPR regulations will replace the UK Data Protection Act of 1998 for organizations doing business in the UK. The GDPR will apply in all EU member states from 25 May 2018. Because GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, the UK does not need to draw up new legislation - instead, it will apply automatically. The GDPR was designed to align data privacy laws across Europe, protect all EU citizens\u2019 data by restricting third parties uses of such data without such individual\u2019s permission, and change the way organizations approach the protection of data and preserving citizen\u2019s privacy. Unlike previous EU data privacy regulations, the GDPR applies to all organizations storing or processing the data of EU citizens, regardless of the location of the company. It provides for strict rules and requirements for EU and non-EU organizations, including requiring organizations to report data breaches within 72 hours and to conduct impact assessments to identify vulnerabilities. Moreover, the GDPR applies a tiered penalty approach, which provides for heavy fines. If an organization seriously infringes the GDPR, the organization can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is greater. Any future failure by us to comply with the GDPR could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur U.K. finance operations also arrange for the sale of various contracts for products and services in connection with the sale of new and used vehicles. Those activities in the U.K. are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA is an independent watchdog that regulates financial services of our dealerships. The FCA was created in the wake of the financial crisis as a result of passage of the Financial Services Act of 2012 (the \u201cFSA Act\u201d). The FSA Act sets out a system for regulating financial services in order to protect and improve the U.K.\u2019s economy. Its purpose was to make sure markets work well by confirming that financial services maintain and ensure the integrity of the markets, regulate financial services firms so that they give consumers a fair deal and ensure the financial services market is competitive.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, has and may continue to increase our annual employee health care costs that we fund. We cannot predict the extent of the effect that this statute, or any future state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation, will have on us. However, any additional expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry could result in significant long-term costs to us, which could in turn adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPossible penalties for violation of any of these laws or regulations include revocation or suspension of our licenses and/or civil or criminal fines and penalties. In addition, many laws may give customers a private cause of action. Violation of these laws, the cost of compliance with these laws, or changes in these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nIn the course of our operations in the United States, United Kingdom and Brazil, we generate, handle, store and recycle or dispose of various used products and wastes. These business activities are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws, regulations and other controls governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws, regulations and controls may impose numerous obligations upon our operations including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the imposition of restrictions on where or how to manage or dispose of used products and wastes, the incurrence of capital expenditures to limit or prevent releases of such material, and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory remedial and corrective action obligations or increase of capital expenditures, delays in permitting or in the performance of projects and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations in affected areas.\nThere is a risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the operations of our automotive dealerships due to our handling of regulated used products and wastes, because of releases arising in the course of our operations, including from storage tanks and in-ground lifts, and due to contamination arising from historical operations and waste disposal practices, including by predecessor operators or owners over whom we had no control or supervision. We could be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly requirements with respect to pollution control equipment, waste management and disposal activities, or increased fuel economy and reduced vehicle emmissions for light-duty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. For instance, in the United States, vehicle manufacturers are subject to federal regulations requiring GHG reduction and CAFE standards for light-duty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2021. Under these regulations, most manufacturers are required to modify their vehicle platforms and powertrains to achieve a fleet-wide average fuel efficiency equivalent of 44.7 miles per gallon by model year 2021. The EPA and NHTSA commenced mid-term reviews in 2017 to determine the technological progress and economic implications for extending these standards to model years 2022-2025. While the EPA had previously committed in 2012 to continuing to coordinate development of its GHG emission standards with NHTSA\u2019s development of CAFE standards for light-duty vehicles, it did not do so in the development and publication of the EPA\u2019s January 2017 Midterm Evaluation of standards, which resulted in the EPA signing a final determination to maintain the current GHG emissions standards for model year 2022-2025 vehicles. However, in March 2017, the EPA and NHTSA published a notice of intent in which the EPA announced its intention to reconsider its final determination with respect to GHG emissions standards and agreed to coordinate its reconsideration with the parallel process being undertaken by the NHTSA regarding CAFE standards. In August 2017, the EPA published a request for public comment on its proposed plans to reconsider whether the previously established GHG emissions standards for light-duty vehicles are appropriate under the Clean Air Act. In connection with its review of the CAFE standards, the NHTSA published a notice of intent in July 2017 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the model year 2022-2025 light-duty vehicles CAFE standards to assess the potential environmental impact of those standards.\nWhereas the CAFE standards are designed to improve vehicle fuel economy in the United States, the GHG standards are based on determinations made by the EPA that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Congress and numerous states have from time to time considered and - in the case of some states, adopted - legislation to restrict GHG. These laws generally take the form of cap and trade programs, requiring large sources of GHG emissions to purchase allowances or take steps to reduce emissions to comply with the cap. Climate-change legal requirements are also being considered on an international level. For example, in December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations, at that time, in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to review and establish goals for limiting GHG emissions. This Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil in April 2016 and the agreement entered into force in November 2016. However, this agreement did not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions but, rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. As another example, the U.K. government announced in July 2017 that it would ban the sale of new petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles beginning in 2040. In addition, beginning 2020, new pollution taxes will be levied on diesel drivers who use certain congested highways. The adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of the GHGs on vehicles and automotive fuels in the U.S., the U.K. or Brazil could adversely affect prices of and demand for the vehicles we sell, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. The trend in environmental regulation is to often place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly requirements with respect to pollution control equipment, waste management and disposal activities, or increased fuel economy and reduced vehicle emissions for light-duty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nPlease see \u201cItem 1. Business - Governmental Regulations - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations\u201d for more information.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel, our business could be adversely affected because we rely on the industry knowledge and relationships of our key personnel.\nWe believe our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, senior management and key employees, including our regional vice presidents. The unexpected or unanticipated loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business and impair the efficiency and productivity of our operations. We do not have key man insurance for any of our executive officers or key personnel. In addition, the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate, particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel, is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment. We do not have employment agreements with our dealership general managers and other key dealership personnel. Accordingly, the inability to retain key employees or the failure to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business and may impact the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with our standards.\nSubstantial competition in automotive sales and services may materially and adversely affect our results of operations due to our need to lower prices to sustain sales.\nThe automotive retail industry is highly competitive. Depending on the geographic market, we compete with:\n\u2022\nfranchised automotive dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar makes of new and used vehicles that we offer, occasionally at lower prices than we do;\n\u2022\nother national or regional affiliated groups of franchised dealerships and/or of used vehicle dealerships;\n\u2022\nprivate market buyers and sellers of used vehicles;\n\u2022\ninternet-based vehicle brokers that sell vehicles obtained from franchised dealers directly to consumers;\n\u2022\nauto parts retailers;\n\u2022\nlocal, regional and national collision centers;\n\u2022\nservice center chain stores; and\n\u2022\nindependent service and repair shops.\nWe do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from vehicle manufacturers and typically rely on advertising, merchandising, sales expertise, service reputation, product demand and dealership location in order to sell new vehicles. Our franchise agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer\u2019s product within a given geographic area. If competing dealerships expand their market share or are awarded additional franchises by manufacturers it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to competition for vehicle sales, our dealerships compete with franchised dealerships to perform warranty maintenance and repair services and with other automotive dealers, franchised and independent service center chains and independent garages for non-warranty repair and routine maintenance business. Our parts operations compete with other automotive dealers, service stores and auto parts retailers. We believe the principal competitive factors in the parts and service business are the quality of customer service, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, familiarity with a manufacturer\u2019s brands and models, convenience, access to and use of technology required for certain repairs and services, location, price, the competence of technicians and the availability of training programs to enhance such expertise. A number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our dealerships\u2019 prices. We also compete with a broad range of financial institutions in arranging financing for our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases.\nThe internet has also become a significant part of the advertising and sales process in our industry. Customers are using the internet as part of the sales process to compare pricing for cars and related finance and insurance services, which may reduce gross profit margins for new and used cars and profits for related finance and insurance services. Some retailers offer vehicles for sale over internet websites without the benefit of having a dealership franchise, although they must currently source their vehicles from a franchised dealer. One or more companies are currently manufacturing electric vehicles for sale solely through the internet without using the traditional dealer-network, and circumventing the state franchise laws of several states in the United States. If those companies are successful in selling their vehicles without the requirements of establishing a dealer-network, they may be able to have a competitive advantage over the traditional dealers, which could adversely affect our sales in those states. If internet new vehicle sales are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers, or if dealerships are able to effectively use the internet to sell outside of their markets, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our business would also be materially adversely affected to the extent that internet companies acquire dealerships or align themselves with our competitors\u2019 dealerships.\nPlease see \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d for more discussion of competition in our industry.\nA cybersecurity breach, including a breach of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about our customers or employees, could negatively affect operations and result in high costs.\nThere has been a substantial increase in attempts by third parties with bad intentions to steal data from numerous businesses world-wide, including our dealerships, by highly sophisticated means. If a third party is successful in obtaining such confidential information of our dealerships or our customers or disrupting our operations through high-tech security breaches and hacking methods, we could have substantial liability in connection with such security breaches. While we attempt to implement state of the art technological defenses to thwart such activities, there is no guaranty that we will be able to keep up with the ever evolving sophisticated methods of breaching security systems and continue to combat such attempts to breach our own data systems. Failure to do so could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and our data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across business units. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their PII from cyber-attack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or our data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our business affiliates receive significant PII about our customers in order to complete the sale or service of a vehicle and related products. We also receive PII from our employees. Numerous state and federal regulations in the U.S., as well as payment card industry and other vendor standards, govern the collection and maintenance of PII from consumers and other individuals. Although many companies across many industries are affected by malicious efforts to obtain access to PII, news reports suggest that the automotive dealership industry is a particular target of identity thieves. Moreover, there are numerous opportunities for a data security breach, including cyber-security breaches, burglary, lost or misplaced data, scams, or misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. We have spent to date, and will continue to spend, significant resources to combat and protect against cyber-attacks and other forms of security breaches. Despite the security measures we have in place and any additional measures we may implement or adopt in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, scams, burglary, human errors, acts of vandalism, or other events. Alleged or actual data security breaches can increase costs of doing business, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to negative publicity, individual claims or consumer class actions,\nadministrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business is sensitive to manufacturer recalls, and the effects such recalls have on the reputation of our manufacturers.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer demand and brand preferences of our manufacturer\u2019s products. Manufacturer recall campaigns are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope over the last several years. Manufacturer recall campaigns could adversely affect our new and used vehicle sales or customer residual trade-in valuations, could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from our inventory available for sale, could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nThe impairment of our goodwill, our indefinite-lived intangibles and our other long-lived assets has had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We assess the carrying value of our long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.\nBased on the organization and management of our business, we determined that each of our regions represents a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment. In evaluating goodwill, we compare the carrying value of our reporting units to their respective fair values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units we use a combination of the discounted cash flow and market approaches. In addition, we evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived, intangible franchise rights at a dealership level using a discounted cash flow based approach. Both these analyses are based upon a series of assumptions. See Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates - Goodwill\u201d and \u201cIntangible Franchise Rights\u201d for additional information regarding the assumptions that underlie our analysis.\nPerformance issues at individual dealerships, as well as broader economic and retail automotive industry trends can result in changes to the assumptions in our fair value estimates. In addition, until the full effect of our business practices, scale leverage and other cost savings initiatives can be realized, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles associated with an acquisition are generally more subject to impairment in the years immediately following the acquisition. For example, the decline in the Brazilian economy and retail auto industry since our acquisition of the Brazil dealerships in March 2013 adversely impacted the results of the impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, in our fourth quarter 2015 impairment analysis, we determined that there had been material changes to the previous assumptions underlying the amount of goodwill and/or intangible assets associated with our Brazilian dealerships, and we wrote down the value of those assets, which resulted in a material non-cash impairment charge.\nOn June 23, 2016, the British Citizens voted on a referendum in favor of exiting the EU. The majority vote in favor of Brexit has created uncertainty in the global markets and in the regulatory environment in the U.K., as well as the overall European Union. The impact on our financial results and operations may not be known for some time, but could be adverse. In addition, automotive dealers in the U.K. rely on the legislative doctrine of \"Block Exemption\" to govern market representation activities of competing dealers and dealer groups. To date, there continues to be no clear indication of how such legislation may be effected by Brexit, but a change to such legislation could be adverse. If, as a result of the clarification of any of these uncertainties, the estimates, assumptions and inputs utilized in our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible franchise rights change or fail to materialize, the resulting decline in the estimated fair market value of such assets could result in a material non-cash impairment charge. While we are not aware of any changes in circumstances that have resulted in a decline in fair value of these assets at this time, we continue to closely monitor the situation.\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. To test the carrying value of assets to be sold, we generally use independent, third-party appraisals or pending transactions as an estimate of fair value. In the event of an adverse change in the real estate market, the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material non-cash impairment charge to the associated long-lived assets.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nBorrowings under our credit facilities and various other notes payable bear interest based on a floating rate. Therefore, our interest expense would increase with any rise in interest rates. A rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business, particularly new and used vehicle sales, because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases. As a result, a rise in interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues. To mitigate the impact, we have entered into derivative transactions to convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to fixed rates to partially mitigate this risk. In addition, we receive interest assistance from certain automobile manufacturers, which is reflected as a reduction in cost of sales on our statements\nof operations. Please see Part II, \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for a discussion regarding our interest rate sensitivity.\nNatural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business.\nSome of our dealerships are concentrated in states and regions in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil in which actual or threatened natural disasters and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, snow storms, flooding, and hail storms) have in the past, and may in the future, disrupt our dealership operations. A disruption in our operations may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to business interruption, the automotive retailing business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property value at dealership locations. Natural disasters and severe weather events have in the past and may in the future impair the value of our dealership property. Although we have, subject to certain limitations and exclusions, substantial insurance, including business interruption insurance, we may be exposed to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance does not fully cover all of our operational risks, and changes in the cost of insurance or the availability of insurance could materially increase our insurance costs or result in a decrease in our insurance coverage.\nThe operation of automobile dealerships is subject to compliance with a wide range of laws and regulations and is subject to a broad variety of risks. While we have insurance on our real property, comprehensive coverage for our vehicle inventory, general liability insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, employee dishonesty coverage, employment practices liability insurance, pollution coverage and errors and omissions insurance in connection with vehicle sales and financing activities, we are self-insured for a portion of our potential liabilities. We purchase insurance policies for worker\u2019s compensation, liability, auto physical damage, property, pollution, employee medical benefits and other risks consisting of large deductibles and/or self-insured retentions.\nIn certain instances, our insurance may not fully cover an insured loss depending on the magnitude and nature of the claim. Additionally, changes in the cost of insurance or the availability of insurance in the future could substantially increase our costs to maintain our current level of coverage or could cause us to reduce our insurance coverage and increase the portion of our risks that we self-insure.\nVehicle technology advancements and ownership model changes.\nWith the advancement in the technology of semi and fully autonomous electric-powered vehicles, several new business models are in early stage development to create high mileage, self-driving and/or co-ownership vehicle opportunities. These autonomous-electric vehicles may be manufactured by existing automotive manufacturers or other companies who do not presently manufacture hydrocarbon or alternative fuel source vehicles. Even with the current highway and road infrastructure challenges and the large number of existing internal combustion engines currently in service and to be in service for many years to come, which will create obstacles to the wide-spread implementation of such autonomous-electric vehicles in the immediate future, many in the automotive industry believe that it will only be a matter of time until such vehicles will be available to the automotive consumer at low usage costs. Such industry participants believe projected low usage costs of autonomous-electric vehicles may entice many vehicle owners, particularly in larger, highly populated areas, to abandon individual car ownership in favor of multiple co-ownership ride-sharing opportunities. If such autonomous-electric vehicles can be mass produced at a reasonable production and operating cost and sold by companies not required to conduct their business in accordance with state franchise laws and thereby circumvent the current dealer-network, and/or if the ride-sharing subscription business model becomes widely popular, such events could adversely affect industry new and used vehicle sales volumes and the growth of our earnings and revenues.\nAdditionally, with the anticipated demand by consumers for electric-powered vehicles, our manufacturers must adapt their physical plants accordingly to meet the demands of consumers for electric vehicles for years to come. As more and more electric vehicles enter the market, and more and more combustible engines exit the market, our ability to adapt to such changes, particularly in regards to our ability to manage our inventory, will be necessary to meet the current consumer demands and maintain the current profitability at our dealerships. Furthermore, while in the short term we do not believe there will be a significant difference in maintenance costs incurred by a vehicle owner of a combustible engine versus maintenance costs of a vehicle owner of a new electric-powered vehicle that may not be the case as technology advancements are made in the development of electric-powered vehicles. If such maintenance costs by a consumer of an electric-powered vehicle were to substantially decrease, that could have a material adverse effect on our parts and service revenues.\nOur indebtedness and the associated covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing, including for acquisitions and capital expenditures, limit our flexibility to manage our business, prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations and restrict our use of capital.\nOur indebtedness could impact us, in the following ways:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\na portion of our current cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nsome of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increasing interest rates;\n\u2022\nwe may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changing market conditions and regulations; and\n\u2022\nduring periods of economic downturn, we may be more susceptible to a breach of our debt covenants and default on our indebtedness.\nOur debt instruments contain numerous covenants that limit our discretion with respect to business matters, including mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, international investments, incurring additional debt or disposing of assets. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement or indenture. In addition, a default under one agreement or indenture could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under the other agreements or indentures under the cross default provisions in those agreements or indentures. If a default or cross default were to occur, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of our indebtedness, which would likely be on less favorable terms than our current terms and cause us to incur additional fees to process. Alternatively, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. As a result of this risk, we could be forced to take actions that we otherwise would not take, or not take actions that we otherwise might take, in order to comply with the covenants in these agreements and indentures.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our non-U.S. operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOver the past several years, we have significantly increased our operations outside the U.S. market. Expanding our operations in the U.K. and Brazil are important elements of our growth strategy. Operations outside of the U.S. are subject to various risks which may not be present or as significant for operations within U.S. markets, and our exposure to these risks increases as we expand. Government actions, both in terms of policy-setting, as well as actions directly affecting our operations, and economic uncertainty in some geographic regions in which we operate, such as emerging markets, could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows in those areas.\nRisks inherent in our international operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nwage inflation in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nsocial plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;\n\u2022\nincreases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains or regional terms of business;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nexposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nvariations in protection of legal rights;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and other laws and regulations creating tax inefficiencies and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of corruption;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022\nmore expansive legal rights of foreign labor unions;\n\u2022\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises;\n\u2022\nexposure to local public health concerns and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ntransparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1974, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues;\n\u2022\nunsettled social and political conditions, in general, and possible terrorist attacks, drug cartel related violence or acts of war, civil unrest, expansion of hostilities and other political risks; and\n\u2022\nlack of franchise protection, which creates greater competition.\nThe likelihood of these occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, therefore, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which may become more pronounced as we expand our international presence.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements reflect that our results of operations and financial position are reported in local currency and are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency rate. Fluctuations in such currency rates may have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position as reported in U.S. dollars. Management evaluates the Company\u2019s results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. See Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information on constant currency basis. See Part II, \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\u201d for additional information on foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their personnel and intermediaries from offering, authorizing, or making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or securing some improper advantage in business or engaging in conduct\ninvolving money-laundering. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary. Our personnel and intermediaries may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws to which we may be subject. Existing compliance safeguards and any future improvements may not prevent all such conduct, and it is possible that our employees and intermediaries may engage in conduct for which we might be investigated by U.S. and other authorities, and held responsible. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and other anticorruption laws (either due to our acts or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur growth in emerging markets, such as Brazil, is subject to special risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn February 2013, we acquired UAB Motors Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (\u201cUAB Motors\u201d), which allowed us to enter the Brazilian market. At the time we entered the Brazilian market, it was an emerging growth market. Since then, Brazil experienced a significant economic downturn and has been in the midst of a recession. Partially as a result, Brazil represented less than 5% of our total new vehicle retail units sold during the year ended December 31, 2017. Since February 2013, Brazil has also experienced significant currency fluctuations. And, while recent data is beginning to show signs of a recovery, there is no assurance that our future growth strategies in Brazil will be successful or that Brazil\u2019s economy will continue its recovery. If the Brazil financial recovery is longer than expected, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201cWe are subject to risks associated with our non-U.S. operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d Further, our growth in emerging markets by acquisition of existing dealerships, such as our acquisition of UAB Motors, is subject to additional risk as discussed under \u201cOur ability to acquire new dealerships and successfully integrate those dealerships into our business could adversely affect the growth of our revenues and earnings\u201d above.\nCertain restrictions relating to our management and ownership of our common stock could deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and adversely affect our ability to engage in equity offerings.\nAs a condition to granting their consent to our previous acquisitions and our initial public offering, some of our manufacturers have imposed other restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe removal of a non-employee director from office only for cause;\n\u2022\nany one person or entity, who in the opinion of the manufacturer is unqualified to own its franchised dealership or has interests incompatible with the manufacturer, from acquiring more than a specified percentage of our common stock (ranging from 20% to 50% depending on the particular manufacturer\u2019s restrictions) and this trigger level can fall to as low as 5% if another vehicle manufacturer is the entity acquiring the ownership interest or voting rights;\n\u2022\ncertain material changes in our business or extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of a material amount of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe removal of a dealership general manager without the consent of the manufacturer; and\n\u2022\na change in control of our Board of Directors or a change in management.\nOur manufacturers may also impose additional similar restrictions on us in the future. Actions by our stockholders or prospective stockholders, which would violate any of the above restrictions, are generally outside our control. If we are unable to comply with or renegotiate these restrictions, we may be forced to terminate or sell one or more franchises, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These restrictions may prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and, therefore, may adversely impact the value of our common stock. These restrictions also may impede our ability to acquire dealership groups, to raise required capital or to issue our stock as consideration for future acquisitions.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and franchise agreements contain provisions that make a takeover of us difficult.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nallowing only the Board of Directors to set the number of non-employee directors;\n\u2022\nrequiring super-majority or class voting to affect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimiting the persons who may call special stockholders\u2019 meetings;\n\u2022\nlimiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the designation, number, voting powers, preferences, and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock and prevent a change of our control.\nFinally, certain of our franchise agreements prohibit the acquisition of more than a specified percentage of our common stock without the consent of the relevant manufacturer. These terms of our franchise agreements could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us.", "PERMNO": 85427, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "GPI"}
