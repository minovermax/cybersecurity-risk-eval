You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the SEC before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $38.0 million, consisting of $18.3 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our short-term debt obligations and $19.7 million in long-term related party borrowings. On February 27, 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (as co-borrowers or guarantors) entered into that certain Revolving Credit, Term Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement and that certain Export-Import Revolving Credit, Guaranty and Security Agreement, in each case with PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC Bank\u201d) and Citibank, N.A. as lenders, and PNC as agent for the lenders. We refer to such transactions and the agreements referenced above as the \u201cPNC Credit Facilities\u201d. On March 5, 2020, DASAN Network Solutions, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Korea, and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cDNS Korea\u201d) entered into a Loan Agreement with DNI, pursuant to which DNS Korea borrowed KRW 22.4 billion ($18.5 million USD) from DNI (the \u201cMarch 2020 DNI Loan\u201d). DNS Korea will fully loan such borrowed funds to the Company, which will be used to repay and terminate the PNC Credit Facilities. See \u201cPart II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn the event of a default and acceleration of our obligations under the March 2020 DNI Loan, we may not be able to obtain replacement financing at all or on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences and could materially and adversely affect us in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or market conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to use a significant portion of any future cash flow from operations to repay or service the debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and increases in interest rates.\nThe agreements governing the March 2020 DNI Loan and the instruments governing our other indebtedness contain certain covenants, limitations, and conditions with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, including financial reporting obligations and customary events of default and require that certain of our assets be pledged as collateral for such loans. These terms, conditions and collateral requirements could restrict our ability to operate our business. If an event of default occurs under the March 2020 DNI Loan, DNI will be entitled to take various actions, including requiring the immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts borrowed under the March 2020 DNI Loan and seizing and/or selling the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors to satisfy the obligations under the March 2020 DNI Loan.\nIn the past, we have violated certain financial covenants in our credit agreements and received waivers for these violations. At September 30, 2019, the Company was not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant under the PNC Credit Facilities, which represented an event of default thereunder. On November 8, 2019, the Company obtained a waiver of the foregoing event of default. As a condition for the issuance of the waiver, the Company voluntarily prepaid $10.0 million of the outstanding term loan and paid a one-time fee of $150,000. The Company would have been in further breach of this financial covenant as of December 31, 2019. The Company and DNS Korea entered into the March 2020 DNI Loan in part to repay and terminate the PNC Credit Facilities. While the Company believes the covenants in the March 2020 DNI Loan are more favorable than the covenants contained in the PNC Credit Facilities, there remains uncertainty as to whether DNS Korea will be able to satisfy some of the covenants included in the March 2020 DNI Loan. If the Company violates covenants in the March 2020 DNI Loan, the Company could be required to repay the amounts then outstanding under the March 2020 DNI Loan.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, purchase credit insurance or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to engage in any of these actions on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available.\nWe need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations and may require additional financing in the future to expand our business, acquire assets or repay or refinance our existing debt. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Additionally, while there are no covenants in the March 2020 DNI Loan restricting our ability, or the ability of our subsidiaries, to borrow additional funds, the collateral requirements under the March 2020 DNI Loan may make it difficult to for us to obtain additional secured financing. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintain existing operations;\n\u2022\npay ordinary expenses;\n\u2022\nfund our business expansion or product innovation;\n\u2022\npursue future business opportunities, including acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrespond to unanticipated capital requirements;\n\u2022\nrepay or refinance our existing debt;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. In addition, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions that we have previously taken, and reduce operations in low margin regions, including reductions in headcount, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may not have the liquidity to support our future operations and capital requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $28.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $14.2 million in cash balances held by our international subsidiaries. If our operating performance does not improve, and we are unable to raise additional capital (as discussed in the prior risk factor), we may be unable to adequately fund our existing operations. Our current liquidity condition exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nvulnerability to adverse economic conditions in our industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of available cash is dedicated to debt servicing, rather than other purposes, including operations and new product innovation;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to adequately plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nnegative investor and customer perceptions about our financial stability, which could limit our ability to obtain financing or acquire customers.\nOur current liquidity condition could be further harmed, and we may incur significant losses or expend significant amounts of capital if:\n\u2022\nthe market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe fail to establish market share or generate revenue at anticipated levels;\n\u2022\nour capital expenditure forecasts change or prove to be inaccurate; or\n\u2022\nwe fail to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.\nTo meet our liquidity needs and to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business, we may be required to raise substantial additional capital, reduce our operations (including through the sale of assets) or both.\nWe have experienced significant losses and we may incur losses in the future. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability, our stock price could decline.\nWe had a net loss of $13.3 million and net income of $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, we have incurred significant losses in prior years. We have an accumulated deficit of $29.2 million as of December 31, 2019. We have significant fixed expenses and expect that we will continue to incur substantial manufacturing, research and product development, sales and marketing, customer support, administrative and other expenses in connection with the ongoing development of our business. In addition, we may be required to spend more on research and product development than originally budgeted to respond to industry trends. We may also incur significant new costs related to acquisitions and the integration of new technologies and other acquisitions that may occur in the future. We may not be able to adequately manage costs and expenses or achieve or maintain adequate operating margins. As a result, our ability to sustain profitability in future periods will depend on our ability to generate and sustain higher revenue while maintaining reasonable costs and expense levels. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability in future periods, we may continue to incur operating losses, which could be substantial, and our stock price could decline.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and our stock price may continue to be volatile.\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The primary factors that could affect our results of operations include the following:\n\u2022\ncommercial acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for network access products;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in gross margin;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain qualified and key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of orders from customers;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to finance their purchase of our products as well as their own operations;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions, enhancements or announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our company and our contract manufacturers to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components;\n\u2022\nincreases in the prices of the components we purchase, or quality problems associated with these components;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in regulatory requirements which may require us to redesign portions of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules;\n\u2022\nintegrating and operating any acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve targeted cost reductions;\n\u2022\nhow well we execute on our strategy and operating plans; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications, internet and related industries.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity that could adversely affect our stock price. We anticipate that our stock price and trading volume may continue to be volatile in the future, whether due to the factors described above, volatility in public stock markets generally (particularly in the technology sector) or otherwise.\nIn connection with the Keymile Acquisition, we assumed certain of Keymile\u2019s liabilities, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nPursuant to the definitive agreement for the Keymile Acquisition, we assumed certain of Keymile\u2019s liabilities, including tax and pension liabilities, and any liabilities that may arise related to breaches of representations and warranties made by Keymile in connection with a prior sale of assets by Keymile that survive through 2022. Although the definitive agreement for the Keymile Acquisition entitles us to indemnification for certain losses incurred related to those assumed liabilities, our right to indemnification from the Keymile sellers is limited by the survival period of the representations and warranties included in the Keymile Acquisition definitive agreement and recovery is limited in amount to the purchase price of Keymile, or EUR 10.3 million. Additionally, our rights to recovery against such losses is limited under our and third party provided warranty and indemnity liability insurance coverage of up to EUR 35.3 million. If such claims or losses exceed such amount, or if they are not indemnifiable under the Keymile Acquisition definitive agreement, any such losses could negatively impact our financial situation. In addition, our closing of the Keymile Acquisition could give rise to substantial tax liabilities under German law, which could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity.\nStrategic acquisitions or investments that we have made or that we could pursue or make in the future may disrupt our operations and harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made investments in and acquired other companies, including Keymile in 2019, that we believe are complementary to our core business and are consistent with our growth strategy. In the future we may continue to make investments in or acquire other companies or complementary solutions or technologies as part of our growth strategy. Any such acquisition or investment may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt or assumption of liabilities, and increase our risk of litigation exposure, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the resulting business from such a transaction fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial condition may suffer or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nAdditionally, any significant acquisition would require the consent of our lenders. Any failure to receive such consent could delay or prohibit us from acquiring companies that we believe could enhance our business. Furthermore, we may dedicate significant time and capital resources in the pursuit of acquisition opportunities and may be unable to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or business opportunities or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular strategic partner.\nUpon the closing of any acquisition transaction, we will need to integrate the acquired organization and its products and services with our legacy operations. The integration process may be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers, distributors and suppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of complementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipated. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently subject to increased risk and to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Any failure to successfully acquire and integrate acquired organizations and their products and services could seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nSome of the risks that could affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, including Keymile\u2019s telecommunication systems business, include those associated with:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nconforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ncoordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after the announcement of acquisition plans or transactions;\n\u2022\nhiring and training additional management and other critical personnel;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource and other administrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nthe geographic distance between the companies;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with covenants related to the acquired business;\n\u2022\nunknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed liabilities for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, employment claims, pension liabilities, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims for terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and which may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, the end of our fiscal year. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of the unremediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nManagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, because of the unremediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Management determined that the Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with appropriate accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of US GAAP, including accounting for significant unusual transactions. In addition, the Company did not maintain an effective control environment as it did not appropriately identify internal controls over inventory valuation and revenue. Also, management determined that the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the financial closing process, including controls surrounding monitoring and review of the activity of its foreign subsidiaries. These material weaknesses could result in a misstatement in the financial statements that would result in a material misstatement in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nIf we are not able to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms will be adversely affected. Such a result could negatively impact the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, weaken investor confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe long and variable sales cycles for our products could cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe target customers for our products have substantial and complex networks that they traditionally expand in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, our marketing efforts are focused primarily on prospective customers that may purchase our products as part of a large-scale network deployment. Our target customers typically require a lengthy evaluation, testing and product qualification process. Throughout this process, we are often required to spend considerable time and incur significant expenses educating and providing information to prospective customers about the uses and features of our products. Even after a company makes the final decision to purchase our products, it could deploy our products over extended periods of time. The timing of deployment of our products varies widely, and depends on a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 skill sets, geographic density of potential subscribers, the degree of configuration and integration required to deploy our products, and our customers\u2019 ability to finance their purchase of our products as well as their operations. As a result of any of these factors, our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe market we serve is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nCompetition in communications equipment markets is intense. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages. We are aware of many companies in related markets that address particular aspects of the features and functions that our products provide. Currently, our primary competitors in our core business include ADTRAN, Calix, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLAN business, our competitors include Cisco, Nokia and Tellabs. In our Ethernet switching business, our competitors include Cisco, and Juniper. We also may face competition from other communications equipment companies or other companies that may enter our markets in the future. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and internationally. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more customer financing than we can. In particular, we are encountering price-focused competitors from Asia, especially China, which places pressure on us to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce prices in order to secure customers, we may be unable to sustain gross margins at desired levels or achieve profitability. Competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that render our products less valuable or obsolete.\nIn our markets, principal competitive factors include:\n\u2022\nproduct performance;\n\u2022\ninteroperability with existing products;\n\u2022\nscalability and upgradeability;\n\u2022\nconformance to standards;\n\u2022\nbreadth of services;\n\u2022\nreliability;\n\u2022\nease of installation and use;\n\u2022\ngeographic footprints for products;\n\u2022\nability to provide customer financing;\n\u2022\npricing;\n\u2022\ntechnical support and customer service; and\n\u2022\nbrand recognition.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may have difficulty obtaining or retaining customers, and we could experience price reductions, order cancellations, increased expenses and reduced gross margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIf demand for our products and solutions does not develop as we anticipate, then our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity will be adversely affected.\nOur future revenue depends significantly on our ability to successfully develop, enhance and market our products and solutions to our target markets. Most network service providers have made substantial investments in their current infrastructure, and they may elect to remain with their current architectures or to adopt new architectures in limited stages or over extended periods of time. A decision by a customer to purchase our products will involve a significant capital investment. We must convince our service provider customers that they will achieve substantial benefits by deploying our products for future upgrades or expansions. We may experience difficulties with product reliability, partnering, and sales and marketing efforts that could adversely affect our business and divert management attention and resources from our core business. We do not know whether a viable market for our products and solutions will develop or be sustainable in our businesses. If these markets do not develop or develop more slowly than we expect, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity will be materially harmed.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in end-user requirements, frequent new product introductions and changes in communications offerings from network service provider customers. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, products that meet changing customer demands and industry standards. We may not have sufficient resources to successfully and accurately anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and technological trends, manage long development cycles or develop, introduce and market new products and enhancements. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to develop new products or enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments, our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software often contains defects or programming flaws that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. In addition, our products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks. Because of the nature of these products, they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic, and there is no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects. As a result, our customers may discover errors or defects in our hardware or software, or our products may not operate as expected. If we are unable to cure a product defect, we could experience damage to our reputation, reduced customer satisfaction, loss of existing customers and failure to attract new customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, reduced sales opportunities, loss of revenue and market share, increased service and warranty costs, diversion of development resources, legal actions by our customers, and increased insurance costs. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could also result in damages to our customers, financial or otherwise. Our customers could seek damages for related losses from us, which could seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly. The occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIncreased tariffs on products and goods that we purchase from off-shore sources (particularly Chinese sources) and changes in international trade policies and relations could have an adverse effect on our customers and operating results.\nThe pricing of our products to customers and our ability to conduct business with certain customers can be affected by changes in U.S. and other countries\u2019 trade policies. For example, while a trade deal was signed between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020 that signals a cooling of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, concerns over the stability of bilateral trade relations remain. Before the trade deal, the United States had recently imposed tariffs on a wide-range of products and goods manufactured in China that are directly or indirectly imported into the United States. In response, various countries and economic regions announced plans or intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide-range of products they import from the United States. Any newly imposed, announced and threatened U.S. tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have the effect of increasing the cost of materials we use to manufacture certain products, which could result in lower margins. The tariffs could also result in disruptions to our supply chain, as suppliers struggle to fill orders from companies trying to purchase goods in bulk ahead of announced tariffs. Although we believe that the incremental costs to us of recent tariffs was immaterial, if new tariffs are imposed or if new tariffs apply to additional categories of components used in our manufacturing activities, and if we are unable to pass on the costs of tariffs to our customers, our operating results would be harmed. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, or U.S.-China relations could result in\nrevisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, trade sanctions, or retaliatory actions by China in response to U.S. actions, which could have an adverse effect on our customers, business plans and operating results.\nSales to communications service providers are especially volatile, and weakness in sales orders from this industry could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSales activity in the service provider industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic and business conditions in the country of operations. Although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years, weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Changes in technology, competition, overcapacity, changes in the service provider market, regulatory developments and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers, with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results, and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing requirements.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to perform a portion of the manufacturing operations for our products. These contract manufacturers build products for other companies, including our competitors. In addition, we do not have contracts in place with some of these providers and may not be able to effectively manage those relationships. We cannot be certain that our contract manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. We face a number of risks associated with this dependence on contract manufacturers including reduced control over delivery schedules, the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand, poor manufacturing yields and high costs, quality assurance, increases in prices, and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, problems with our contract manufacturers, such as inferior quality, insufficient quantities and late delivery of products.\nA shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly could result in excess or obsolete component inventories that could adversely affect our gross margins.\nOccasionally, we may experience a supply shortage, or a delay in receiving, certain component parts as a result of strong demand for the component parts and/or capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. Conversely, we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price, our gross margins could decrease. In the past we experienced component shortages that adversely affected our financial results and, in the future, may continue to experience component shortages.\nWe depend on a limited source of suppliers for several key components. If we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements, which would harm our business.\nWe currently purchase several key components from a limited number of suppliers. If any of our limited source of suppliers become insolvent, cease business or experience capacity constraints, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedules. Our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, be acquired by our competitors, stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices, refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their products from their suppliers. If we do not receive critical components from our limited source of suppliers in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. Any failure to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements could materially adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition and liquidity and could materially damage customer relationships.\nThe loss of a key customer or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is dependent on several key customers. A loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers, or a dispute or litigation with one of these key customers could affect adversely our revenue and results of operations. A significant\ndeterioration in the financial condition or bankruptcy filing of a key customer could affect adversely the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of accounts receivable from its key customers. As of December 31, 2019, two (2) customers represented 18% and 11% of net accounts receivable. If one or more of the Company\u2019s top customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the products and services provided by the Company, then the Company may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable or incur other impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant turnover with respect to our executives and our board, and our business could be adversely affected by these and other transitions in our senior management team or if any future vacancies cannot be filled with qualified replacements in a timely manner.\nWe experienced significant turnover on our executive team and board in both 2018 and 2019, including the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer. As a result of this turnover, our remaining management team has been required to take on increased responsibilities, which could divert attention from key business areas. If we continue to experience similar turnover in the future, we may be unable to timely replace the talent and skills of our management team and directors.\nManagement transitions are often difficult and inherently cause some loss of institutional knowledge, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to execute our business strategies may be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with these transitions and the time and attention from the board and management needed to fill any future vacant roles could disrupt our business. If we are unable to successfully identify and attract adequate replacements for future vacancies in our management roles in a timely manner, we could experience increased employee turnover and harm to our business, growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We face significant competition for executives with the qualifications and experience we seek.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that we will not face similar turnover in the future. Our senior management\u2019s knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace, and any further turnover could negatively affect our business, growth, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecreased effectiveness of share-based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nWe have historically used equity incentives, including stock options, as a key component of our employee compensation program in order to align the interests of our employees with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. If the trading price of our common stock declines, this would reduce the value of our share-based compensation to our present employees and could adversely affect our ability to retain existing or attract prospective employees. Difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could also make it harder or more expensive for us to grant share-based payments to employees in the future.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel, and any failure to do so could harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and other key employees, and our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to build and operate our business. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Moreover, our historical inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified accounting personnel with expertise in US GAAP has adversely affected our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and our ability to produce reliable financial reports, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various elements of the technology used to develop these products. We cannot assure you that our existing or future third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to maintain or obtain any third-party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at greater cost.\nOur intellectual property rights could prove difficult to protect and enforce.\nWe generally rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secret laws and commercial agreements containing restrictions on disclosure and other appropriate terms to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality, employee, contractor and commercial agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and use of our intellectual property and technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties, including those affiliated with foreign governments, may\nattempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, technology or intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries or jurisdictions where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. We cannot assure you that our pending, or any future, patent applications will be granted, that any existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any existing or future patents will be enforceable or that infringement by third parties will even be detected. While we are not dependent on any individual patents, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create the innovative products.\nClaims that our current or future products or components contained in our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly and time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nThe communications equipment industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights, that may relate to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. From time to time, we receive correspondence from companies claiming that our products are using technology covered by or related to the intellectual property rights of these companies and inviting us to discuss or demanding licensing or royalty arrangements for the use of the technology or seeking payment for damages, injunctive relief and other available legal remedies through litigation. These companies also include third-party non-practicing entities (also known as patent trolls) that focus on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights through litigation or the threat of litigation. These companies typically have little or no product revenues and therefore our patents could provide little or no deterrence against such companies filing patent infringement lawsuits against us. In addition, third parties have initiated and could continue to initiate litigation against our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or even our customers alleging infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights with respect to existing or future products, or components of our products. For example, various proceedings have been commenced against Broadcom Corporation and other parties alleging patent infringement in various jurisdictions, and in some cases the courts have issued rulings adverse to Broadcom enjoining Broadcom from offering, distributing, using or importing products that include the challenged intellectual property. Although we are not party to these proceedings, adverse rulings or injunctive relief awarded against Broadcom or other key suppliers of components for our products could result in delays or stoppages in the shipment of affected components, or require us to recall, modify or redesign our products containing such components. Regardless of the merit of claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or customers, intellectual property litigation can be time consuming and costly, and result in the diversion of the attention of technical and management personnel. Any such litigation could force us to stop manufacturing, selling, distributing, exporting, incorporating or using products or components that include the challenged intellectual property, or to recall, modify or redesign such products. In addition, if a party accuses us of infringing upon its proprietary rights, we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation, we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights. Any of these events or results could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, increasing legal requirements.\nWe collect, process, store, use, and transmit personal data on a daily basis. Personal data is increasingly subject to legal and regulatory protections around the world, which vary widely in approach and which possibly conflict with one another. In recent years, for example, U.S. legislators and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, as well as U.S. states have increased their focus on protecting personal data by law and regulation and have increased enforcement actions for violations of privacy and data protection requirements. The European Commission also recently approved and adopted the GDPR, a recent data protection law, which became effective in May 2018. These data protection laws and regulations are intended to protect the privacy and security of personal data that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the relevant jurisdiction. Implementation of and compliance with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could otherwise adversely affect our business operations, which could negatively impact our financial position or cash flows.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services, maintain financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, our information technology systems could be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Furthermore, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial, legal or reputational damage to the Company.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, the suspension of production or prohibitions on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced and the impact that they could have on our operations or results. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, for implementation in European Union member states. We are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or has been considered in the U. S., as well as other countries, such as Japan and China. Our failure to comply with any such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in us being liable for costs, fines, penalties or third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries or jurisdictions where such regulations apply.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties. A significant portion of our revenues is generated from sales outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business and future operating results are subject to global economic and market conditions.\nMarket turbulence and weak economic conditions, as well as concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment could impact our business in a number of ways, including:\nPotential deferment of purchases and orders by customers: Uncertainty about global economic conditions could cause consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to flat revenue budgets, tighter credit, decreased cash availability and weak consumer confidence. Accordingly, future demand for our products could differ materially from our current expectations.\nCustomers\u2019 inability to obtain financing to make purchases and/or maintain their business: Some of our customers require substantial financing in order to finance their business operations, including capital expenditures on new equipment and equipment upgrades, and make purchases from us. The potential inability of these customers to access the capital needed to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves, including factoring credit arrangements to financial institutions, it is possible that we may have to defer revenue until cash is collected or write-down or write-off uncollectible accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If our customers become insolvent due to market and economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers, distributors and retailers: We make sales in certain regions through third-party dealers, distributors and retailers. These third parties may be impacted, among other things, by a significant decrease in available credit. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or from us directly, it could adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers: Our ability to meet customers\u2019 demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, credit constraints of key suppliers could result in accelerated payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.\nWe may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity as a result of weak or recessionary economic or market conditions in the United States, Korea, Germany, or the rest of the world.\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.\nWe currently have significant operations in India, Korea, and Vietnam, as well as sales and technical support teams in various locations around the world. We expect to continue expanding our international operations in the future. The successful management and expansion of our international operations requires significant human effort and the commitment of substantial financial resources. Further, our international operations may be subject to certain risks, disruptions and challenges that could materially harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in laws, policies and regulatory requirements, including but not limited to regulations related to import-export control;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, tariffs, embargoes and other regulatory requirements which could affect our ability to import or export our products into or from various countries;\n\u2022\npolitical unrest or instability, acts of terrorism or war in countries where we or our suppliers or customers have operations, including heightened security concerns stemming from North Korea in relation to our operations in Korea;\n\u2022\npolitical considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and customizing our products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on cash repatriation;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection cycles and financial instability of customers;\n\u2022\nrequirements for additional liquidity to fund our international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and excessive costs for staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, some of our customer purchase agreements are governed by foreign laws and regulations, which may differ significantly from the laws and regulations of the United States. We may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages, if awarded. Any of these factors could harm our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe conduct significant business in Korea, Japan, India, Vietnam, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, all of which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWe have in the past and may in the future undertake a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments, which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAs such, our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, and could materially impact our supply chain and the operations of our customers and suppliers.\nOur global headquarters are located in California near major geologic faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past. An earthquake or other natural disaster or power shortages or outages could disrupt operations or impair critical systems. Any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. Disasters occurring at our or our vendors\u2019 facilities also could impact our reputation.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a material impact on our business and a sustained global outbreak could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in increased travel restrictions and the extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region and within Greater China. Since that time, other countries including the United States, South Korea, Italy and Japan have experienced widespread or sustained transmission of the virus, and there is a risk that the virus will continue to spread to additional countries.\nThe Company relies on suppliers and contract manufacturers located in China and has significant business operations in South Korea and Japan. The outbreak may have a significant impact on our first quarter 2020 results, as we have experienced a negative impact on our supply chain in Asia and softer product demand due to the effects of the virus. These effects include travel restrictions, business closures, public health concerns, and other actions affecting the supply of labor and the export of raw materials and finished products. If the virus continues to spread, the effects of the virus could continue to materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are forced to arrange alternative manufacturing and supply sources, our cost of production could increase materially, negatively affecting our financial condition and results of operations\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the virus and the worldwide response related thereto, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The impact of a continued COVID-19 outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nThe telecommunications networking business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the regulatory environment affecting generally accepted accounting principles is uncertain. Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our business.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current regulatory environment affecting generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) is uncertain. Significant changes in U.S. GAAP could affect our financial statements going forward and may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results. U.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts, accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles. The cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition.\nChanges in government regulations related to our business could harm our operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). The FCC has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry in the United States and, as a result, our existing and future products and our customers\u2019 products are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Changes to current FCC rules and regulations and future FCC rules and regulations could negatively affect our business. Non-compliance with the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations would expose us to potential enforcement actions, including monetary forfeitures, and could damage our reputation among potential customers. The uncertainty associated with future FCC decisions may cause network service providers to delay decisions regarding their capital expenditures for equipment for broadband services. In addition, international regulatory bodies establish standards that may govern our products in foreign markets. The SEC has adopted disclosure rules regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. These rules may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply \u201cconflict free\u201d components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain \u201cconflict free\u201d products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Also, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products. In addition, governments and regulators in many jurisdictions have implemented or are evaluating regulations relating to cyber security, privacy and data protection, which can affect the markets and requirements for networking and communications equipment. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of government regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted in the future, any of which could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business. Because of our smaller size, legislation or governmental regulations can significantly increase our costs and affect our competitive position. Changes to or future domestic and international regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals that could, in the future, be required to operate our business.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and could harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the communications equipment market for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, rapid consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of customers we serve. The loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nDNI owns a significant amount of our outstanding common stock and has the ability to exert significant influence or control over any matters that require stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of certain transactions, and DNI\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, DNI owned approximately 44.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, representing a significant amount of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting. Due to its significant ownership percentage of our common stock, DNI has the ability to substantially influence or control the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of certain transactions. The interests of DNI may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness and may cause us to take actions that our other stockholders or holders of our indebtedness do not view as beneficial.\nDNI\u2019s large concentration of stock ownership may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire us. A potential third-party acquirer would be required to negotiate any such transaction with DNI, and the interests of DNI with respect to such transaction may be different from the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness.\nAdditionally, two of the Company\u2019s directors serve as executive officers of DNI - Min Woo Nam (who also serves as Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Compensation Committee and Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Company) is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of DNI and Choon Yul Yoo is the Chief Operating Officer of DNI. Each of Messrs. Nam and Yoo owe fiduciary duties to us and, in addition, have duties to DNI. As a result, these directors may face real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and DNI.\nPrior to May 20, 2019, DNI owned more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which allowed us to elect to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we were exempt from certain corporate governance requirements under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, including the requirement that we have a majority of independent directors on the Board of Directors and requirements with respect to compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees. Following the loss of \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status, we are required to phase in compliance with the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements over a one-year period. As of the date hereof, the Company is relying on the \u201cphase-in\u201d transition schedule with respect to the composition of the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee. The Board intends to cause both of these committees to consist solely of independent directors on or before May 20, 2020.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders (except for causes of action arising under the federal securities laws), which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws; and\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein; provided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States. The exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws does not apply to resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that the exclusive forum provision of federal district courts of the United States for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. However, this decision is pending before the Delaware Supreme Court and could be overturned.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions could harm our stockholders\u2019 investments and discourage them from suing our directors for breach of their fiduciary duties.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation, as restated, may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. A stockholder\u2019s investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any director or officer.\nThere is a limited public market of our common stock.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 75,000 shares per day. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares of our common stock could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares without depressing the market price of our common stock.\nDNI, our largest stockholder, owned 9.5 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2019 and has the right to require us to register, from time to time, the resale of those shares with the SEC. If DNI were to exercise its registration rights, its shares would become eligible for resale upon registration without restriction as to volume limitations. Our stock price could suffer a significant decline as a result of any sudden increase in the number of shares sold in the public market or market perception that the increased number of shares available for sale will exceed the demand for our common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, holders of our common stock will not receive any return on their investment unless they sell their securities, and holders may be unable to sell their securities on favorable terms or at all.\nFuture issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing stockholders\u2019 equity ownership.\nWe may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital, support growth, or, as we have in recent years, to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options, grant restricted stock awards or other equity awards to retain, compensate and/or motivate our employees and directors. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89925, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "DZSI"}
