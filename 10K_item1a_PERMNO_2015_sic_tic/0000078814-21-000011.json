RISK FACTORS\nOur operations face certain risks that should be considered in evaluating our business. We manage and mitigate these risks on a proactive basis, using an enterprise risk management program. Nevertheless, the following risk factors, some of which may be beyond our control, could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation, and may cause future results to be materially different than our current expectations. These risk factors are not intended to be all inclusive.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nOur operations and financial performance are being affected and will continue to be affected by the global coronavirus outbreak. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 crisis is unknown and constantly changing, and a prolonged duration of this crisis or the emergence of another similar virus in the future could have a significantly material effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is impacting, and is expected to continue to impact, our business, operations and financial performance. Given the unpredictability of the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including various governments\u2019 responses to the pandemic, its effect on the global economy, and the efficacy and availability of a vaccine, the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain. There are many factors, not within our control, which could affect the pandemic's ultimate outcome on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame. These include, but are not limited to: the response of the government, businesses and individuals to the pandemic; an acceleration of the decline in the use of physical mail; the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and economic activity; the changing spending habits of consumers and businesses; disruptions in global supply chains; and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In addition to having the effect of potentially heightening many of our other risk factors in this section, the COVID-19 pandemic may, or may continue to, adversely affect the following to the detriment of our business, including:\n\u2022Accelerate the decline of physical mail volume in the geographies in which we operate, which adversely affects both our Presort Services and SendTech Solutions segments. We cannot yet assess the extent to which these declines in mail volumes, and resulting impact to our business, are permanent or temporary.\n\u2022The adverse effect that declines in physical mail are having on the financial health of posts around the world, especially that of the USPS. If these financial difficulties are not resolved, or if any resolution requires them to operate differently, price in a manner that hurts their competitiveness or further reduces postal volume, or causes them to change their contractual relationships with their partners or vendors, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Social distancing rules and heightened security policies have inhibited, and may continue to inhibit, our ability to sell products and provide services to our clients, fulfill orders and install equipment on a timely basis and market to prospective new clients.\n\u2022The increased costs and reduced labor productivity associated with extended safety protocols, including sanitizing facilities and equipment multiple times a day and incremental costs that may be required to hire temporary labor or redirect volumes to other facilities.\n\u2022Our Global Ecommerce segment could experience further capacity and cost issues due to further sudden and significant increases in volumes resulting from COVID-19, including costs and capacity issues relating to postage, transportation, labor, and warehouse space.\n\u2022Significant declines in the retail industry caused by the pandemic. Although our Global Ecommerce segment has seen an increase in volume of packages in the short-term, should there be a long-term change in consumer sentiment or purchasing habits it could have a material effect on our retail clients, including some of our largest clients, which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\n\u2022A decline in the frequency of long-distance airplane flights may continue to result in higher costs and at times, reduced demand for our Global Ecommerce cross-border offerings.\n\u2022We could experience further increases in delinquencies in collections and bankruptcies in our clients, which could affect our cash flow. Client requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications could also reduce the profitability or ongoing cash flow from some of our current customers.\n\u2022Our suppliers and third-party service providers may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us. If they are unable to satisfy these obligations, it could affect our ability to satisfy service or sales obligations to our clients, or it may affect other aspects of our internal operations.\n\u2022A prolonged duration or resurgence of COVID-19 could adversely impact our earnings or cash flows, which could result in additional credit rating downgrades, higher costs of borrowing, or limit our access to additional debt.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many other risks, including the risks listed below and may also affect our business, operations and financial performance in a manner that is not presently known to us.\nMailing and Shipping Industry Risks\nFurther significant deterioration in the financial condition of the USPS, or the national posts in our other major markets could affect the ability of those posts to provide services to us or our clients, which could adversely affect client demand for our offerings and thus our financial performance.\nWe are dependent on financially viable national posts in the geographic markets where we operate, particularly in the United States. A significant portion of our revenue depends upon the ability of these posts, especially the USPS to provide competitive mail and package delivery services to our clients and the quality of the services they provide. Their ability to provide high quality service at affordable rates in turn depends upon their ongoing financial strength. If the posts are unable to continue to provide these services into the future, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete in the package shipping market in the United States depends upon certain contractual relationships we have with the USPS and the successful performance of those services.\nThe USPS is our primary provider for the \u201clast mile\u201d component of our parcel delivery services in the United States. This represents a significant component of our cost in offering these services. If we are unable to receive competitive pricing from the USPS or take advantage of lower cost USPS options, our ability to compete with private carriers and to achieve profitable revenue growth will be adversely affected. The quality of service we provide to our clients also depends upon the quality of delivery services received from the USPS. The dramatic increase in parcel volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during the peak holiday season, as well as the broader effects of the pandemic on the USPS' operations, has adversely impacted the quality of delivery performance from the USPS and some of our costs with them increased. If its performance does not revert to prior levels, or becomes materially worse than that of the private carriers, we may lose clients to competition and our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to postal regulations and processes, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA significant portion of our business is subject to regulation and oversight by the USPS and posts in other major markets. These postal authorities have the power to regulate some of our current products and services. They also must approve many of our new or future product and service offerings before we can bring them to market. If our new or future product and service offerings are not approved, there are significant conditions to approval, regulations on our existing products or services are changed or, we fall out of compliance with those regulations, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to respond to the continuing decline in the volume of physical mail delivered via traditional postal services, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nTraditional mail volumes continue to decline and impact our current and future financial results, primarily within our SendTech Solutions and Presort Services segments. This rate of decline has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but we cannot yet assess the extent to which this decline, and resulting impact to our business, is permanent or temporary. Any further accelerated or sudden decline in physical mail volumes could have an adverse effect on these segments. An accelerated or sudden decline could result from changes in communication behavior or available communication technologies, reductions to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) under which the USPS and other national posts are required to deliver to every address in a country with similar pricing and frequency, pandemics, and legislation or regulations that mandate electronic substitution for communication by mail, prohibit certain types of mailings, increase the difficulty of using information or materials in the mail, or impose higher taxes or fees on postal services. If we are not successful at meeting the continuing challenges faced in our mailing business, or if physical mail volumes were to experience an accelerated or sudden decline, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nBusiness Operational Risks\nThe transformation of our businesses to more digital and package related services will result in a decline in our overall profit margins. If we cannot increase our volumes while at the same time reduce our costs, our overall profitability could be adversely affected.\nAs we transform our business to more digital and package related delivery services, the relative revenue contribution from our package delivery offerings now exceeds that of the revenue from our mailing-related offerings. We expect the portion of our revenue derived from package delivery offerings to continue to grow. The profit margins in these package-related offerings are generally lower than those for our mailing-related offerings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient scale, or are unable to lower per package costs as we achieve scale, our overall profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of any of our largest clients in our Global Ecommerce segment could adversely affect the financial performance of that segment.\nThe Global Ecommerce segment receives a large portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of clients and business partners. The loss of any of these larger clients or business partners, or a substantial reduction in their use of our products or services, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of the segment. There can be no assurance that our larger clients and business partners will continue to utilize our products or services at current levels, or that we would be able to replace any of these clients or business partners with others who can generate revenue at current levels.\nA material change in consumer sentiment or spending habits that negatively impacts our retail clients could adversely affect the financial performance of our Global Ecommerce segment.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment derives the majority of its revenue from retail clients. The retail industry is subject to cyclical trends in consumer sentiment and spending habits that are affected by many factors, including prevailing economic conditions (including those caused by the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), recession or fears of recession and unemployment levels. If consumer sentiment and spending habits deteriorate such that the demand for our retail clients\u2019 products are negatively impacted, it could potentially have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our third-party suppliers and outsource providers, our business, financial performance and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services and product components, the hosting of our SaaS offerings, the logistics portion of our ecommerce segment, the provision of temporary labor and some non-core functions and operations. Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors in other contexts. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors around the world because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. To a certain extent in 2020, the performance of our outsourced service providers, due largely to circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted our ability to timely execute transactions with our clients, consumers and other constituents. If production or services were interrupted for any reason, the quality of those offerings were to degrade as a result of poor supplier performance, these suppliers chose to terminate their relationship with us, or if the costs of using these third parties were to increase and we were not able to find alternate suppliers, we could experience loss of clients, significant disruptions in manufacturing and operations (including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs) as well as increased costs in the logistics portion of our Global Ecommerce segment.\nFluctuations in transportation costs or disruptions to transportation services in our Global Ecommerce or Presort Services segments could adversely affect client satisfaction or our financial performance.\nIn addition to our reliance on the USPS, our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services segments rely upon independent third-party transportation service providers to transport a significant portion of our parcel and mail volumes. The use of these providers is subject to risks, including our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, increased competition during peak periods, capacity issues, performance problems, extreme weather, natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, increased fuel costs, labor shortages or disputes or other unforeseen difficulties. Any disruption to the timely supply of these services for any reason or any dramatic increase in the cost of these services could adversely affect client satisfaction or our financial performance. The dramatic increase in demand for shipping services, especially in the fourth quarter of the year, caused us to incur higher costs and declines in performance and client satisfaction. Although we proactively manage our volumes, especially during the peak holiday season, given our reliance upon these providers, any future unforeseen disruptions affecting these providers could similarly adversely affect client satisfaction and our financial performance.\nOur business depends on the availability of, and our ability to attract and retain, employees at a reasonable cost to meet the needs of our business and to consistently deliver highly differentiated, competitive offerings.\nThe rapid growth of the ecommerce industry has resulted in intense competition for employees in the shipping, transportation and logistics industry, including drivers and warehouse employees. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this industry growth resulting in our Global Ecommerce segment experiencing a higher demand, and increased competition, for labor, especially in our warehouses. This demand and increased competition for workers has also impacted our Presort Services segment, which has experienced staffing shortages. Although we supplement our workforce with contingent hourly workers from staffing agencies on an as-needed basis, due to the accelerated demand and competition, concern over exposure to COVID-19 and other factors, we could continue to experience a decrease in the pool of available qualified talent. There is also significant competition for the talent needed to develop our other products. Increased competition for employees may result in increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets. Additional labor costs which may also impact our business include those triggered by regulatory actions; increased health care and workers\u2019 compensation insurance expenses; and, those costs associated\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, which in our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services segments, continues to include costs resulting from reduced productively (staggering shifts and breaks to enhance social distancing), costs for extended safety protocols in our warehouses (sanitizing equipment multiple times a day and providing personal protection equipment) and incremental costs required to hire temporary labor.\nOur inability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement by others may negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents and licenses; however, our business success depends in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights, including proprietary technology developed or obtained through acquisitions. We rely on copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The continued evolution of patent law and the nature of our innovation work may affect the number of patents we are able to receive for our development efforts. As we continue to transition our business to more software and service-based offerings, patent protection of these innovations will be more difficult to obtain. In addition, from time to time, third-parties may claim that we, our clients, or our suppliers, have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, if successful, may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products.\nIf we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, our financial performance, brand name and reputation could suffer.\nWe have a significant number of contracts with governmental entities. Government contracts are subject to extensive and complex procurement laws and regulations, along with regular audits and investigations by government agencies. If one or more government agencies discovers contractual noncompliance by us or one of our subcontractors in the course of an audit or investigation, we may be subject to various civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which could include the termination of the contract, reimbursement of payments received, fines and debarment from doing business with one or more governments. Any of these events could not only affect our financial performance, but also adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestitures which may harm our financial performance.\nAs we transition our business to sustainable long-term growth, we may make strategic acquisitions or divest certain businesses. These actions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance, including:\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated benefits or synergies;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings and entering new markets, or reducing fixed costs previously associated with divested businesses;\n\u2022the loss of key employees or clients of businesses acquired or divested;\n\u2022significant charges for employee severance and other restructuring costs, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees; and\n\u2022possible goodwill and asset impairment charges as divestitures and changes in our business model may adversely affect the recoverability of certain long- lived assets and valuation of our operating segments.\nOur capital investments to develop new products and offerings or expand our current operations may not yield the anticipated benefits.\nWe are making significant capital investments in new products, services, and facilities. If we are not successful in these new product or service introductions at the levels anticipated when making the investments, there may be an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nOur financial performance and our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could be subject to legal liability or regulatory enforcement actions, if we or our suppliers are unable to protect against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents.\nWe depend on the security of our and our suppliers' information technology systems to support numerous business processes and activities, to service our clients and to enable consumer transactions and postal services. There are numerous cybersecurity risks to these systems, including individual and group criminal hackers, industrial espionage, denial of service attacks, malware attacks, computer viruses, vandalism and employee errors and/or malfeasance. These cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of preventing, detecting and successfully defending against them. Successful breaches could, among other things, disrupt our operations, result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse of company, client, consumer and employee sensitive and confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance. Cybersecurity breaches could result in\nfinancial liability to other parties, governmental investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, and penalties, and our brand and reputation could be damaged. Although we maintain insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity incidents, we may incur costs or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through our insurance.\nWe have security systems, procedures and business continuity plans in place-and require our suppliers to have them as well-that are designed to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, to protect against unauthorized access to information or disruption to our services, and to minimize the time to detect, respond or minimize the impact of a breach should one occur. None of those systems, however, are fool proof but, our goal is to prevent meaningful incursions and minimize the time to detect and respond, as well as the overall impact of those that occur, and like all companies, intrusions will occur, and have occurred, from time to time.\nDespite the protections we have in place, we have suffered two significant cyber-events, one in October 2019 and another in May 2020. In 2019, we were affected by a ransomware attack, known as RYUK, that temporarily disrupted customer access to some of our services. Our financial information was not affected and there is no evidence that any sensitive or confidential data was improperly accessed or extracted from our network. Although this attack adversely impacted 2019 revenue by $18 million and earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.08, primarily as a result of the business interruption, incremental costs related to the attack and costs to enhance our cybersecurity protection, we were able to recover $17 million from our insurers in 2020. In addition, in May 2020, we were affected by a Maze ransomware attack. The Maze attackers were able to exfiltrate a small amount of our confidential data, which did not include any client confidential information, but we were able to successfully thwart the attack before any of our ongoing operations could be disrupted. The attempted attack did not have any impact on our financial results, and we satisfied all regulatory obligations arising out of the attack. In response to these attacks, we implemented a variety of measures to further enhance our cybersecurity protections and minimize the impact of any future attack. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and will require us to continually assess and improve our protections; however, there can be no guarantee that a future cyber event will not occur.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and protection laws and regulations could subject us to legal liability and adversely affect our reputation and our financial performance.\nOur businesses use, process and store proprietary information and personal, sensitive or confidential data relating to our business, clients, and employees. Privacy laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business require that we take significant steps to safeguard that information, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting. In addition, new laws may add a broad array of requirements on how we handle or use information and increase our compliance obligations. For example, the European Union greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Law by enacting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which, among other things, enhanced an individual\u2019s rights with respect to their information and ongoing litigation in the European Union continues to create uncertainty in how to demonstrate compliance. In the United States, several states have enacted different laws regarding personal information, including recent changes to privacy laws in California, that impose significant new requirements. Other countries or states may enact laws or regulations in the future that have similar or additional requirements. Although we continually monitor and assess the impact of these laws and regulations, their interpretation and enforcement are uncertain, subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement. Failure to comply with data privacy and protection laws and regulations could also result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation, and adversely affect our reputation and the results of our operations.\nIf we or our suppliers encounter unforeseen interruptions or difficulties in the operation of our cloud-based applications, our business could be disrupted, our reputation and relationships may be harmed and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur business relies upon the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our and our suppliers' cloud-based applications and systems to support numerous business processes, to service our clients and to support their transactions with their customers and postal services. Our applications and systems, and those of our partners, may be subject to interruptions due to technological errors, system capacity constraints, software errors or defects, human errors, computer or communications failures, power loss, adverse acts of nature and other unexpected events. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place to protect our business operations in case of such events and we also require our suppliers to have the same. Nonetheless, there can be no guarantee that these plans will function as designed. If we are unable to limit interruptions or successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all, it could result in lost revenue, loss of critical data, significant expenditures of capital, a delay or loss in market acceptance of our services and damage to our reputation, brand and relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial performance.\nMacroeconomic and General Regulatory Risks\nFuture credit rating downgrades or capital market disruptions could adversely affect our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide competitive financing services to our clients and to fund various discretionary priorities.\nWe provide competitive finance offerings to our clients and fund discretionary priorities, such as business investments, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases through a combination of cash generated from operations, deposits held at the Bank and access to capital markets. Our ability to access U.S. capital markets and the associated cost of borrowing is dependent upon our credit ratings and is subject to capital market volatility. Given our current credit rating, we may experience reduced financial or strategic flexibility and higher costs when we do access the U.S. capital markets. We maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility that requires we maintain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants.\nA significant decline in cash flows, noncompliance with any of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, further credit rating downgrades, material capital market disruptions, significant withdrawals by depositors at the Bank, adverse changes to our industrial loan charter or an increase in our credit default swap spread could impact our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide competitive finance offerings to our clients, refinance maturing debt and fund other financing activities, which in turn, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment is exposed to increased foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe sales generated from many of our clients\u2019 internationally focused websites running on our cross-border platform are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Currently, our platforms are located in the U.S. and the U.K. and a majority of consumers making purchases through these platforms are in a limited number of foreign countries. A strengthening of the U.S. Dollar or British Pound relative to currencies in the countries where we do the most business impacts our ability to compete internationally as the cost of similar international products improves relative to the cost of U.S. and U.K. retailers' products. A strong U.S. Dollar or British Pound would likely result in a decrease in international sales volumes, which would adversely affect the segment's revenue and profitability.\nOur operations and financial performance may be negatively affected by changes in trade policies, tariffs and regulations.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment is subject to significant trade regulations, taxes, and duties throughout the world. Any changes to these regulations could potentially impose increased documentation and delivery requirements, increase costs, delay delivery times, subject us to additional liabilities, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Over the past three years, the United States increased tariffs for certain goods while also raising the possibility of additional tariffs. These actions triggered other nations to also increase tariffs on certain of their goods. For our Global Ecommerce segment, tariff increases, or even the political environment surrounding trade issues, could reduce demand and adversely affect our financial performance. For our SendTech Solutions segment, the increased tariffs resulted in additional costs on certain components used in some of our products. Although we have been taking actions to mitigate these costs by changing where we source certain parts, these added costs and the potential for further tariffs could affect demand for our products or the amount of profitability in some of our products and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur operational costs could increase from changes in environmental regulations, or we could be subject to significant liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations around the world, including without limitation, those related to the manufacture, distribution, use, packaging, labeling, recycling or disposal of our products or the products of our clients for whom we perform services. Environmental rules concerning products and packaging can have a significant impact on the cost of operations or affect our ability to do business in certain countries. We are also subject to laws concerning use, discharge or disposal of materials. These laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Additionally, the change in the Presidential administration may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new legislation or directives by government authorities. If we are found to have violated these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, otherwise sanctioned by regulators, or we could be subject to liability and clean-up costs. These risks can apply to both current and legacy operations and sites. From time to time, we may be involved in litigation over these issues. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that these costs will not have an adverse effect on our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 24459, "SIC": 3579, "TIC": "PBI"}
