RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. The following information should be read in conjunction with the other portions of this report, including \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Item 1, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, that arise in the future or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. In addition, certain of the risks described below apply only to a part of our business.\nRisks Affecting Our Business\nOur failure to simplify our service support systems could adversely impact our competitive position.\nFor many of our services, we can effectively compete only if we can quickly and efficiently (i) quote and accept customer orders, (ii) provision and initiate ordered services, (iii) provide customers with adequate means to manage their services and (iv) accurately bill for our services. To attain these objectives, we believe we must digitally transform our global service support processes to permit greater automation and customer self-service options. This digital transformation is complex and will require a substantial amount of resources, especially in light of the multiplicity of our systems. Development of systems designed to support this transformation will continuously require our personnel and third-party vendors to, among other things, (i) adjust to changes in our offerings and customers\u2019 preferences, (ii) simplify our processes, (iii) improve our data management capabilities, (iv) eliminate inconsistencies between our legacy and acquired operations, (v) eliminate older support systems that are costly or obsolete, (vi) develop uniform practices and procedures, and (vii) automate them as much as possible. These undertakings will be challenging and time-consuming, and we cannot assure you that they will be successful. Our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we fail to continuously develop viable service support systems that are satisfactory to our current and potential customers.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors.\nEach of our offerings to our customers face increasingly intense competition from a wide variety of sources under evolving market conditions. In particular aggressive competition from a wide range of communications and technology companies has limited the prospects for several of our offerings to our customers. We expect these trends to continue. For more detailed information, see \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nIn addition to competition from a wide range of technology companies and communications providers (including those described above), we are facing increasing competition from several other sources, including cloud companies, broadband providers, software developers, device providers, resellers, sales agents and facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network. Further competition could arise through industry consolidation, technological innovation, or changes in regulation, including changes allowing foreign carriers to more extensively compete in the U.S. market.\nSome of our current and potential competitors (i) offer a more comprehensive range of communications products and services, (ii) offer products or services with features that we cannot readily match in some or all of our markets, (iii) install their services more quickly than we do, (iv) have greater marketing, engineering, research, development, technical, provisioning, customer relations, financial or other resources, (v) have larger or more diverse networks with greater transmission capacity, (vi) conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than us, (vii) are subject to less regulation, which we believe enables such competitors to operate more flexibly than us with respect to certain offerings, (viii) offer services nationally or internationally to a larger geographic area or larger base of customers, (ix) have substantially stronger brand names, which may provide them with greater pricing power than ours, (x) have deeper or more long-standing relationships with key customers, or (xi) have larger operations than ours, which may enable them to compete more successfully in recruiting top talent, entering into operational or strategic partnerships or acquiring companies. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to provide more attractive offerings, to charge lower prices for their products and services, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructure more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to changes in technologies or customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services, to provide more comprehensive customer service, to provide greater resources to research and development initiatives and to take advantage of business or other opportunities more readily.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers, market share, or traffic on our networks, (ii) our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital improvement projects, (iii) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (iv) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new products or services.\nWe are continually taking steps to respond to these competitive pressures, but these efforts may not be successful. Our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected if these initiatives are unsuccessful or insufficient.\nRapid technological changes could significantly impact our competitive and financial position.\nThe communications industry has been and continues to be impacted by significant technological changes, which in general are enabling a much broader array of companies to compete with us. Many of these technological changes are (i) enabling customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks, (ii) displacing or reducing demand for our services, or (iii) enabling the development of competitive products or services. Continuous improvements in wireless data technologies have enabled wireless carriers to offer competing data transmission products that are highly convenient to use, and we expect this trend to continue as technological advances enable these carriers to carry greater amounts of data faster and with less latency.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict or respond to changes in technology or industry standards, or to the introduction of newly-offered services. Any of these developments could make some or all of our offerings less desirable or even obsolete, which would place downward pressure on our market share and revenue. These developments could also require us to (i) expend capital or other resources in excess of currently contemplated levels, (ii) forego the development or provision of products or services that others can provide more efficiently, or (iii) make other changes to our operating plans, corporate strategies or capital allocation plans, any of which could be contrary to the expectations of our security holders or could adversely impact our business operating results.\nEven if we succeed in adapting to changes in technology or industry standards by developing new products or services, there is no assurance that the new products or services would have a positive impact on our profit margins or financial performance.\nIn addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we may need, from time to time, to phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. Similarly, if new market entrants are not burdened by an installed base of outdated equipment or obsolete technology, they may have a competitive advantage over us.\nFor additional information on the risks of increased expenditures, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduces our available free cash flow.\u201d\nOur failure to meet the evolving needs of our customers could adversely impact our competitive position.\nIn order to compete effectively and respond to changing market conditions, we must continuously offer products and services on terms and conditions that allow us to retain and attract customers and to meet their evolving needs. To do so, we must continuously (i) invest in our network, (ii) develop, test and introduce new products and services and (iii) rationalize and simplify our offerings by eliminating older or overlapping products or services. Our ability to maintain attractive products and services and to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis could be constrained by a range of factors, including network limitations, support system limitations, limited capital, an inability to attract key personnel with the necessary skills, intellectual property constraints, inadequate digitization or automation, technological limits or an inability to act as quickly or efficiently as other competitors. Network service enhancements and product launches could take longer or cost more money than expected due to a range of factors, including software issues, supplier delays, testing delays, permitting delays, or network incompatibility issues. In addition, new product or service offerings may not be widely accepted by our customers. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain competitive products and services and to timely and successfully develop and introduce new products or services.\nWe could experience difficulties in consolidating, integrating, updating and simplifying our technical infrastructure.\nOur ability to consolidate, integrate, update and simplify our systems and information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing business needs is very important to our ability to develop and maintain attractive product and service offerings and to interface effectively with our customers. In addition, there may be issues related to our expanded or updated infrastructure that are not identified by our testing processes, and which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the redesigned systems. Our failure to modernize, consolidate and upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, including the delayed implementation of new service offerings, decreased competitiveness of existing service offerings, network instabilities, increased operating or acquisition integration costs, service or billing interruptions or delays, service\noffering inconsistencies, customer dissatisfaction, and the diversion of development resources. In addition, our dedication of significant resources to these projects could divert attention from ongoing operations and other strategic initiatives. Any or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe could be harmed by security breaches or other significant disruptions or failures of networks, information technology infrastructure or related systems owned or operated by us.\nWe are materially reliant upon our networks, information technology infrastructure and related technology systems (including our billing and provisioning systems) to provide products and services to our customers and to manage our operations and affairs. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our information technology infrastructure and related systems. As a communications company that transmits large amounts of information over communications networks, we face an added risk that a security breach or other significant disruption of our network, infrastructure or systems, or those that we operate or maintain for certain of our business customers, could lead to material interruptions or curtailments of service. Moreover, in connection with processing and storing sensitive and confidential customer data, we face a heightened risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 proprietary information.\nTo safeguard our systems and data stored thereon, we strive to maintain effective security measures, disaster recovery plans, business contingency plans and employee training programs, and to continuously upgrade these safeguards. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, hardware or software vulnerabilities, aging equipment or accidental technological failure. These threats may also stem from fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or foreign nations, including attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce our employees or customers to disclose or grant access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, potentially including information subject to stringent domestic and foreign data protection laws governing personally identifiable information, protected health information or other similar types of sensitive data. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on such other systems to deliver services to our customers. Various other factors could intensify these risks, including, (i) our maintenance of information in digital form stored on servers connected to the Internet, (ii) our use of open and software-defined networks, (iii) the complexity of our multi-continent network composed of legacy and acquired properties, (iv) growth in the size and sophistication of our customers and their service requirements, and (v) increased use of our network due to greater demand for data services.\nSimilar to other large communications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees. Although some of these attacks have resulted in security breaches, thus far none of these breaches have resulted in a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. You should be aware, however, that the risk of breaches is likely to increase due to several factors, including the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the wider accessibility of cyber-attack tools. You should be further aware that defenses against cyber-attacks currently available to U.S. companies are unlikely to prevent intrusions by a highly-determined, highly-sophisticated hacker. Consequently, you should assume that we will be unable to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyber-attacks. Any such future security breaches or disruptions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, especially in light of the growing frequency, scope and well-documented sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions.\nAlthough CenturyLink maintains cyber liability insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.\nAdditional risks to our network, infrastructure and related systems include, among others:\n\u2022\ncapacity or system configuration limitations, including those resulting from changes in our customer's usage patterns, the introduction of new technologies or products, or incompatibilities between our newer and older systems;\n\u2022\ntheft or failure of our equipment;\n\u2022\nsoftware or hardware obsolescence, defects or malfunctions;\n\u2022\npower losses or power surges;\n\u2022\nphysical damage, whether caused by fire, flood, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, vandalism or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in our processes or controls;\n\u2022\nour inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills to adequately maintain or improve our systems;\n\u2022\nprogramming, processing and other human error; and\n\u2022\ninadequate building maintenance by third-party landlords or other service failures of our third-party vendors.\nDue to these factors, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future, especially if network traffic continues to increase and we continue to assume greater responsibility for managing our customers\u2019 critical systems and networks.\nDisruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described networks and systems could:\n\u2022\ndisrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt (i) our operational, billing or other administrative functions or (ii) the operations of certain of our customers who rely upon us to provide services critical to their operations;\n\u2022\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our customers\u2019 end users, including trade secrets, which others could use for competitive, disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches;\n\u2022\nrequire us to provide credits for future service under certain service level commitments we have provided contractually to our customers or to offer expensive incentives to retain customers;\n\u2022\nsubject us to claims for damages, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies under our customer contracts or service standards set by regulators, which in certain cases could exceed our insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nresult in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to prolonged litigation; or\n\u2022\nrequire significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the resulting damages or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems.\nAny or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nWe believe our industry is by its nature more prone to reputational risks than many other industries. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends substantially upon external perceptions of our products, services management integrity and financial performance. Customer complaints, governmental investigations, outages, or other service failures of networks operated by us could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us. Similar events impacting other operators could indirectly harm us by causing substantial adverse publicity affecting our industry in general. In either case, press coverage, social media messaging or other public statements that insinuate improper actions by us or other operators, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation, governmental investigations or additional regulations. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees. We could suffer similar adverse effects if shareholders, financial analysts or other financial professionals issue public statements that cast us or our industry in a negative light. Any of these developments could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and the value of our securities.\nMarket prices for many of our services have decreased in the past, and any similar price decreases in the future will adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nOver the past several years, a range of competitive and technological factors, including robust network construction and intense competition, have lowered market prices for many of our products and services. If these market conditions persist, we may need to continue to reduce prices to retain customers and revenue. If future price reductions are necessary, our operating results will suffer unless we are able to offset these reductions by reducing our operating expenses or increasing our sales volumes.\nOur future growth potential will depend in part on the continued development and expansion of the Internet.\nOur future growth potential will depend in part upon the continued development and expansion of the Internet as a communication medium and marketplace for the distribution of data, video, voice and other products by businesses, consumers, and governments. The use of the Internet for these purposes may not grow and expand at the rate anticipated by us or others, or may be restricted by factors outside of our control, including (i) actions by other carriers or governmental authorities that restrict us from delivering traffic over other parties' networks, (ii) changes in regulations, (iii) technological stagnation, (iv) increased concerns regarding cyber threats or (v) changes in consumers' preferences or data usage.\nOur failure to hire and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain executives, managers and employees with technological, engineering, software, product development, operational, provisioning, marketing, sales, customer service, administrative, managerial and other key skills. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in several of these fields, particularly in certain growth markets, such as the areas adjoining our Denver and Seattle offices. We compete with several other companies for this limited pool of potential employees. As our industry increasingly becomes more competitive, it could become especially difficult to attract and retain top personnel with skills in high demand. Other more general factors have further increased the challenges of attracting and retaining talented individuals, including disruptions caused by our workforce reduction and restructuring initiatives over the past couple of years, and the challenges of employing represented and non-represented personnel under different compensation structures. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, our executives and domestic employees do not have long-term employment agreements. For all these reasons, there is no assurance that our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel will be successful.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.\nVideo streaming services, gaming and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than other Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these services continues to grow, our customers will likely use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant budgeted or unbudgeted capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers. Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and\nattract customers in affected markets. Competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude us from recovering the costs of network investments designed to address these issues, which could adversely impact our operating margins, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have been accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others and will likely face similar accusations in the future, which could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or require us to seek third-party licenses.\nLike other communications companies, we have increasingly in recent years received a number of notices from third parties or have been named in lawsuits filed by third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We are currently responding to several of these notices and claims and expect this industry-wide trend will continue. Responding to these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our use of the applicable technology, and divert management\u2019s time and resources away from other business. In certain instances, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments. In the case of litigation, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages or cease using the applicable technology. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our profit margins may decline or our operations could be materially impaired. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could significantly and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSimilarly, from time to time, we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents or other intellectual property from third parties to be able to offer new products and services. If we cannot license or otherwise obtain rights to use any required technology from a third party on reasonable terms, our ability to offer new products and services may be prohibited, restricted, made more costly or delayed.\nWe may not be successful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on various patents, copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property rights, as well as confidentiality agreements and procedures, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These steps, however, may not fully protect us. Others may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, superior to, or otherwise competitive to the technologies we employ in our services; or may intentionally or unintentionally infringe on our intellectual property. Moreover, we may be unable to prevent our current or former employees from using or disclosing to others our proprietary information. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may depend on initiating legal actions against parties who infringe or misappropriate our proprietary information, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. If we are unsuccessful in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur operations, financial performance and liquidity are materially reliant on various third parties.\nReliance on other communications providers. To offer certain services in certain of our markets, we must either purchase services or lease network capacity from, or interconnect our network with the infrastructure of, other communications carriers or cloud companies who typically compete against us in those markets. Our reliance on these supply or interconnection arrangements exposes us to multiple risks. Typically, these arrangements limit our control over the quality of our services and expose us to the risk that our ability to market our services could be adversely impacted by changes in the plans or properties of the carriers upon which we are reliant. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that the other carriers may be unwilling or unable to continue or renew these arrangements in the future on terms favorable to us, or at all. This risk is heightened when the other carrier is a competitor who may benefit from terminating the agreement or imposing price increases, or a carrier who suffers financial distress or bankruptcy. If we lose these arrangements and cannot timely replace them, our ability to provide services to our customers and conduct our business could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, many of our arrangements with other carriers are regulated by domestic or foreign agencies, which subject us to the additional risk that changes in regulation could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our ability to provide services. Finally, even when another carrier agrees or is obligated to provide services to us to permit us to obtain new customers, it is frequently expensive, difficult and time-consuming to switch the new customers to our network, especially if the other carrier fails to provide timely and efficient cooperation.\nConversely, certain of our operations carry a significant amount of voice or data traffic for other communications providers. Their reliance on our services exposes us to the risk that they may transfer all or a\nportion of this traffic from our network to existing or newly-built networks owned or leased by them, thereby reducing our revenue.\nOur operations and financial performance could be adversely affected if our relationships with any of these other communications companies are unable or unwilling to continue to engage with us for any reason, including financial distress, bankruptcy, strikes, regulatory impediments, legal disputes or commercial differences.\nReliance on other key suppliers and vendors. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including fiber optic cable, software, optronics, transmission electronics, digital switches and related components. We also rely on a limited number of software vendors, content suppliers or other parties to assist us with operating, maintaining and administering our business. If any of these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering their products and services on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers and may be adversely affected if third parties assert patent infringement claims against our suppliers or us. Similarly, in certain instances we have access to only a limited number of alternative suppliers or vendors. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, utilities or programming on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\nReliance on utility providers and landlords. Our energy costs can fluctuate significantly or increase for a variety of reasons, including changes in legislation and regulation. Several pending proposals designed to reduce greenhouse emissions could substantially increase our energy costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We lease many of our office facilities, which subjects us to risk of higher future rent payments or non-renewals when our current lease expires.\nReliance on governmental payments. We provide products or services to various federal, state and local agencies. Our failure to comply with complex governmental regulations and laws applicable to these programs, or the terms of our governmental contracts, could result in us being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time. Moreover, certain governmental agencies frequently reserve the right to terminate their contracts for convenience or if funding is unavailable. If our governmental contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from governmental programs or contracts, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nViolating our government contracts could have other serious consequences.\nWe provide services to various governmental agencies with responsibility for national security or law enforcement. These governmental contracts impose significant requirements on us relating to network security, information storage and other matters, and in certain instances impose on us additional heightened responsibilities, including requirements related to the composition of CenturyLink's Board of Directors. While we expect to continue to comply fully with all of our obligations under these contracts, we cannot assure you of this. The consequences of violating these contracts could be severe, potentially including the revocation of our Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) licenses in the U.S. (in addition to being suspended or debarred from government contracting, as noted above.)\nPortions of our property, plant and equipment are located on property owned by third parties.\nWe rely on rights-of-way, colocation agreements, franchises and other authorizations granted by governmental bodies, railway companies, utilities, carriers and other third parties to locate our cable, conduit and other network equipment on or under their respective properties. A significant number of these authorizations are scheduled to lapse over the next five to ten years, unless we are able to extend or renew them. Our operations could be adversely affected if any of these authorizations terminate or lapse, or if the landowner requests price increases. Moreover, our ability to expand our network could depend in part on obtaining additional authorizations, the receipt of which is not assured.\nOver the past few years, certain utilities, cooperatives and municipalities in certain of the states in which we operate have requested significant rate increases for attaching our plant to their facilities. To the extent that these entities are successful in increasing the amount we pay for these attachments, our future operating costs will increase.\nOur subsidiaries currently are, and in the past have been, subject to lawsuits challenging the subsidiaries\u2019 use of rights-of-way. Similar suits are possible in the future. Plaintiffs in these suits typically seek to have them certified as class action suits. These suits are typically complex, lengthy and costly to defend, and expose us to each of the other general litigation risks described elsewhere herein.\nOur major contracts subject us to various risks.\nWe furnish to and receive from our business customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with certain of our operations. Our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nWe have several complex high-value national and global customer contracts. The revenue and profitability of these contracts are frequently impacted by a variety of factors, including variations in cost, attaining milestones, meeting service level commitments, service outages, achieving cost savings anticipated in our contract pricing, changes in our customers\u2019 needs, and our suppliers\u2019 performance. Any of these factors could reduce or eliminate the profitability of these contracts. Moreover, we would be adversely impacted if we fail to renew major contracts upon their expiration.\nOur international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\nOur international operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding operations in international jurisdictions in which we provide services. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, anti-competition laws, trade restrictions, tax laws, immigration laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. Many of these laws are complex and change frequently. Regulations that require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or the employment of local citizens may adversely affect our flexibility or competitiveness in these jurisdictions. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may materially restrict our ability to deliver services in various international jurisdictions or could be breached through inadvertence or mistake, fraudulent or negligent behavior of our employees or agents, failure to comply with certain formal documentation or technical requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our personnel, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business or our ability to operate in one or more countries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nMany non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to communications services are more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations, particularly those relating to privacy rights and data retention. Moreover, national regulatory frameworks that are consistent with the policies and requirements of global organizations and standards have only recently been, or are still being, enacted in many countries. Accordingly, many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market. As a result, in these markets we may encounter more protracted and difficult procedures to obtain licenses necessary to provide the full set of products and services we seek to offer.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u2022\ntax, licensing, political or other business restrictions or requirements, which may render it more difficult to obtain licenses or interconnection agreements on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nuncertainty concerning import and export restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulation of overseas operations, including regulation under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the Brazilian Anti-corruption Law and other applicable anti-corruption laws (collectively with the FCPA, the \"Anti-Corruption Laws\");\n\u2022\neconomic, social and political instability, with the attendant risks of terrorism, kidnapping, extortion, civic unrest and potential seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\ncurrency and exchange controls, repatriation restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchallenges in securing and maintaining the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe inability in certain jurisdictions to enforce contract rights either due to underdeveloped legal systems or government actions that result in a deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of cyber-attacks or similar events to our network as we expand our network or interconnect our network with other networks internationally;\n\u2022\nthe inability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlaws, policies or practices that restrict with whom we can contract or otherwise limit the scope of operations that can legally or practicably be conducted within any particular country;\n\u2022\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a non-U.S. court or arbitration panel;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties, including those with which we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased taxes, increased communications or privacy regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in staffing and managing overseas operations.\nChanges in multilateral conventions, treaties, tariffs or other arrangements between or among sovereign nations could impact us. Specifically, the United Kingdom exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\"Brexit\"), subject to the 11-month transition period further described elsewhere herein, and the British government is currently negotiating the terms of Brexit. Brexit could potentially impact our supply chains, logistics, and human resources, and subject us to additional regulatory complexities. Additionally, Brexit and other changes in multilateral arrangements may more broadly adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control, and we cannot predict the nature or the likelihood of the occurrence or corresponding effect of any such events, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our international operations are conducted in countries or regions experiencing corruption or instability, which subjects us to heightened legal and economic risks.\nWe do business and may in the future do additional business in certain countries or regions in which corruption is a serious problem. Moreover, in order to effectively compete in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under any Anti-Corruption Laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents. Any determination that we have violated any Anti-Corruption Laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\nWe conduct significant operations in regions that have historically experienced high levels of political, economic and social instability, including the Latin American region. Various events in recent years have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of several Latin American countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. Pressures or volatility in local or regional currencies may adversely affect our customers in this region, which could diminish their ability or willingness to order products or services from us. Several Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Governmental actions taken to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have in the past contributed to periodic economic uncertainty in many Latin American countries. Similar actions in the future, together with abrupt shifts in governmental administrations, could impede our ability to develop or implement effective business plans in the region. In addition, if high rates of inflation persist, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset our higher costs. A high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate risks and currency transfer restrictions and our results may suffer due to currency translations and re-measurements.\nDeclines in the value of non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect us in several respects, including hampering our ability to market our services to customers whose revenue is denominated in depreciated currencies. In addition, where we issue invoices for our services in currencies other than U.S. dollars, our results of operations may suffer due to currency translations if such currencies depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar and we cannot or do not elect to enter into currency hedging arrangements regarding those payment obligations. Similarly, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and exchange control regulations could negatively impact the ability of overseas customers to pay for our services in U.S. dollars.\nCertain Latin American economies have experienced shortages in non-U.S. currency reserves and have adopted restrictions on the use of certain mechanisms to expatriate local earnings and convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. Any of these shortages or restrictions may limit or impede our ability to transfer or convert those currencies into U.S. dollars and to expatriate those funds.\nAsset dispositions could have a detrimental impact on us or the holders of our securities.\nIn the past, we have disposed of assets or asset groups for a variety of reasons, and we may consider disposing of other assets or asset groups from time to time in the future. We may not be able to divest any such assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all. In addition, if we agree to proceed with any such divestitures of assets, we may experience operational difficulties segregating them from our retained assets and operations, which could impact the execution or timing for such dispositions and could result in disruptions to our operations or claims for damages, among other things. Moreover, such dispositions could reduce our cash flows and make it harder for us to fund all of our cash requirements.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, including unstable economic and credit markets or depressed economic activity caused by trade wars, epidemics, pandemics or other factors, could negatively affect our business. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of these general economic conditions, they could adversely affect demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forego purchases of our products and services. These conditions impact, in particular, our ability to sell discretionary products or services to business customers that are under pressure to reduce costs or to governmental customers operating under budgetary constraints. Any one or more of these circumstances could continue to depress our revenue. Also, our customers may encounter financial hardships or may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could negatively impact their ability to make timely payments to us. In addition, as discussed further below, unstable economic and credit markets may preclude us from refinancing maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. For these reasons, among others, weak economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFor additional information about our business and operations, see \"Business\" in Item 1 of this report.\nOur consolidated revenue is concentrated in a couple top customers.\nApproximately 3% of our consolidated revenue is attributable to our top customer, and approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue is attributable to our top two customers. If we lost either or both of these customers, or either of them materially decreased its orders for our services, our business would be adversely affected.\nFor additional information about our business and operations, see \"Business\" in Item 1 of this report.\nAlthough we believe our business has been successfully integrated into CenturyLink\u2019s business, additional challenges may remain.\nIn late 2017, this transaction combined two companies which previously operated as independent public companies. Although, we believe the integration of the two companies has been successfully completed, additional challenges could arise, including those relating to the following:\n\u2022\nthe complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, regulatory restrictions, operating structures, lending arrangements and markets;\n\u2022\nthe complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel from the two companies, while at the same time attempting to provide consistent, high-quality products and services under a unified culture; and\n\u2022\nimpediments to fully and timely integrating systems, technologies, procedures, policies, standards and controls.\nOur failure to adequately address these and related challenges could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFor additional information about our business and operations, see \"Business\" in Item 1 of this report.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our operations and a variety of risks relating to such regulation.\nGeneral. Our domestic operations are regulated by the FCC, various state utility commissions and occasionally by local agencies. Our domestic operations are also subject to potential investigation and legal action by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and other federal and state regulatory authorities over issues such as consumer marketing, competitive practices, and privacy protections. Our non-domestic operations are regulated by supranational groups (such as the European Union), national agencies and frequently state, provincial or local bodies.\nGenerally, we must obtain and maintain operating licenses from these bodies in most territories where we offer regulated services. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining or retaining all licenses necessary to carry out our business plan. Even if we are, the prescribed service standards and conditions imposed on us under these licenses may increase our costs and limit our operational flexibility. We also operate in some areas of the world without licenses, as permitted through relationships with locally-licensed partners.\nWe are subject to numerous requirements and interpretations under various international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, which are often quite detailed and occasionally in conflict with each other. The regulation of telecommunications networks and services around the world varies widely. In some countries, the range of services we are legally permitted to provide may be limited or may change. As noted above, in other countries existing telecommunications legislation is in development, is subject to currently ongoing proceedings, is unclear or inconsistent, or is applied in an unequal or unpredictable fashion, often in the absence of adjudicative forums that are adequate to address disputes. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we will always be considered to be in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time (as discussed further elsewhere herein). Our inability or failure to comply with the telecommunications and other laws of one or more countries in which we operate could prevent us from commencing or continuing to provide service therein.\nThe agencies responsible for the enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations may initiate inquiries or actions based on customer complaints or on their own initiative. Even if we are ultimately found to have complied with applicable regulations, such actions or inquiries could create adverse publicity that negatively impacts our business.\nDomestic regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change, and the regulatory environment varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A substantial portion of our local voice services revenue remains subject to FCC and state utility commission pricing regulation, which periodically exposes us to pricing or earnings disputes and could expose us to unanticipated price declines. In addition, from time to time carriers or other third parties refuse to pay for certain of our services or challenge our rights to receive certain service payments. Our future revenue, costs, and capital investment could be adversely affected by material changes to or decisions regarding the applicability of government requirements, and we cannot assure you that future regulatory, judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nChanges in the composition and leadership of the FCC, state commissions and other agencies that regulate our business could have significant impacts on our revenue, expenses, competitive position and prospects. Changes in the composition and leadership of these agencies are often difficult to predict, which makes future planning more difficult.\nRisks associated with changes in regulation. Changes in regulation can have a material impact on our business, revenue or financial performance. Changes over the past couple of decades in federal regulations have substantially impacted our operations, including recent orders or laws overhauling intercarrier compensation, revamping universal service funding and increasing our responsibilities to assist various governmental agencies and safeguard customer data. These changes have significantly impacted various aspects of our operations, financial results and capital expenditures, including the amount of revenue we collect from our wholesale customers. We expect these impacts will continue in the future. For more information, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of this report, and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of this report.\nMany of the FCC\u2019s regulations adopted in recent years remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus increasing the difficulty of determining the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors.\nRisks of investigations and fines. Various governmental agencies have routinely in the past investigated our or our affiliates\u2019 business practices either in response to complaints or on their own initiative, and are expected to continue to do the same in the future. These investigations can potentially result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements or reputational harm, or could cause us to change our sales practices or operations. We typically publicly disclose the existence or outcome of these investigations, or our own internal investigations, only when we determine these disclosures to be material to investors or otherwise required by applicable law.\nRisks of higher costs. Regulations continue to create significant operating and capital costs for us. Regulatory challenges to our business practices or delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, such challenges could adversely affect our operations.\nOur business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to regulations or laws related to regulating broadband services, storing records, fighting crime, bolstering homeland security or cyber security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts, enhancing privacy, restricting data collection, protecting intellectual property rights of third parties, or addressing other issues that impact our business. We expect our compliance costs to increase if future laws or regulations continue to increase our obligations.\nRisks posed by other regulations. All of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental, safety, health and other governmental regulations. In connection with our current operations, we use, handle and dispose of various hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. In prior decades, certain of our current or former subsidiaries owned or operated, or are alleged to have owned or operated, former manufacturing businesses for which we have been notified of certain potential environmental liabilities. We monitor our compliance with applicable regulations or commitments governing these current and past activities. Although we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations in all material respects, our use, handling and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials, or the prior operations of our predecessors, could expose us to claims or actions that could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor a discussion of regulatory risks associated with our international operations, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business-Our international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\"\nRegulation of the Internet and data privacy could substantially impact us.\nSince the creation of the Internet, there has been extensive debate about whether and how to regulate Internet service providers. A significant number of U.S. congressional leaders, state elected officials and various consumer interest groups have long advocated in favor of extensive regulation. In 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulated broadband services as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC voted to repeal most of those regulations in December 2017 and preempted states from substantial regulations of their own. Opponents of the rescission judicially challenged this action and continue to advocate in favor of re-instituting extensive federal regulation. In addition, California and other states have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation or regulations that govern the terms of internet services. In October 2019, a federal court upheld the FCC\u2019s classification decision but vacated a part of its preemption ruling. The court also remanded to the FCC for further findings related to the classification decision. Numerous parties have sought further appellate review of this decision. The results of these further appeals are pending. Depending on the scope of such current and future federal or state regulation and judicial proceedings regarding these matters, the imposition of heightened regulation of our Internet operations could hamper our ability to operate our data networks efficiently, restrict our ability to implement network management practices necessary to ensure quality service, increase the cost of operating, maintaining and upgrading our network, and otherwise negatively impact our current operations. As the significance of the Internet continues to expand, foreign governments similarly may adopt new laws or regulations governing the Internet. We cannot predict the outcome of any such changes.\nA growing number of non-U.S. jurisdictions have adopted rigorous data privacy laws. For example, all current member states of the European Union have adopted new European data protection laws that have exposed our European operations to an increased risk of litigation and substantial regulatory fines. In the U.S., California and other states have adopted, or are considering adopting, comparable data privacy laws. These laws are complex and not consistent across jurisdictions. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of this growing trend toward additional regulation, we expect it will increase our operating costs and heighten our regulatory risk.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers or distributors distribute over our network.\nThe liability of private network operators for information stored or transmitted on their networks is impacted both by changing technology and evolving legal principles that remain unsettled in many jurisdictions. While we disclaim any liability for third-party content in our service contracts, as a private network provider we potentially could be exposed to legal claims relating to third party content stored or transmitted on our networks. Such claims could involve, among others, allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or aiding and abetting restricted activities such as online gambling or pornography. Although we believe our liability for these types of claims is limited, suits against other carriers have been successful and we cannot assure you that our defenses will prevail. If we decide to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to these risks, or if we are required to defend ourselves against these kinds of claims, our operations and financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur pending legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, the trading price of our securities and our ability to access the capital markets.\nThere are several material proceedings pending against us, as described in Note 17-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. We review our litigation accrual liabilities on a quarterly basis, but in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines only establish accrual liabilities when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable and only revise previously-established accrual liabilities when warranted by changes in circumstances, in each case based on then-available information. As such, as of any given date we could have exposure to losses under proceedings as to which no liability has been accrued or as to which the accrued liability is inadequate. For each of these reasons, any of the proceedings described in Note 17, as well as current litigation not described therein or future litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, operating results, the trading price of our securities and our ability to access the capital markets. We can give you no assurances as to the ultimate impact of these matters on us.\nWe are subject to franchising requirements that could impede our expansion opportunities or result in potential fines or penalties.\nWe may be required to obtain from municipal authorities operating franchises to install or expand certain facilities related to our fiber transport operations and certain of our other services. Some of these franchises may require us to pay franchise fees, and may require us to pay fines or penalties if we violate or terminate our related contractual commitments. In some cases, certain franchise requirements could delay us in expanding our operations or increase the costs of providing these services.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including any failure to timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls; could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or our reputation with investors, lenders or others.\nChanges in any of the above-described laws or regulations may limit our ability to plan, and could subject us to further costs or constraints.\nFrom time to time, the laws or regulations governing us or our customers, or the government\u2019s policy of enforcing those laws or regulations, have changed frequently and materially. The variability of these laws could hamper the ability of us and our customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Moreover, future changes in these laws or regulations could further increase our operating or compliance costs, or further restrict our operational flexibility, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position, financial condition or prospects.\nFor a more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of this report.\nRisks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur high debt levels expose us to a broad range of risks.\nWe continue to carry significant debt. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of our consolidated long-term debt was $10.1 billion, excluding unamortized premiums, net, unamortized debt issuance costs and finance leases. As of such date, $840 million aggregate principal amount of this long-term debt was scheduled to mature prior to December 31, 2022. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.\nOur significant levels of debt can adversely affect us in several respects, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancings or other general corporate purposes, particularly if, as discussed further in the risk factor disclosure below, (i) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward or (ii) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, distributions, stock repurchases, marketing and other potential growth initiatives;\n\u2022\nhindering our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to plan for or react to changing market, industry, competitive or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nincreasing our future borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nlimiting or precluding us from entering into commercial, hedging or other financial arrangements with vendors, customers or other business partners;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, or take other unfavorable actions to meet payment obligations; or\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we may not meet the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments, either of which could result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe effects of each of these factors could be intensified if we increase our borrowings.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, our variable-rate debt will have higher debt service requirements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition. If such rate increases are significant and sustained, these impacts could be material.\nAny failure to make required debt payments could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or raise capital.\nSubject to certain limitations, our debt agreements and the debt agreements of our subsidiaries allow us to incur additional debt, which could exacerbate the other risks described in this report.\nSubject to certain limitations and restrictions, the current terms of our debt instruments and the debt instruments of our subsidiaries permit us or them to incur additional indebtedness, including additional borrowings under CenturyLink's revolving credit facility. Incremental borrowings that impose additional financial risks could exacerbate the other risks described in this report.\nWe expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that we intend to refinance over the next several years, principally through the issuance of debt securities or term loans by CenturyLink or one or more of our principal subsidiaries. We may also need to obtain additional financing under a variety of other circumstances, including if:\n\u2022\nwe engage in additional acquisitions or undertake substantial capital projects or other initiatives that increase our cash requirements;\n\u2022\nwe become subject to significant judgments or settlements, including in connection with one or more of the matters discussed elsewhere herein; or\n\u2022\nwe otherwise require additional cash to fund our cash requirements described elsewhere herein.\nOur ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position, performance, and credit ratings, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by (i) general market conditions, such as disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, geo-political instabilities, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad and (ii) specific conditions in the communications industry. Instability in the domestic or global financial markets has from time to time resulted in periodic volatility and disruptions in the capital markets. Uncertainty regarding worldwide trade, the strength of various global and supranatural governing bodies and other geopolitical events could significantly affect global financial markets in 2020. Volatility in the global markets could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our credit facilities and other debt instruments, which are discussed further below.\nOur access to funds under CenturyLink's revolving credit facility is further dependent upon the ability of the facility\u2019s lenders to meet their funding commitments. Stricter capital-related and other regulations, particularly in the United States and Europe, could hamper the ability of these lenders to continue to fund their commitments. If one or more of the lenders fails to fund, the remaining lenders will not be legally obligated to rectify the funding shortfall.\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, we can give no assurance that additional financing for any of these purposes will be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to make required debt payments or refinance our debt, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, issuing additional securities, reducing or terminating our distributions, cutting or delaying costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our lenders to restructure our applicable debt. Our current and future debt instruments may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to complete some of these actions on favorable terms, or at all. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we could implement these steps in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. Moreover, any steps taken to strengthen our liquidity, such as cutting costs, could adversely impact our business or operations.\nWe have a highly complex debt structure, which could impact the rights of our investors.\nCenturyLink, Inc. and various of its subsidiaries owe substantial sums pursuant to various debt and financing arrangements, certain of which are guaranteed by other principal subsidiaries. Over half of the debt of CenturyLink, Inc. is guaranteed by nine of its principal domestic subsidiaries, six of which have pledged substantially all of their assets (including certain of their respective subsidiaries) to secure their guarantees. The remainder of the debt of CenturyLink, Inc. is neither secured by collateral nor guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries. Nearly half of the debt of our affiliate Level 3 Financing, Inc. is (i) secured by a pledge of substantially all of its assets and (ii) guaranteed on a secured basis by certain of its affiliates. The remainder of the debt of Level 3 Financing, Inc. is not secured by any of its assets, but is guaranteed by its parent. Substantial amounts of debt are also owed by two direct or indirect subsidiaries of Qwest Communications International Inc. and by Embarq Corporation and one of its subsidiaries. Most of the approximately 400 subsidiaries of CenturyLink, Inc. have neither borrowed money nor guaranteed any of the debt of CenturyLink, Inc. or its affiliates. As such, investors in our consolidated debt instruments should be aware that (i) determining the priority of their rights as creditors is a complex matter which is substantially dependent upon the assets and earning power of the entities that issued or guaranteed (if any) the applicable debt and (ii) a substantial portion of such debt is structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to the extent of the value of those subsidiaries that are obligors.\nOur various debt agreements include restrictions and covenants that could (i) limit our ability to conduct operations or borrow additional funds, (ii) restrict our ability to engage in inter-company transactions and (iii) lead to the acceleration of our repayment obligations in certain instances.\nUnder our and our affiliates' debt and financing arrangements, the issuer of the debt is subject to various covenants and restrictions, the most restrictive of which pertain to the debt of CenturyLink, Inc. and Level 3 Financing, Inc.\nCenturyLink's debt arrangements contain several significant limitations restricting its ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nborrow additional money or issue guarantees;\n\u2022\npay dividends or other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022\nmake loans, advances or other investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations.\nThese above-listed restrictive covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to operate or expand our business, to pursue strategic transactions, or to otherwise pursue our plans and strategies.\nThe debt and financing arrangements of Level 3 Financing, Inc. contain substantially similar limitations that restrict our operations on a standalone basis as a separate restricted group. Consequently, certain of these covenants may significantly restrict our ability to distribute cash from Level 3 to other of our affiliated entities, or to enter into other transactions among our affiliated entities.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\u2019s senior secured credit facilities also contain financial covenants that require it to maintain certain financial ratios, and the term loan debt of Qwest Corporation includes a similar financial covenant. The ability of CenturyLink, Inc. and Qwest Corporation to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control.\nIncreasingly in recent years, certain debt investors have sought to financially benefit themselves by identifying and seeking to enforce defaults under borrowers\u2019 debt agreements. This development could increase the risk of claims made under our debt agreements.\nThe failure of us or our affiliates to comply with the above-described restrictive or financial covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate their respective debt repayment obligations. Certain of our debt instruments have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. As noted elsewhere herein, we cannot assure you that we could adequately address any such defaults, cross-defaults or acceleration of our debt payment obligations in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. We expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. For additional information, see \u201cRisks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Note 6-Long-Term Debt.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings of us or our affiliates could limit our ability to obtain future financing, increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect the market price of our existing debt securities or otherwise impair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to the long-term debt of Level 3 Financing, Inc. Some of these ratings are below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d, which results in higher borrowing costs than \"investment grade\" debt as well as reduced marketability of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to any of these debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nA downgrade of any of these credit ratings could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nlimit our access to the capital markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\ntrigger the application of restrictive covenants or adverse conditions in our current or future debt agreements;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022\nimpair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information on the credit ratings of our secured and unsecured debt, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d in Item 7 of this report.\nUnder our debt agreements, a change of control of us or certain of our affiliates could have certain adverse ramifications.\nIf the credit ratings relating to certain currently outstanding long-term debt of Level 3 Financing, Inc. are downgraded in the manner specified thereunder in connection with a \u201cchange of control\u201d of Level 3 Financing or us, then Level 3 Financing could be required to offer to repurchase such debt securities. If, due to lack of cash, legal or contractual impediments, or otherwise, Level 3 Financing fails to offer to repurchase such debt, such failure could constitute an event of default under such debt . Any default under this debt could in turn constitute a default under other of our agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at that time. Moreover, the existence of these default or repurchase provisions may in certain circumstances render it more difficult or discourage certain sales transitions involving Level 3 Financing or us.\nOur business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduces our available free cash flow.\nOur business is capital intensive. We expect to continue to require significant cash to maintain, upgrade and expand our network infrastructure as a result of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in customers' service requirements, including increased demands by customers to transmit larger amounts of data at faster speeds;\n\u2022\nour above-described need to (i) consolidate and simplify our various legacy systems, (ii) strengthen and transform our customer support systems and (iii) support our development and launch of new products and services; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances of our competitors.\nWe may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to respond to these developments in a timely manner, at a commercially reasonable cost or on terms producing satisfactory returns on our investment.\nIn addition to investing in expanded networks, new products or new technologies, we must from time to time invest capital to (i) replace some of our aging equipment that supports many of our traditional services that are experiencing revenue declines or (ii) convert older systems to simplify and modernize our network. While we believe that our currently planned level of capital expenditures will meet both our maintenance and core growth requirements, this may not be the case if demands on our network continue to accelerate or other circumstances underlying our expectations change. Increased spending could, among other things, adversely affect our operating margins, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nSimilarly, we continue to anticipate incurring substantial operating expenses to support and maintain our operations. If we are unable to attain our objectives for managing or reducing these costs, our operating margins will be adversely impacted.\nAs a holding company, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their distribution of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate cash flows in amounts sufficient to fund our obligations, including the payment of our long-term debt. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us, except to the extent they have guaranteed such payments. Similarly, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing or cash management purposes, our subsidiaries have no obligation to make any funds available to us to repay our obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. Moreover, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors. In addition, the laws under which our subsidiaries were organized typically restrict the amount of dividends that they may pay. The ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds could be further restricted under applicable tax laws or orders imposed by state regulators (either in connection with obtaining necessary approvals for our acquisitions or in connection with our regulated operations). For all these reasons, you should not assume that our subsidiaries will be able in the future to generate and distribute to us cash in amounts sufficient to fund our cash requirements. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of these matters.\nOur current distribution practices could limit our ability to deploy cash for other beneficial purposes.\nThe current practice of our Board of Directors to pay distributions to our member reflects a current intention to distribute to our member a substantial portion of our cash flow. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to apply to other transactions that could be beneficial to our member or debtholders, including debt payments or capital expenditures that strengthen our business. In addition, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business through acquisitions or increased capital spending may depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing.\nWe cannot assure you whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards, or when they will be depleted.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $8.6 billion of federal net operating loss carryforwards, (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which for U.S. federal income tax purposes can be used to offset future taxable income. The majority of these NOLs are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d) and related Treasury regulations. It should be noted that issuances or sales of CenturyLink stock (including certain transactions outside of our control) could result in an ownership change of CenturyLink under Section 382, which may further limit our use of the NOLs. For these and other reasons, you should be aware that these limitations could restrict our ability to use these NOLs in the amounts we project or could limit our flexibility to pursue otherwise favorable transactions.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $9.2 billion. A significant portion of the state NOL carryforwards are generated in states where separate company income tax returns are filed and our subsidiaries that generated the losses may not have the ability to generate income in sufficient amounts to realize these losses. In addition, certain of these state NOL carryforwards will be limited by state laws related to ownership changes. As a result, we expect to utilize only a small portion of the state NOL carryforwards, and consequently have determined that as of December 31, 2019, these state NOL carryforwards, net of federal benefit, had a net tax benefit (after giving effect to our valuation allowance) of $249 million.\nAdditionally, we have foreign NOL carryforwards of $6.0 billion. A significant portion of the foreign NOL carryforwards are generated in subsidiaries that do not have a history of earnings and may not have the ability to generate income in sufficient amounts to realize the losses. As of December 31, 2019, we have determined that these foreign NOL carryforwards had net benefit of $235 million.\nEuropean Union regulation and reform of \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d including LIBOR, is ongoing and could have a material adverse effect on the value and return on our variable rate indebtedness.\nLIBOR and other interest rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of ongoing international regulatory reform in the European Union. Regulatory changes and the uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause market volatility or disruptions for variable-rate debt instruments. Any changes announced by regulators or any other governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted thereby, in the method of determining LIBOR rates may impact reported LIBOR rates, and thereby affect our interest costs. In addition, in mid-2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. Although we believe that our variable rate indebtedness provides for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the value of our variable rate indebtedness.\nOther Risks\nWe have lent money to CenturyLink, which exposes us to certain risks.\nAs of December 31, 2019, CenturyLink owed us $1.590 billion of the $1.825 billion we lent in late 2017. Developments that adversely impact CenturyLink could adversely impact our ability to collect this debt.\nWe face risks from natural disasters and extreme weather, which can disrupt our operations and cause us to incur substantial additional capital and operating costs.\nA substantial number of our facilities are located in coastal areas, which subjects them to the risks associated with severe tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, and many of our other facilities are subject to the risk of earthquakes, floods or other similar casualty events. These events could cause substantial damage, including flooded facilities, power outages, fuel shortages, damaged or destroyed property and equipment, and work interruptions. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance on our property (excluding our above ground outside plant) and may, under certain circumstances, be able to seek recovery of some additional costs through increased rates, only a portion of our additional costs directly related to such natural disasters have historically been recoverable. We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to obtain insurance for catastrophic hazard-related losses or, if obtainable and carried, whether this insurance will be adequate to cover such losses. In addition, we expect any insurance of this nature to be subject to substantial deductibles, retentions and coverage exclusions, and the premiums to be based on our loss experience. Moreover, many climate experts have predicted an increase in extreme weather events in the future, which would increase our exposure to casualty risks. For all these reasons, any future hazard-related costs and work interruptions could adversely affect our operations and our financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect the financial markets and our business.\nFuture terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly affect our physical facilities or those of our customers. These events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets and economy. Any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies or forward-looking statements, our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures could be materially affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, including the judgments, assumptions and estimates applied pursuant to our critical accounting policies, which are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7 of this report. If future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates applied in connection with preparing our historical financial statements, our future financial statements could be materially impacted.\nWhile frequently presented with numeric specificity, the guidance and other forward-looking statements that we disseminate from time to time is based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to our business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and speculative and are largely beyond our control. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our guidance or other forward-looking statements. Similarly, for a variety of reasons, we may change our intentions, strategies or plans at any time, which could materially alter our actual results from those previously anticipated. For additional information, see \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Item 1 of this report.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nWe maintain (i) disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the accuracy and completeness of our SEC reports and (ii) internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability and compliance with GAAP of our financial statements. We cannot assure you that these measures will be effective. As of December 31, 2018, we concluded that we had two material weaknesses relating to our accounting for the Level 3 combination and for revenue transactions. These material weaknesses caused us to file our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 after its original due date. Although we successfully remediated these material weaknesses during 2019, we cannot assure you that our remedial measures will avoid other control deficiencies in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. As a result, it is possible that our current or future financial statements or SEC reports may not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or other applicable requirements, will contain a material misstatement or omission, or will not be available on a timely basis, any of which could cause investors to lose confidence in us and lead to, among other things, unanticipated legal, accounting and other expenses, delays in filing required financial disclosures or reports, enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, fines, penalties, the delisting of our securities, liabilities arising from shareholder litigation, restricted access to the capital markets and lower valuations of our securities.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings and reduce our member's equity.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 51% of our total consolidated assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet included in this report consisted of goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, most of these intangible assets must be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. From time to time, including in the first quarter of 2019, CenturyLink and we recorded large non-cash charges to earnings in connection with required reductions of the value of its intangible assets. If our intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record additional significant, non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined to have occurred. Any such charges could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or ability to comply with financial covenants in our debt instruments.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will continue to have a substantial impact on us.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") enacted in December 2017 significantly changed U.S. tax law by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate and making certain changes to U.S. taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries, capital expenditures, interest expense and various other items. The net impact of this Act, as applied to date, has been unfavorable to us. However, the Act is quite complex and the impacts could potentially, further change as additional regulatory guidance is received from the Internal Revenue Service.\nAdditional changes in tax laws or tax audits could adversely affect us.\nLike all large multinational businesses, we are subject to multiple sets of complex and varying tax laws and rules. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government may from time to time change existing tax laws or regulations or enact new laws or regulations. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations that could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition. We are also subject to frequent and regular audits by a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local tax authorities. These audits could subject us to tax liabilities if adverse positions are taken by these tax authorities.\nWe believe that we have adequately provided for tax contingencies. However, our tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those that we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Because the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.\nAdverse developments impacting our non-consolidated affiliates could indirectly impact us.\nOur consolidated operations constitute only a portion of the consolidated operations of our corporate parent, CenturyLink. We engage in various intercompany transactions with affiliates of CenturyLink that are not members of our consolidated group of companies. Events or developments that adversely impact these non-consolidated affiliates will not directly impact our consolidated financial position or performance as reported under GAAP, but could nonetheless indirectly adversely impact us to the extent such developments interfere with the ability of such non-consolidated affiliates to provide services or pay amounts to which we or our subsidiaries are entitled. For these reasons, you are urged to review the risk factor disclosures contained in Item 1A of CenturyLink\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.", "PERMNO": 85991, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "LVLT"}
