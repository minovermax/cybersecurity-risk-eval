Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur product sale strategy is focused primarily on a subscription-based business model, and the success of this sales strategy depends on the continued adoption and use of our subscription-based products and services.\nOur success depends on growing market adoption by traditional and non-traditional providers and use of our subscription-based business model. Our subscription-based model may not be adopted by customers and potential customers at the rate we anticipate. Our ability to increase the number of customers who purchase our products and services or participate in our subscription-based programs and make our products a significant part of their practices, depends in part on the success of our direct sales and marketing programs. Before potential customers make a subscription-based purchase, they may need to recoup the cost of products that they have already purchased from competitors, and therefore they may decide to delay participating in our subscription-based programs or decide not to participate at all. If we are unable to increase market adoption and use of our products and services through our subscription-based model, the number of systems we sell may be lower than anticipated.\nOur subscription-based model exposes us to the credit risk of our customers over the life of the subscription agreement. In the event that our customers fail to make the monthly payments under their subscription agreements, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 54% and 67%, respectively, of our system revenues were derived from our subscription-based model. Although the ARTAS\u00ae System is not available under our subscription-based model, we expect that our subscription-based business model to continue to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. We collect an up-front fee, combined with a monthly payment schedule typically over a period of 36 months, with approximately 40% of total contract payments collected in the first year. For accounting purposes, these arrangements are considered to be sales-type finance leases, where the present value of all cash flows to be received under the subscription agreement is recognized as revenue upon shipment of the system to the customer. As part of our sales and marketing effort, we do not generally require our customers to undergo a formal credit check as is typically required with third-party equipment lease financing. Instead, to ensure that each monthly product payment is made on time and that the customer\u2019s systems are serviced in accordance with the terms of the warranty, every product requires a monthly activation code, which we provide to the customer upon receiving each monthly payment. If a customer does not pay a monthly installment in a timely manner, the customer will not receive an activation code and will be unable to use the system. While this process does not protect us from the economic impact of a customer\u2019s failure to make its monthly payments, we do maintain a purchase money security interest over the devices sold and therefore enjoy priority as a secured creditor, allowing us certain rights to recovery of the device in the event of a customer default or bankruptcy. We cannot provide any assurance that the financial position of customers purchasing products and services under a subscription agreement will not change adversely before we receive all of the monthly installment payments due under the contract. As a result of the global economic turmoil that has resulted from COVID-19, many of our customers are experiencing difficulty in making timely payments or payments at all during this pandemic under their subscription agreements which has resulted in higher than anticipated bad debt expense over the course of the 2020 fiscal year. In our largest subscription markets we collected approximately 60% of our billings in March 2020, 30% in April 2020, 35% in May 2020, 60% in June 2020, 104% in July 2020, 97% in August 2020, 98% in September 2020, 86% in October 2020, 86% in November 2020, and 87% in December 2020. We cannot assure you that our customers will resume payments under their agreements or that we will not experience customer defaults even after local economies reopen for business. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers to whom we have sold systems under the subscription-based model, we may recognize bad debt expenses in our general and administrative expenses. If this bad debt expense is material, it could negatively affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nWe offer credit terms to some qualified customers and distributors. In the event that any of these customers default on the amounts payable to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our subscription-based model, we generally offer credit terms of 30 to 60 days to qualified customers and distributors. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers or distributors to whom we have provided credit terms, we may recognize bad debt expenses in our general and administrative expenses. If this bad debt expense is material, it could negatively affect our future results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, in the event of deterioration of general business conditions, we may be subject to increased risk of non-payment of our accounts receivables. We may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers, distributors, and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of accounts receivable or a reduction of accounts receivables collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debt expenses.\nOur competitors may emulate our subscription-based model and erode our competitive advantage.\nOur subscription-based model allows us to penetrate new markets and access a broader customer base because it offers an alternative to traditional equipment lease financing. However, to the extent we continue to be successful in growing the market adoption of our products through our subscription-based model, competitors may seek to emulate this model. Although we believe that our products compete effectively with the products offered by our competitors, our customers may be more willing to purchase the products of our competitors if they were offered through a subscription-based model. If customers decide to use the products of our competitors instead of our systems, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nOur recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had recurring net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, and until we generate revenue at a level to support our cost structure, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and net cash outflows. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $157.4 million and $75.7 million, respectively. Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, meaning that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. In order to continue our operations, we must achieve profitable operations and/or obtain additional equity or debt financing. However, given the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot anticipate the extent to which the current economic turmoil and financial market conditions, will continue to adversely impact our business and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our future operations and to access the capital markets sooner than we planned. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our operations and planned capital or research and development expenditures or sell certain assets, including intellectual property assets. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nGlobal business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our business. In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China developed into a global pandemic and has resulted in multiple extended shutdowns of businesses in North and South America, Europe and Asia Pacific and gradual re-openings of economies. Global health concerns, such as the coronavirus pandemic, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we, or the third parties with whom we engage, operate. We cannot presently predict the scope and ultimate severity or duration of the coronavirus pandemic and related business and economic disruptions. While we experienced some recovery and positive sales trends throughout the second half of fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic and commercial shutdowns to date have materially and negatively impacted our ability to conduct business in the manner planned. Disruptions to our business include restrictions on the ability of our sales and marketing personnel and distributors to travel and sell our systems, disruptions of our global supply chain, disruptions in manufacturing, reduced demand and/or suspension of operations by our customers which has impacted their ability to make monthly subscription payments, and the deferral of aesthetic or hair restoration procedures. Our customers\u2019 patients are also affected by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Elective aesthetic procedures are less of a priority than other items for those patients who have lost their jobs, are furloughed, have reduced work hours or have to allocate their cash to other priorities. While we are encouraged by sales trends and economic recoveries we are seeing in international markets where COVID-19 vaccinations rates are high, we expect COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect customer demand throughout the first half of 2021. While we expect continued recovery in many markets in the first half of the year, recoveries have been gradual and the impact of COVID-19 on our sales could still be significant, especially if there is a resurgence of the virus in major markets. We do not yet know the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity in the future will depend on future developments which are evolving and highly uncertain including the duration of the outbreak, the severity of resurgences of the virus, travel restrictions, business and workforce disruptions, the timing of and extent of reopening the economic regions in which we do business and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. The outbreak of contagious diseases or the fear of such an outbreak could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our systems. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur loan and security agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility to effectively operate our business.\nCNB Loan Agreement\nOn August 29, 2018, Venus Concept Ltd. entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement as a guarantor with City National Bank of Florida (\u201cCNB\u201d), as amended on March 20, 2020 and December 9, 2020 (the \u201cCNB Loan Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which CNB agreed to make certain loans and other financial accommodations to certain of Venus Concept Ltd.\u2019s subsidiaries. In connection with the CNB Loan Agreement, Venus Concept Ltd. also entered into a Guaranty Agreement with CNB dated as of August 29, 2018, as amended on March 20, 2020 and December 9, 2020 (the \u201cCNB Guaranty\u201d), pursuant to which Venus Concept Ltd. agreed to guaranty the obligations of its subsidiaries under the CNB Loan Agreement. On March 20, 2020, we also entered into a Security Agreement with CNB (the \u201cCNB Security Agreement\u201d), as amended on December 9, 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to grant CNB a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the obligations under the CNB Loan Agreement. For additional details of the CNB Loan Agreement, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 12 \u201cCredit Facility\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAmong other things, the CNB Loan Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions and requires that a minimum of $23.0 million in cash be held in a deposit account maintained with CNB for one year following the closing of the CNB Loan Agreement. The Madryn Noteholders (defined below) have agreed to hold $20.0 million in cash in an escrow account at CNB, and pursuant to an escrow agreement, such cash will be released back to the Madryn Noteholders on the first anniversary of the CNB Loan Agreement. We are required to maintain $3.0 million in cash in a deposit account maintained with CNB at all times during the term of the CNB Loan Agreement. After the first anniversary of the CNB Loan Agreement, a minimum of $3.0 million in cash must be held in a deposit account maintained with CNB.\nThe CNB Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of certain of our subsidiaries and requires us to maintain either a minimum cash balance in deposit accounts or a maximum total liability to tangible net worth ratio and a minimum debt service coverage ratio. An event of default under the CNB Loan Agreement would cause a default under the Notes and the MSLP Loan Agreement, each as described below, provided that a waiver of each default by CNB will also result in the termination of the corresponding default in the Notes.\nUpon the occurrence, and during the continuance of, an event of default under the CNB Loan Agreement, if we are unable to repay all outstanding amounts, CNB may foreclose on the collateral granted to it to collateralize the indebtedness, which includes the enforcement of the CNB Security Agreement, which would significantly affect our ability to operate our business.\nMain Street Priority Lending Program Term Loan\nOn December 8, 2020, Venus USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, executed a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cMSLP Loan Agreement\u201d), a Promissory Note (the \u201cMSLP Note\u201d), and related documents for a loan in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million for which CNB will serve as lender pursuant to the Main Street Priority Loan Facility as established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (the \u201cMSLP Loan\u201d). Venus USA\u2019s obligations under the MSLP Loan will be secured pursuant to a Guaranty of Payment and Performance dated as of December 8, 2020 (the \u201cGuaranty Agreement\u201d), by and between the Company and CNB. On December 9, 2020, we were advised that the MSLP Loan had been funded and the transaction closed. For additional details of the MSLP Loan Agreement, see Note 10 \u201cMain Street Term Loan\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe MSLP Note provides for customary events of default, including, among others, those relating to a failure to make payment, bankruptcy, breaches of representations and covenants, and the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the MSLP Loan Agreement and MSLP Note contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to limited exceptions, these covenants limit our ability, without CNB\u2019s consent, to, among other things, sell, lease, transfer, exclusively license or dispose of our assets, incur, create or permit to exist additional indebtedness, or liens, to make dividends and other restricted payments, and to make certain changes to our ownership structure.\nMadryn Credit Agreement and Exchange Agreement\nOn October 11, 2016, Venus Concept Ltd. entered into a credit agreement as a guarantor with Madryn Health Partners, LP, as administrative agent, and certain of its affiliates as lenders (collectively, \u201cMadryn\u201d), as amended (the \u201cMadryn Credit Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Madryn agreed to make certain loans to certain of Venus Concept\u2019s subsidiaries.\nContemporaneously with the MSLP Loan Agreement, the Company, Venus USA, Venus Concept Canada Corp., Venus Concept Ltd., and the Madryn Noteholders (as defined below), entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the \u201cExchange Agreement\u201d) dated as of December 8, 2020, pursuant to which the Company (i) repaid on December 9, 2020, $42.5 million aggregate principal amount owed under the Madryn Credit Agreement, and (ii) issued, on December 9, 2020, to the Madryn Health Partners (Cayman Master), LP and Madryn Health Partners, LP (the \u201cMadryn Noteholders\u201d) secured subordinated convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $26.7 million (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Madryn Credit Agreement was terminated effective December 9, 2020 upon the funding and closing of the MSLP Loan and the issuance of the Notes. For additional information regarding the Madryn Credit Agreement, the Exchange Agreement and the Notes, see Note 11 \u201cMadryn Long-Term Debt and Convertible Notes\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nPursuant to the Madryn Security Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Madryn Notes, if we are unable to repay all outstanding amounts, the Madryn Noteholders may, subject to the terms of the CNB Subordination Agreement, foreclose on the collateral granted to it to collateralize the indebtedness, including the enforcement of the Madryn Security Agreement, which will significantly affect our ability to operate our business. Additionally, the Madryn Security Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to limited exceptions, these covenants limit our ability, without the Madryn Noteholders\u2019 consent, to, among other things, incur, create or permit to exist additional indebtedness, or liens, and to make certain changes to our ownership structure. The Madryn Security Agreement also contains a covenant which requires that if we or any of our subsidiaries that has guaranteed the Notes consummates a disposition of material assets the result of which is that less than 50% of the consolidated net tangible assets of such entities secure the Notes then, within 90 days thereafter, we and our subsidiaries party to the Madryn Security Agreement must provide certain additional collateral so that more than 50% of the consolidated net tangible assets of the Company and its subsidiaries which have guaranteed the Notes will be collateral securing the Notes.\nIf an Event of Default occurs, then, the Madryn Noteholders may, subject to the terms of the CNB Subordination Agreement, (i) declare the outstanding principal amount of Notes, all accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts owing under the Notes and other transaction documents entered into in connection therewith to be immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person and (ii) exercise all rights and remedies available to it under the Notes, the Madryn Security Agreement and any other document entered into in connection with the foregoing.\nIf we default on our loans secured under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, we may default on our CNB Loan Agreement and/or MSLP Loan.\nWe and one of our subsidiaries received an aggregate of $4.1 million in funding in connection with two \u201cSmall Business Loans\u201d under the federal Paycheck Protection Program provided in Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, as amended from time to time. We and our subsidiary, Venus Concept USA, entered into U.S. Small Business Administration Notes pursuant to which we borrowed $1.7 million original principal amount (the \u201cVenus Concept PPP Loan\u201d) and Venus Concept USA borrowed $2.4 million original principal amount (the \u201cVenus USA PPP Loan\u201d and together with the Venus Concept PPP Loan, individually each a \u201cPPP Loan\u201d and collectively, the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d). For additional details of the PPP Loans, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this report.\nThe PPP Loans contain certain covenants which, among other things, restrict our use of the proceeds of the respective PPP Loan to the payment of payroll costs, interest on mortgage obligations, rent obligations and utility expenses, require compliance with all other loans or other agreements with any creditor of us or Venus Concept USA, to the extent that a default under any loan or other agreement would materially affect our or Venus Concept USA\u2019s ability to repay its respective PPP Loan and limit our ability to make certain changes to our ownership structure.\nIf we and/or Venus Concept USA defaults on our or its respective PPP Loan (i) events of default will occur under the CNB Loan Agreement and MSLP Loan, and (ii) we and/or Venus Concept USA may be required to immediately repay their respective PPP Loan.\nAlso, the SBA has decided, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, that it will request additional information from the borrower on all loans in excess of $2.0 million following the lender\u2019s submission of the borrower\u2019s loan forgiveness application. To the extent that the SBA\u2019s review of the additional information determines that Venus Concept USA\u2019s self-certification of the PPP loan was not appropriate, the loan may not be forgiven, an event of default would occur under the CNB Loan Agreement and MSLP Loan and Venus Concept USA could be subject to civil and criminal penalties.\nWe will require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, commercialization and other operations or efforts.\nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development and sales and marketing activities. Research and development, clinical trials, product engineering, ongoing product upgrades and other enhancements and seeking regulatory clearances and approvals to market future products will require substantial funds to complete. As of December 31, 2020, we had capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of approximately $34.4 million. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the ongoing commercializing of our systems, increasing our sales and marketing efforts, and continuing research and development and product enhancements activities.\nWhile we believe that the net proceeds from our December 2020 public offering, our March 2020 private placement, the proceeds from sales of our common stock to Lincoln Park and the proceeds from the PPP Loans and other government assistance programs, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, the savings from our Merger-related cost savings initiatives and our new restructuring program, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. The impact of COVID-19 on our business has been significant and we cannot predict the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact our business. Also, we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations sooner than expected or otherwise implement additional cost-saving initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic and the economic turmoil it has caused has negatively affected the global financial markets which may make it difficult to access the public markets. Any such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, the issuance of securities that may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, the imposition of more burdensome debt covenants and repayment obligations, the licensing of rights to our technology or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital if favorable market conditions exist or given other strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our current or future operating plans.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u2022\ndelay or curtail our efforts to develop system product enhancements or new products, including any clinical trials that may be required to market such enhancements;\n\u2022\ndelay or curtail our plans to increase and expand our sales and marketing efforts; or\n\u2022\ndelay or curtail our plans to enhance our customer support and marketing activities.\nWe are restricted by covenants in the Madryn Security Agreement, CNB Loan Agreement, the PPP Loans and other government assistance programs. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing.\nWe will need to continue to incur significant expenses to grow our business, which could negatively affect our future profitability.\nIn order to grow our business and increase revenues, we will need to introduce and commercialize new products, grow our sales and marketing force, implement new software systems, as well as identify and penetrate new markets. Such endeavors have in the past increased, and may continue in the future to increase, our expenses, including sales and marketing and research and development. We will have to continue to increase our revenues while effectively managing our expenses in order to achieve profitability and to sustain it. Our failure to control expenses could make it difficult to achieve profitability or to sustain profitability in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our expenditures will result in the successful development and introduction of new products in a cost-effective and timely manner or that any such new products will achieve market acceptance and generate revenues for our business.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe cost of growing our ongoing commercialization and sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacturing and maintaining enough inventories of our systems and consumables to meet anticipated demand and inventory write-offs related to obsolete products or components;\n\u2022\nthe costs of enhancing the existing functionality and development of new functionalities for our systems;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u2022\nany product liability or other lawsuits and the costs associated with defending them or the results of such lawsuits;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with conducting business and maintaining subsidiaries and other entities in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncustomers in jurisdictions where our systems are not approved delaying their purchase, and not purchasing our systems, until they are approved or cleared for use in their market;\n\u2022\nthe costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company.\nOur budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenue from systems sales, product sales and servicing and procedure-based fees. We may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenue. Accordingly, a significant shortfall in market acceptance or demand for our systems and procedures could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nBecause we incur a substantial portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and inflation.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 53% and 47%, respectively, of our global revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars and our reporting currency was the U.S. dollar. We pay a meaningful portion of our expenses in NIS, CAD, and other foreign currencies. Expenses in NIS and CAD accounted for 17% and 9%, respectively, of our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 21% and 14%, respectively, of our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. Salaries paid to our employees, general and administrative expenses and general sales and related expenses are paid in many different currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the currency fluctuation risks relating to the denomination of its future revenues in U.S. dollars. More specifically, if the U.S. dollar devalues against the CAD or the NIS, our CAD and NIS denominated expenses will be greater than anticipated when reported in U.S. dollars. Inflation in Israel compounds the adverse impact of such devaluation by further increasing the amount of our Israeli expenses. Israeli inflation may also in the future outweigh the positive effect of any appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the CAD and the NIS, if, and to the extent that, it outpaces such appreciation or precedes such appreciation. We generally do not engage in currency hedging to protect the Company from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the CAD, NIS, and other foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar (and/or from inflation of such foreign currencies), and we may be exposed to material adverse effects from such movements. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of devaluation (if any) of the U.S. dollar or any other currency against the NIS or CAD.\nDownturns in the economy or economic uncertainty may reduce patient and customer demand for our systems and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Furthermore, the aesthetic industry in which we operate is particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic trends. Treatments using our systems involves elective procedures, the cost of which must be borne by patients, and is not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. Economic uncertainty may reduce patient demand for the procedures performed using our systems; if there is not sufficient patient demand for the procedures for which our systems are used, practitioner demand for these systems could drop, negatively impacting operating results. The decision to undergo a procedure using our systems is driven by consumer demand. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, individuals generally reduce the amount of money that they spend on discretionary items, including aesthetic procedures. If our customers\u2019 patients face economic hardships, our business would be negatively impacted, and our financial performance would be materially harmed in the event that any of the above factors discourage patients from seeking the procedures for which our systems are used. A weak or declining economy could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay or stop making payments for our systems or services. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the economic turmoil that has resulted, we expect that some of our customers will continue to experience difficulty in making timely payments or payments at all under their subscription agreements. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the economic climate and financial market conditions, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely impact our business. The impact of economic uncertainty on our industry may vary from region to region.\nIt is difficult to forecast our future performance and our financial results may fluctuate unpredictably.\nThe rapid evolution of the markets for medical technologies and aesthetic products makes it difficult for us to predict our future performance. Several factors, many of which are outside of our control, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results, such as:\n\u2022\nvariations in market demand for our systems and services from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022\ndelays in purchasing decisions in jurisdictions where our systems are not approved, and decisions not to purchase our systems until they are approved or cleared for use in a particular market;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our customers to obtain the necessary financing to purchase our products which may not be available under our subscription-based model;\n\u2022\ncustomers operating under our subscription-based program may slow down or stop paying their monthly contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nperformance of new functionalities and system updates;\n\u2022\nperformance of our international distributors or local partners;\n\u2022\npositive or negative media coverage of our systems, positive or negative patient experiences, the procedures or products of our competitors, or our industry generally;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our current, or obtain further, regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity;\n\u2022\ndelays in, or failure of, product and component deliveries by our third-party manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nseasonal or other variations in patient demand for aesthetic procedures;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new medical aesthetic procedures or products and services that compete with our products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules that may cause restatement of our consolidated financial statements or have other adverse effects; and\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the economy that reduce patient demand for elective aesthetic procedures.\nThe historic seasonality of our industry and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and stock price and make it difficult to compare our results of operations to prior periods and predict future financial results.\nWe believe that our business is affected by seasonal and other trends. Specifically, we believe our business is affected by seasonal trends during the summer months in the United States and Europe due to vacations taken by physician customers and their patients, as well as fluctuations in operating results due to uneven timing of distributor and corporate account orders and marketing into new geographic regions. In addition, there is typically a substantial increase in sales in the last two months of the year, which translates to a strong fourth quarter followed by some weakness in the following first quarter of the next fiscal year. It is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which these factors may make our revenue unpredictable in the future, and these seasonal and other trends may continue to lead to fluctuations in quarterly operating results. As a result of these factors, future fluctuations in quarterly results could cause our revenue and cash flows to be below analyst and investor expectations, which could cause decline in our stock price. Due to future fluctuations in revenue and costs, as well as other potential fluctuations, you should not rely upon our operating results in any period as an indication of future performance.\nOur ability to grow revenue partially depends on growing physician adoption and use of our systems and adoption by physicians in non-traditional specialty areas.\nAesthetic and hair restoration procedures are performed primarily by physicians who practice dermatology or plastic surgery. Our success depends on the growth of aesthetic and hair restoration procedures performed by physicians other than dermatologists and plastic surgeons, and aesthetic procedures performed by general and family practitioners and aesthetic medical spas. Our ability to increase the number of physicians willing to make a significant capital expenditure to purchase our systems or participate in our subscription program and make them a significant part of their practices, depends on the success of our sales and marketing programs. We must be able to demonstrate that the cost of our systems and the revenue that a physician can derive from performing procedures are compelling when compared to the costs and revenue associated with alternative aesthetic treatments the physician can offer and persuade physicians to purchase our systems instead of those of our competitors, many of whom already have existing relationships with our target physicians. In addition, we believe our marketing programs, including clinical support, will be critical to increasing utilization and awareness of our systems, particularly the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems, but these programs require physician commitment and involvement to succeed. We must also be successful in persuading physicians in non-traditional specialties to introduce procedures performed with our systems into their practices. If we are unable to increase adoption and use of our systems by physicians in other non-traditional specialties, our growth and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends upon patient satisfaction with our procedures. If there is not sufficient patient demand for our procedures, our financial results and future prospects will be negatively impacted.\nOur procedures are elective aesthetic procedures, the cost of which must be borne by the patient and is not covered by or reimbursable through government or private health insurance. In order to generate repeat and referral business, patients must be satisfied with the effectiveness of the procedures conducted using our systems. The decision to undergo one of our procedures is thus driven by patient demand, which may be influenced by a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nthe success of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our physician customers recommend our procedures to their patients;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our procedures satisfy patient expectations;\n\u2022\nour ability to properly train our physician customers in the use of our systems so that their patients do not experience excessive discomfort during treatment or adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nthe cost, safety, and effectiveness of our systems versus other aesthetic treatments;\n\u2022\nconsumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and our systems in particular;\n\u2022\nthe success of any direct-to-consumer marketing efforts we may initiate; and\n\u2022\ngeneral consumer confidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions outside of our control.\nOur financial performance will be negatively impacted in the event we cannot generate significant patient demand for procedures performed with our systems.\nWe compete against companies that offer alternative solutions to our systems, or have greater resources, a larger installed base of customers and broader product offerings than we have. If we are not able to effectively compete with these companies and alternative solutions, our business may not continue to grow.\nThe medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. Demand for our systems is impacted by the products and procedures offered by our competitors. Certain of our systems also compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion. In the United States, we compete against companies that have developed minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic procedures. Outside of the United States, likely due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are more aesthetic products and procedures available in international markets than are cleared for use in the United States. Sometimes, there are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we may face a greater number of competitors in markets outside of the United States.\nWe also compete generally with medical technology and aesthetic companies, including those offering products and products unrelated to skin treatment. Aesthetic industry consolidations have created combined entities with greater financial resources, deeper sales channels, and greater pricing flexibility than ours. Rumored or actual consolidation of our competitors could cause uncertainty and disruption to our business. In the surgical hair restoration market, we consider our direct competition to be FUT Strip Surgeries and Manual FUE procedures. Many of our surgical device and equipment competitors have greater capital resources, sales and marketing operations and service infrastructures than we do, as well as longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians. Our indirect competition in the hair restoration market also includes non-surgical treatments for hair loss, such as prescription therapeutics, including Propecia, and non-prescription remedies, such as wigs, hair pieces and spray-on applications. Some of these companies have greater resources than we do, a broad range of product offerings, large direct sales forces, and long-term customer relationships with the physicians we target, which could make our market penetration efforts more difficult. Competition in the medical technology and aesthetic hair restoration markets could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins, and limited market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to establish or strengthen our brand.\nWe believe that establishing and strengthening our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our systems, particularly because of the highly competitive nature of the market for aesthetic treatments and procedures. Promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide physicians with reliable systems and services. Given the established nature of our competitors, it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur significant expenses. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased sales and, even if they do, any sales increases may not offset the expenses we incur to promote our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, systems may not achieve adequate acceptance by physicians, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe aesthetic equipment market is characterized by rapid innovation. Our inability to develop and/or acquire new products and services, obtain regulatory clearance and maintain regulatory compliance, market new products successfully, and identify new markets for our technology may cause us to fail to compete effectively.\nThe aesthetic energy-based treatment equipment and hair restoration markets are subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If we do not continue to innovate and develop new products, services and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products, applications and services or enhancements to current products. To continue to grow in the future, we must continue to develop and/or acquire new and innovative aesthetic and medical products, services and applications, identify new markets, and successfully launch any newly developed or acquired product offerings.\nTo successfully expand our product and service offerings, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop or otherwise acquire new products that either add to, or significantly improve, our current product offerings;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory clearance for and adhere to regulatory requirements relating to new products;\n\u2022\nconvince existing and prospective customers that our product offerings are an attractive revenue-generating addition to their practice;\n\u2022\nsell our product offerings to a broad customer base;\n\u2022\nidentify new markets and alternative applications for our technology;\n\u2022\nprotect existing and future products with defensible intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nsatisfy and maintain all regulatory requirements for commercialization.\nHistorically, product introductions have been a significant component of our financial performance. To be successful in the medical aesthetics industry, we believe we need to continue to innovate. Our business strategy is based, in part, on our expectation that we will continue to increase or enhance our product offerings. We need to continue to devote substantial research and development resources to introduce new products, which can be costly and time-consuming to our organization.\nWe also believe that, to increase revenue from sales of new products, we need to continue to develop our clinical support, further expand and nurture relationships with industry thought leaders, and increase market awareness of the benefits of our new products. However, even with a significant investment in research and development, we may be unable to continue to develop, acquire or effectively launch and market new products and technologies regularly, or at all. If we fail to successfully innovate and commercialize new products or enhancements, our business may be harmed.\nWe may be unsuccessful in penetrating certain international markets through majority-owned subsidiary arrangements with local partners.\nWe have established several majority-owned subsidiaries in international markets as part of our international growth strategy. Although we select our local partners based on demonstrated experience and expertise in the local aesthetic market, the nature of our arrangements with local partners requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. We may not be able to identify local partners with the requisite experience and expertise in their local markets or successfully negotiate an agreement with such local partners. Moreover, the ability of these subsidiaries to execute their business plans depends on the local partners fulfillment of their obligations. If local partners fail to fulfill their obligations to our satisfaction, our financial results could be adversely affected, and we may be required to either increase our level of commitment to the subsidiary and dedicate additional resources or divest our interest in the subsidiary. Although our agreements with our local partners generally allow us control over business operations, differences in views could also result in delayed execution of the subsidiary\u2019s business plan. If these differences cause a subsidiary to deviate from our business plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding and managing our direct sales and marketing forces effectively.\nWe rely on our own direct sales force and in-house marketing department to sell our systems and services in North America and in international markets. In order to meet our anticipated sales objectives, we expect to continue to grow our global sales and marketing organization over the next several years. There are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales and marketing organization, including risks related to our ability to:\n\u2022\nhire qualified individuals as needed;\n\u2022\ngenerate sufficient leads within our target customer group for our sales force;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training for the effective sale and marketing of our systems and services;\n\u2022\nretain and motivate our direct sales and marketing professionals;\n\u2022\neffectively oversee geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams; and\n\u2022\nwork successfully with local partners of our majority-owned subsidiaries.\nOur failure to adequately address these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales and use of our systems and services, which would cause our revenues to be lower than expected and harm our results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party distributors to market and sell our systems in certain markets.\nIn addition to a direct sales and marketing forces, we currently depend on third-party distributors to sell, market, and service our systems in certain markets outside of North America and to train our customers in these markets. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated 7% and 6%, respectively, of our systems revenues from sales made through third-party distributors. Our agreements with third-party distributors set forth minimum quarterly purchase commitments required for each distributor and provide the distributor the right to distribute its systems within a designated territory. As we continue to expand into new markets outside of North America, we will need to engage additional third-party distributors which exposes us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of day-to-day control over the activities of third-party distributors;\n\u2022\nthird-party distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market, sell, train, support and service our systems to the level of our expectations;\n\u2022\nthird-party distributors may emphasize the sale of third-party products over our products;\n\u2022\nthird-party distributors may not be as selective as we would be in choosing customers to purchase our systems or as effective in training physicians in marketing and patient selection;\n\u2022\nthird-party distributors may violate applicable laws and regulations, which may limit our ability to sell products in certain markets; and\n\u2022\ndisagreements with our distributors that could require or result in costly and time-consuming litigation or arbitration, which we could be required to conduct in jurisdictions in which we are not familiar with the governing law.\nOur expanded use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges, which, if not managed properly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have implemented a robust business to business and business to customer public relations outreach strategy that incorporates both digital media and top national publications. In addition, as part of our practice enhancing services, we provide customers with post sale marketing and practice management support to assist the growth of their practices. Negative posts or comments about us or any of our brands on any social networking website could seriously damage our reputation. In addition, the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information.\nEconomic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business.\nSales in markets outside of the United States accounted for approximately 56% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 57% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the majority of our research and development activities and the manufacture of our systems are located outside of the United States. As a result of our international business, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u2022\nincreased competition as a result of more products and procedures receiving regulatory approval or otherwise free to market in international markets;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions, trade regulations, and non-U.S. tax laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nforeign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u2022\ncustoms clearance and shipping delays;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general and uncertainties related to the coronavirus;\n\u2022\npreference for locally manufactured products;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards; and\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.\nIf one or more of these risks were realized, it could require us to dedicate significant financial and management resources, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our hair restoration business depends upon the success of the ARTAS\u00ae System and ARTAS\u00ae iX System, which has a limited commercial history. If we are unsuccessful in developing the market for robotic hair restoration or the market acceptance for the ARTAS\u00ae System and ARTAS\u00ae iX System fails to grow significantly, our business and future prospects will be negatively impacted.\nWe commenced commercial sales of the ARTAS\u00ae System for hair follicle dissection in the United States in 2011. Consequently, we lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of the ARTAS\u00ae System and the benefits it offers that might have been generated in connection with other hair restoration techniques. As a result, physicians may be slow to adopt the ARTAS\u00ae System, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. If we choose to, or are required to, conduct additional studies, such studies or experience could slow the market adoption of the ARTAS\u00ae System by physicians and significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue from this system.\nOur success in the hair restoration market depends on the acceptance among physicians and patients of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems as the preferred system for performing hair restoration surgery. Acceptance of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems by physicians is significantly dependent on our ability to convince physicians of the benefits of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems to their practices and, accordingly, develop the market for robotic-assisted hair restoration surgery. Acceptance of the ARTAS\u00ae procedure by patients is equally important as patient demand will influence physicians to offer the ARTAS\u00ae procedure, and the degree of market acceptance of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems by physicians and patients is unproven. We believe that market acceptance of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe perceived advantages or disadvantages of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems relative to other hair restoration products and treatments;\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems relative to other hair restoration products and treatments;\n\u2022\nthe price of the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems relative to other hair restoration products and treatments;\n\u2022\nour success in expanding and integrating our hair restoration sales and marketing organization;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing, advertising, and commercialization initiatives;\n\u2022\nour success in adding new functionalities to the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems and enhancing existing functions; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory clearance to market the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems for additional treatment indications in the United States.\nFurther, the ARTAS\u00ae iX System, which was launched in July 2018, includes our recently cleared robotic implantation functionality. As this functionality is relatively new, it is possible that it could include defaults, \u201cbugs\u201d or present other technical issues which could prompt potential physician customers to delay their purchase of the ARTAS\u00ae iX System or could prompt physicians that have purchased the ARTAS\u00ae iX System to either return or not utilize the system.\nWe cannot assure you that the ARTAS\u00ae System or ARTAS\u00ae iX System will achieve broad market acceptance among physicians and patients. As we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue in the hair restoration market from ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems sales, servicing and procedure-based fees, any failure of this product to satisfy physician or patient demand or to achieve meaningful market acceptance will harm our business and future prospects.\nOur inability to effectively compete with competitive hair restoration treatments or procedures may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration in the hair restoration market or improving our operating results.\nWe designed the ARTAS\u00ae System to assist physicians in performing follicular unit extraction surgery. Demand for the ARTAS\u00ae Systems and ARTAS\u00ae procedures could be limited by other products and technologies. Competition to address hair loss comes from various sources, including:\n\u2022\ntherapeutic options including Rogaine, which is applied topically, and Propecia, which is ingested, both of which have been approved by the FDA;\n\u2022\nnon-surgical options, such as wigs, hair-loss concealer sprays and similar products; and\n\u2022\nother surgical alternatives, including hair transplantation surgery using the strip surgery method or using manual hand-held devices.\nSurgical alternatives to the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems may be able to compete more effectively than the ARTAS\u00ae procedure in established practices with trained staff and workflows built around performing these surgical alternatives. Practices experienced in offering FUT Strip Surgery or manual FUE using hand-held devices may be reluctant to incorporate or convert their practices to offer ARTAS\u00ae procedures due to the effort involved to make such changes.\nThese alternative options may be able to provide satisfactory results for male hair loss, generally at a lower cost to the patient than the ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems. As a result, if patients choose these competitive alternatives, our results of operation could be adversely affected.\nWe are the subject of purported class action lawsuits, and additional litigation may be brought against us in the future.\nBetween May 23, 2018 and June 11, 2019, four putative shareholder class actions complaints were filed against us, certain of our former officers and directors, certain of our venture capital investors, and the underwriters of our IPO. Two of these complaints, Wong v. Restoration Robotics, Inc., et al., No. 18CIV02609, and Li v. Restoration Robotics, Inc., et al., No. 19CIV08173 (together, the \u201cState Actions\u201d), were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, and assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act. The other two complaints, Guerrini v. Restoration Robotics, Inc., et al., No. 5:18-cv-03712-EJD and Yzeiraj v. Restoration Robotics, Inc., et al., No. 5:18-cv-03883-BLF (together, the \u201cFederal Actions\u201d), were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and assert claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. The complaints all allege, among other things, that our Registration Statement filed with the SEC on September 1, 2017 and the Prospectus filed with the SEC on October 13, 2017 in connection with our IPO were inaccurate and misleading, contained untrue statements of material facts, omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and omitted to state material facts required to be stated therein. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages, other equitable relief and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nIn addition to the State and Federal Actions, on July 11, 2019, a verified shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Mason v. Rhodes, No. 5:19-cv-03997-NC. The complaint alleges that certain of our former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties, have been unjustly enriched and violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, in connection with our IPO and our 2018 proxy statement. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, declaratory relief, other equitable relief and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On August 21, 2019, the District Court granted the parties\u2019 joint stipulation to stay the Mason action during the pendency of the Federal Actions. On December 15, 2020, the District Court granted the parties\u2019 further stipulation to stay the Mason action during the pendency of the Federal Action, and the case remains stayed.\nWhile we believe these claims to be without merit, we cannot assure you that additional claims alleging the same or similar facts will not be filed. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. For additional details of the legal proceedings currently affecting the Company, please see Note 9 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the production of our systems and only have contracts with certain suppliers for the components used in our systems. The failure of these third parties to perform could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our systems in a timely and cost effective manner.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers in Karmiel, Israel, Mazet, France, Weston, Florida and San Jose, California for the manufacture of the majority of our systems. Other than with respect to the ARTAS\u00ae iX System and diode stacks for certain of our devices, the majority of the components used in our systems are available off the shelf and we do not rely on any single supplier, and as a result we do not have any long-term supply agreements for these components. Our reliance on third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers involves a number of risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers or suppliers may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our systems or cause delays in shipments of our systems;\n\u2022\nwe or our contract manufacturers or suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, we or our contract manufactures may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u2022\nwe or our contract manufacturers and suppliers may be subject to price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components;\n\u2022\nwe or our contract manufacturers and suppliers may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of our systems;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in delivery by our contract manufacturers and suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for systems that our contract manufacturers and suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour suppliers or those of our contract manufacturers may wish to discontinue supplying components or services to us for risk management reasons;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our system and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the necessary components become unavailable; and\n\u2022\nour contract manufacturers and suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill its orders and meet our requirements.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they could significantly increase our costs and effect our ability to meet demand for our systems. If we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our systems in a timely manner, our ability to generate revenue would be impaired, market acceptance of our systems and our reputation could be adversely affected, and customers may instead purchase or use our competitors\u2019 products. In addition, we could be forced to secure new or alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers. Securing a replacement contract manufacturer or supplier could be difficult. The introduction of new or alternative manufacturers or suppliers also may require design changes to our medical device products that are subject to the FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals, or a new or revised CE Certificate of Conformity. We may also be required to assess the new manufacturer\u2019s compliance with all applicable regulations and guidelines, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our systems in a timely manner. As a result, we could incur increased production costs, experience delays in deliveries of our systems, suffer damage to our reputation, and experience an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe rely on a single third-party manufacturer for the manufacturing of the reusable procedure kits, disposable procedure kits and spare procedures kits used with the ARTAS\u00ae System and the ARTAS\u00ae iX System.\nNPI produces reusable procedure kits, disposable procedure kits and spare kits used with the ARTAS\u00ae System and ARTAS\u00ae iX System. If the operations of NPI are interrupted or if it is unable or unwilling to meet our delivery requirements due to capacity limitations or other constraints, we may be limited in our ability to fulfill new customer kit orders required for use with the existing ARTAS\u00ae System and ARTAS\u00ae iX System. Any change to another contract manufacturer would likely entail significant delay, require us to devote substantial time and resources, and could involve a period in which our products could not be produced in a timely or consistently high-quality manner, any of which could harm our reputation and results of operations.\nWe have a manufacturing agreement for consumables with NPI for the supply of consumable products, including reusable procedure kits, disposable procedure kits and spare procedure kits used with the ARTAS\u00ae System and ARTAS\u00ae iX System, pursuant to which we make purchases on a purchase order basis. The agreement is effective for an initial term of two years and will continue to automatically renew for additional twelve-month periods, subject to either party\u2019s right to terminate the agreement upon 180 days advance notice during the initial term if our quarterly forecasted demand falls below 75% of our historical forecasted demand for the same period in the previous year or upon 120 days\u2019 advance notice after the initial term.\nIn addition, our reliance on NPI involves a number of other risks, including, among other things, that:\n\u2022\nour various procedure kits may not be manufactured in accordance with agreed upon specifications or in compliance with regulatory requirements, or its manufacturing facilities may not be able to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, which could negatively affect the safety or efficacy of our procedure kits, cause delays in shipments of our procedure kits, or require us to recall procedure kits previously delivered to customers or subject us to enforcement actions by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to respond in a timely manner to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, we may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to price fluctuations when a supply contract is renegotiated or if our existing contract is not renewed;\n\u2022\nNPI may wish to discontinue manufacturing and supplying products to us for risk management reasons; and\n\u2022\nNPI may encounter financial or other hardships unrelated to our demand for products, which could inhibit its ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nIf any of these risks materialize, it could significantly increase our costs, our ability to generate net sales would be impaired, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected, and customers may instead purchase or use our competitors\u2019 products, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturing of our various procedure kits, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements, which could further impede our ability to manufacture the procedure kits in a timely manner. Transitioning to a new supplier could be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery. The occurrence of these events could harm our ability to meet the demand for our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure alternative equipment and materials and utilize such equipment and materials without experiencing interruptions in our workflow. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring or revalidating the equipment and components we require for the ARTAS\u00ae System and ARTAS\u00ae iX System, including the related consumables, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nPursuant to the Order of the Health Officer of the County of Santa Clara directing all individuals to shelter-in-place, which was issued on March 16, 2020, in response to impact of COVID-19 pandemic (as updated, the \u201cOrder\u201d), we were unable to access our facility in San Jose or NPI\u2019s facility until June 1, 2020. As a result, we were unable to manufacture sufficient ARTAS\u00ae procedure kits during this period and were limited to shipping procedure kits from existing inventory. While we currently have access to our San Jose facility and NPI\u2019s facility has re-opened and we are able to manufacture ARTAS\u00ae procedure kits, we cannot predict whether these facilities will be closed again by the Order of the Health Officer of the County of Santa Clara, or California State public health orders in response to the future COVID-19 developments in the County or State.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our next generation ARTAS\u00ae System, called the ARTAS\u00ae iX System in high-quality commercial quantities successfully and consistently to meet demand, our penetration of the hair restoration market will be limited, and our reputation could be harmed.\nTo manufacture our ARTAS\u00ae iX System in the quantities that we believe will be required to meet anticipated market demand, we will need to develop and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity, which will involve significant challenges. Historically, we have not manufactured any of our other ARTAS\u00ae System products in-house or without the contract manufacturer involvement. We have been manufacturing the ARTAS\u00ae iX System without a third-party contract manufacturer\u2019s involvement for over 18 months. The continuous development of commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities will require us (or our contract manufacturer for ARTAS\u00ae iX System, if we decide to utilize one on a long-term basis) to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain the technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. We also may become subject to additional, onerous regulatory requirements from the U.S. regulatory agencies as well as foreign regulatory agencies. Neither we nor a third-party manufacturer, if one is utilized, may successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing processes in a timely manner, or at all.\nIf we or a contract manufacturer, if one is utilized, are unable to produce the ARTAS\u00ae iX System in sufficient quantities to meet anticipated customer demand, our revenue, business, financial prospects, and reputation would be harmed. The limited experience we have, or a third-party manufacturer may have, if one is utilized, in producing the ARTAS\u00ae iX System may also result in quality issues, and possibly result in product recalls. Manufacturing delays related to quality control could harm our reputation and decrease our revenue. Any recall could be expensive and generate negative publicity, which could impair our ability to market the ARTAS\u00ae iX System and procedures and further affect our results of operations.\nBoth our manufacturing of certain of our systems and NPI\u2019s manufacturing of the ARTAS\u00ae procedure kits are dependent upon third-party suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers, for the majority of our components, subassemblies and materials, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nWe and NPI, as the case may be, rely on several sole source suppliers, including Kuka Robotics, Inc., FLIR Integrated Imaging Solutions Inc. and 3D-CAM International Corporation, for certain components of the ARTAS\u00ae iX System, reusable procedure kits, disposable procedure kits and spare procedure kits. We also rely on other suppliers for some of the components used to manufacture our other devices. These suppliers may be unwilling or unable to supply components of these systems to us or NPI reliably and at the levels we anticipate or require meeting demand for our products. For us to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide products and components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. An interruption in our commercial operations could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these components, and if we cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute. We source a number of components used in the manufacture of our systems from China; the potential re-emergence of the coronavirus could make access to our existing supply chain difficult or impossible and could materially impact our business, and any disruption in the chain of supply may result in manufacturing delays and inventory shortages. If we are required to transition to new third-party suppliers for certain components of our systems or our ARTAS\u00ae procedure kits, we believe that there are only a few such suppliers that can supply the necessary components. A supply interruption, price fluctuation or an increase in demand beyond our current suppliers\u2019 capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture our systems and NPI\u2019s ability to manufacture our ARTAS\u00ae procedure kits until new sources of supply are identified and qualified. In addition, the use of components or materials furnished by these alternative suppliers could require us to alter our operations.\nOur reliance on these suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ninterruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ndelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues, or a supplier\u2019s variation in a component;\n\u2022\na lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner, or to obtain adequate supply on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost associated with locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers, and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u2022\ndelay in delivery due to our suppliers prioritizing other customer orders over ours;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation caused by defective components produced by our suppliers;\n\u2022\nincreased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement based upon defects in components produced by our suppliers; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers.\nWhere practicable, we are seeking, or intending to seek, second-source manufacturers for certain of our components. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in establishing second-source manufacturers or that the second-source manufacturers will be able to satisfy commercial demand for our systems.\nIf any of these risks materialize, costs could significantly increase and our ability to meet demand for our products could be impacted. If we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our systems in a timely manner, our ability to generate revenue from these systems would be impaired.\nWe forecast sales to determine requirements for components and materials used in our systems and if our forecasts are incorrect, we may experience delays in shipments or increased inventory costs.\nWe keep limited materials, components and finished products on hand. To manage our operations, with third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, we forecast anticipated system orders and material requirements to predict our inventory needs and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Several components of our systems require significant order lead time. As our business continues to expand and if our needs for components and materials increases beyond our estimates, our manufacturers and suppliers may be unable to meet our demand. In addition, if we underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay, or prevent delivery of our systems. In contrast, if we overestimate our requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase use of our working capital. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial condition and the level of satisfaction our customers have with our business.\nAlthough we actively train our customers on the use of our systems and post-treatment care, misuse by the operator of our systems may result in adverse results and may subject us to liability or otherwise harm our reputation and our business.\nWe and our independent distributors market and sell our systems to physicians and other customers. In the United States and certain international markets, subject to local regulations, physician customers can generally allow nurse practitioners, technicians and other non-physicians to perform aesthetic procedures using our systems under their direct supervision. Although we and our distributors provide training on the use of our systems as well as the proper post-treatment care, we do not supervise the procedures performed with our systems, nor can we be certain that physicians are directly supervising procedures according to our recommendations. The potential misuse of our systems or failing to adhere to operating guidelines can cause skin damage and underlying tissue damage, which could harm the reputation of our systems and expose us to costly product liability litigation. In addition, patients may not comply with post-treatment guidelines, which could also lead to adverse results and subject us to claims by patients.\nProduct liability suits could be brought against us for defective design, labeling, material, workmanship, or software or misuse of our systems, and could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages, an increase in our insurance rates and substantial harm to our reputation.\nIf our systems are defectively designed, manufactured, or labeled, contain defective components or software, or are misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients. For example, if a patient is injured or suffers unanticipated adverse events after undergoing a procedure using one of our systems, or if system operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to product liability claims. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our systems, or any future systems or services;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to customers, patients or clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize future products.\nWe currently have product liability insurance, but any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nThird parties may attempt to reverse engineer or produce counterfeit versions of our systems which may negatively affect our reputation, or harm patients and subject us to product liability claims.\nThird parties have sought in the past, and in the future may seek, to reverse engineer or develop counterfeit products that are substantially similar or compatible with our systems and available to practitioners at lower prices than our own. Practitioners may be able to make unauthorized use of our systems\u2019 technology. In addition, if copies of products that have been reverse engineered or counterfeit products are used with or in place of our own, we could be subject to product liability claims resulting from the use of damaged or defective goods and suffer damage to our reputation.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability.\nIn the ordinary course of our business and to the extent necessary, we rely on software to control the ongoing use of our systems, collect, and aggregate diagnostic data, and collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, and certain personally identifiable information of customers, distributors, consultants and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. We have established physical, electronic, and policy measures to secure our systems in an attempt to prevent a system breach and the theft of data we collect, and we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring in our effort to provide security for our information technology systems and the digital information we collect, process, transmit and store. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems and related infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors, and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, may be vulnerable to attacks by computer viruses, malware, hackers, or breaches due to malfeasance, employee or contractor error, telecommunication or electrical failures, terrorism or other created or natural disasters. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media, or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable. We could also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe clinical trial process required to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes and could result in delays in new product introductions.\nIn order to obtain 510(k) clearance for certain of our systems, we were required to conduct clinical trials, and we expect to conduct clinical trials in support of marketing authorization for future products and product enhancements. Conducting clinical trials is a complex and expensive process, can take many years, and outcomes are inherently uncertain. We may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results, and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Any of our products may malfunction or may produce undesirable adverse effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials. We, the FDA, or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time to avoid exposing trial participants to unacceptable health risks.\nSuccessful results of pre-clinical studies are not necessarily indicative of future clinical trial results, and predecessor clinical trial results may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to prove safety or efficacy, and may require us to pursue additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could further delay the clearance or approval of our products. The data we collect from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the FDA clearance or approval, and if we are unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our future products in our clinical trials, we will be unable to obtain regulatory clearance or approval to market our products.\nIn addition, we may estimate and publicly announce the anticipated timing of the accomplishment of various clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which are often referred to as milestones. These milestones could include the obtainment of the right to affix the CE Mark in the European Union; the submission to the FDA of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application to commence a pivotal clinical trial for a new product; the enrollment of patients in clinical trials; the release of data from clinical trials; and other clinical and regulatory events. The actual timing of these milestones could vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will meet our projected milestones and if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients in a timely manner or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a number of reasons, including delays or failures related to:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of a product for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committees\u2019 approval to conduct a clinical trial at each prospective site;\n\u2022\nrecruiting and enrolling patients and maintaining their participation in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nhaving clinical sites observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\naddressing any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial;\n\u2022\naddressing any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nadding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites.\nPatient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient follow-up depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, patient compliance, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new treatments that may be cleared or approved for the indications we are investigating. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and efficacy of a product, or they may be persuaded to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of a competitor\u2019s product. In addition, patients participating in our clinical trials may drop out before completion of the trial or suffer adverse medical events unrelated to our products. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may delay commencement or completion of the clinical trial, cause an increase in the costs of the clinical trial and delays, or result in the failure of the clinical trial.\nWe could also encounter delays if the FDA concluded that our financial relationships with our principal investigators resulted in a perceived or actual conflict of interest that may have affected the interpretation of a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site or the utility of the clinical trial itself. Principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation and/or stock options in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation to or ownership interest by the clinical investigator carrying out the study result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of our marketing application by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing any of our products in development.\nFurthermore, clinical trials may also be delayed because of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022\ninability of a clinical investigator or clinical trial site to continue to participate in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate a benefit from using the product; and\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nAdditionally, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our products may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from these products will be delayed or not realized at all. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of a clinical trial may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of the subject product.\nWe have increased the size of our company significantly over a short period, and difficulties managing our continued growth could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have increased our head count from a few employees in 2009 to 384 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. Our ability to manage our operations and growth requires the continued improvement of our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively or if we are unable to attract, incentivize and integrate additional highly qualified personnel, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe depend on skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business effectively. If we are unable to recruit, hire, and retain these employees, our ability to manage and expand our business will be hampered, which could negatively affect our future revenue and profitability.\nWe are highly dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, sales and marketing, product development and other personnel. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent enhancement of the execution of our business and the development of future products and services. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team, these agreements do not provide for a fixed term of service.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in the medical device field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by the industry. Our ability to retain skilled employees and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. We will face significant challenges and risks in hiring, training, managing, and retaining sales and marketing, product development, financial reporting, and regulatory compliance employees, many of whom may be geographically dispersed. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. The failure to attract and retain personnel, particularly sales and marketing and product development personnel, could materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the past and if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of the Company.\nPrior to the Merger, Venus Concept Ltd. was a private company. The Merger, as more fully described under Note 1 \u201cNature of Operations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Venus Concept Ltd. as the acquiring company for accounting purposes, and the Company as the legal acquirer. As a result, upon consummation of the Merger, the historical financial statements of Venus Concept Ltd. became the historical financial statements of the combined organization. As a private company, Venus Concept Ltd. has not historically prepared public company level financial statements. In connection with our preparation and the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and for the years then ended, we identified a material weakness related to lack of centralized procedures or a technology solution that would ensure appropriate lessor accounting processes and enable the accurate and timely preparation of financial statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have reviewed the key business processes related to collection and evaluation of information relevant to the Company\u2019s subscription contracts for all of its subsidiaries. We also developed a streamlined, centralized process where all subscription contracts are reviewed consistently in order to identify any collection risks and ensured that the allowance for doubtful accounts for such contracts as of December 31, 2020 was accurate and complete. These measures enabled the accurate and timely preparation of consolidated financial statements. As a result, we concluded that the material weakness associated with lessor accounting process was fully remediated as of December 31, 2020.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls and continuing to update and maintain internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to implement new processes and modify our existing processes and take significant time to complete. If we fail to enhance our internal control over financial reporting to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately, which could increase operating costs and harm our business, including investors\u2019 perception of our business.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend on may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nSome of our facilities are located in San Jose, California, which in the past has experienced both severe earthquakes and floods. We do not carry earthquake or flood insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of these facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our manufacturing resource planning for the ARTAS\u00ae System and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult for us to achieve our growth strategy for our hair restoration business. The disaster recovery and business continuity plan we have in place are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses because of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake or flood insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain, retain and enforce adequate intellectual property rights covering our products and any future products we develop, others may be able to make, use, or sell products that are substantially the same as ours, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur commercial success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining, retaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including our patents and the patents we exclusively license. If we are unable to obtain, maintain, retain and enforce sufficiently broad intellectual property protection covering our products and any other products we develop, others may be able to make, use, or sell products that are substantially the same as our products without incurring the sizeable development and licensing costs that we have incurred, which would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in the market.\nWe have obtained and maintained our existing patents, seek to diligently prosecute our existing patent applications, and seek to file patent applications and obtain additional patents and other intellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products that compete with our current and future products. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s patent portfolio was comprised of 107 issued U.S. patents, 11 pending U.S. patent applications, 111 issued foreign counterpart patents, and 27 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. However, patents may not be issued on any pending or future patent applications we file, the claims that issue may provide limited or no coverage of its products and technologies, and, moreover, issued patents owned or licensed to us now or in the future may be found by a court to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable at any time. We may choose to not apply for patent protection or may fail to apply for patent protection on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion. In addition, we may be unable to obtain patents necessary to protect our technology or products due to prior uses of or claims to similar processes or systems by third parties, or to blocking intellectual property owned by third parties. Even though we have issued patents, and even if additional patents are issued to us in the future, they may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from using similar technology or marketing similar products, or limit the length of time our technologies and products have patent protection. Also, even if our existing and future patents are determined to be valid and enforceable, they may not be drafted or interpreted broadly enough to prevent others from marketing products and services similar to ours, by easily designing products around our patents or otherwise developing competing products or technologies. In addition, the ownership or inventorship of one or more of our patents and patent applications may be challenged by one or more parties in one or more jurisdictions, including in a patent interference or a derivation proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), or a similar foreign governmental agency or during the course of a litigation. If a competitor were able to successfully design around our patents, we may not be able to block such competition, and furthermore the competitor\u2019s products may be more effective or commercially successful than its products. In addition, our current patents will eventually expire, or they may otherwise cease to provide meaningful competitive advantage, and we may be unable to adequately develop new technologies and obtain future patent protection to preserve our competitive advantage or avoid other adverse effects on our business.\nWe have a number of foreign patent applications, and while we generally try to pursue patent protection in the jurisdictions in which we do or intend to do significant business, the filing, prosecuting, maintaining and defending patents relating to our current or future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining, protecting, and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to its products in various jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and we may be unable to prevent such competitors from importing those infringing products into territories where we do not have patent protection or into territories where we do have patent protection but there is no prohibition against such importation, or even if such prohibitions exist, the law or related enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our systems and our patents and our other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent competitors from competing in those jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nThird-party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the scope of protection of patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain a meaningful scope of patent protection or market and sell our products or develop, market, and sell future products. In the United States, other parties may attack the validity of our patents after they issue, in a court proceeding, or in an ex-parte reexamination proceeding or one or more post-grant procedures that were authorized under the America Invents Act of 2011, that were available commencing on March 16, 2013 such as post-grant review, covered business method review or inter partes review, in front of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial.\nAt any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved, and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks related to any patent litigation. Any potential intellectual property litigation may (i) force us to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, (ii) cause us to incur substantial costs, and (iii) could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Finally, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers, suppliers and international distributors against claims relating to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties relating to our products, methods, and/or manufacturing processes. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers, suppliers, or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, suppliers, or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers, or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products, or our suppliers may be forced to stop providing us with products.\nThe legal determinations relating to patent rights afforded to companies in the medical technology and aesthetic product fields can be uncertain and involve complex legal, factual, and scientific questions, sometimes involving important legal principles which remain uncertain or unresolved, and such uncertainty could affect the outcome or intellectual property related legal determinations in which we are involved.\nBoth the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. In addition, the U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation that would change certain provisions of U.S. federal patent law. We cannot predict future changes which U.S. and foreign courts may make in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws which might be enacted into law by U.S. and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patent rights, and our ability to obtain patents in the future.\nProsecution of patent applications, post-grant opposition proceedings, and litigation to establish the validity, enforceability, and scope of patents, assert patent infringement claims against others or defend against patent infringement claims by others are expensive and time-consuming. There can be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our patents are challenged by one or more third parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation or post grant proceeding could cause us to lose associated patent rights and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims which are allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, furthermore, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities.\nWe do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we do have patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, such proceedings could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property may have occurred or may occur in the future. Any reverse engineered or counterfeit products that purport to be our systems that are currently in the market or that may be introduced in the future may harm our reputation and our sale of products. Moreover, if we commence litigation to stop or prevent any unauthorized use of our technology that occurs from reverse engineering or counterfeiting of our products, or if we have to defend allegations of such unauthorized use of a third party\u2019s technology, such litigation would be time-consuming, force us to incur significant costs and divert our attention and the efforts of its management and other employees.\nWe depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our products.\nOur rights to use the technology we license are subject to compliance with the terms of those licenses. In some cases, we do not control the prosecution, maintenance, or filing of the patents to which we hold licenses, or the enforcement of these patents against third parties. These patents and patent applications are not written by us or our advisors, and we did not have control over the drafting and prosecution. We cannot be certain that drafting and/or prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications by the licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have trademark registrations and applications in the United States and also in certain foreign countries. Actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks might not prevent imitation of our products or services, infringement of our trademark rights by unauthorized parties or other challenges to our ownership or validity of our trademarks. If we are unable to register our trademarks, enforce our trademarks, or bar a third-party from registering or using a trademark, our ability to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and compete effectively in our markets of interest may be adversely affected. In addition, our enforcement against third-party infringers or violators may be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable and may not provide an adequate remedy.\nWe may become subject to claims for remuneration for service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees based in Israel in the course of their employment for Venus Concept Ltd. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967 (the \u201cPatent Law\u201d), inventions conceived by employees during and within the scope of employment with an employer are regarded as \u201cservice inventions,\u201d which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also provides that if there is no agreement between an employer and an employee with respect to the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation for such \u201cservice inventions,\u201d the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her service inventions and the scope and conditions for remuneration. While our employees have generally explicitly waived their right to any additional compensation for their contribution to service invention rights, certain current or former employees may not have signed such waivers, and we may face claims from current or former employees demanding remuneration in consideration for their contribution to service invention rights, which may lead to future litigation, which could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention and we could be required to pay such remuneration.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur devices and our operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business.\nCertain of our systems are regulated as medical devices subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere, including by the FDA and its foreign counterparts. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices:\n\u2022\ndesign, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022\ntesting, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022\nclinical trials;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nmarketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022\npremarket clearance and approval;\n\u2022\nrecord keeping procedures;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nrecalls and field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022\npost-market approval studies; and\n\u2022\nproduct import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a PMA application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. We consider our Venus Glow\u2122 and NeoGraft\u00ae systems exempt from the FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance requirement. We have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA for Venus Concept\u2019s Freeze\u00ae and Venus Freeze Plus\u00ae, Venus Viva\u00ae SR, Venus Legacy\u00ae BX and Legacy CX, Venus Versa\u00ae, Venus Velocity\u2122, Venus Bliss\u2122, Venus Viva\u00ae MD, Venus Epileve\u2122, ARTAS\u00ae and ARTAS\u00ae iX Systems.\nIn the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a legally-marketed \u201cpredicate\u201d device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the United States. market pursuant to a PMA application and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. If a product is not eligible for 510(k) clearance it may require approval of a de novo reclassification petition or a PMA. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months but can take longer. For products subject to PMA, the regulatory process generally takes from one to three years or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA and involves substantially greater risks and commitment of resources than either the 510(k) clearance or de novo processes. We may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our products under development, and delays in receipt of, or failure to receive such approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our products. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may fail to obtain any marketing clearances or approvals, lose any marketing clearance or approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, we have ongoing responsibilities under the FDA regulations. The failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our systems and result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties;\n\u2022\ndebarment;\n\u2022\ntermination of distribution;\n\u2022\nrecalls or seizures of products;\n\u2022\ndelays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant future clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nwithdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our product or products; and\n\u2022\nin the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nWe must maintain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to market and sell our systems. In the EEA, manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex II to the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. With respect to active implantable medical devices or Class III devices, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless reliance on existing clinical data from equivalent devices can be justified. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, which are complex and rapidly changing. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, both in the United States and internationally. New global privacy rules are being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened. Complying with these numerous, complex and often changing regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information, whether by us, one of our business associates or another third-party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; damages; litigation; consent orders; and injunctive relief.\nThe regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of personal information, is increasing and continues to evolve. For example, the GDPR came into effect in May 2018 reforming the European regime. The GDPR implements more stringent operational requirements than its predecessor legislation. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, provides more robust rights for data subjects, introduces mandatory data breach notification through the EU, imposes additional obligations on us when contracting with service providers and requires us to adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, training and data audit. If we do not comply with our obligations under the GDPR, we could be exposed to fines of up to the higher of 20.0 million Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover in the event of a significant breach. In addition, we may be the subject of litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or expansion of the scope of our CE Certificates of Conformity with our notified body.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals from the FDA or other regulatory authorities or expansion of the scope of our CE Certificates of Conformity with our notified body. Even after achieving the initial market clearance, or approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities or having affixed the CE marked to a product, modifications to our systems during their life cycles may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) clearances, premarket approvals, the conduct of a new conformity assessment with our notified body, or foreign regulatory approvals. Obtaining a new 510(k), other regulatory clearances and approvals, or a revised or new CE Certificate of Conformity can be a time-consuming process, and we may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe are subject to restrictions on the indications for which we are permitted to market our products, and any violation of those restrictions, or marketing of systems for off-label uses, could subject us to enforcement action.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of off-label use in both the United States and in foreign countries. The use of one of our systems for indications other than those cleared by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including, among other things, the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, refusal to issue new 510(k)s or PMAs, withdrawal of existing 510(k)s or PMAs, refusal to grant export approvals, and civil fines or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA regulates the labeling of 510(k)-cleared devices to make sure that the labeling complies with the cleared indications for use and no off-label indication or claim is being promoted by the manufacturer. The FDA also engages in market surveys to identify any devices whose intended uses include unapproved uses of the products. Devices are considered adulterated or misbranded when advertising or labeling creates a new intended use, indications for use or even a new claim.\nWe previously received an inquiry from the FDA regarding apparent off-label or unapproved uses of the Venus Fiore\u00ae on August 1, 2018. Venus Fiore\u00ae is not cleared or approved in the United States or in jurisdictions outside of the United States, other than Israel and certain EMEA jurisdictions. Venus Fiore\u00ae is marketed in Israel and certain EMEA jurisdictions for aesthetic and functional treatment of the vagina, labia and mons pubis. However, we have not marketed or promoted Venus Fiore\u00ae in the United States and explained this to the agency. We added geoblocker functionality to our website, to portray accurately what devices it is marketing in the United States. This matter has been closed by the FDA.\nOur systems may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of our systems may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could act, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, seizure of our products or delay in clearance of future products.\nThe FDA, state regulating agencies at times, and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or if a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur because of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. We cannot assure you that product defects or other errors will not occur in the future. Recalls involving any of our systems could be particularly harmful to our business, financial condition, and results of operations because it is our only product.\nPrior to the Merger, we received a letter from the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (\u201cCDRH\u201d) requesting our assistance to complete an evaluation of a potential post-market safety concern regarding devices used for hair restoration surgery. The letter stated that the potential safety concern is related to adverse events and possible allergic reaction after hair restoration surgery. We cooperated with the FDA in its evaluation. This matter has since been resolved and has been closed by the FDA.\nIf we or our distributors do not obtain and maintain international regulatory registrations or approvals for our systems, our ability to market and sell our systems outside of the United States will be diminished.\nSale of our systems, outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. While the regulations of some countries may not impose barriers to marketing and selling certain of our systems or only require notification, others require that we or our distributors obtain the approval of a specified regulatory body. Complying with foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining registrations or approvals, can be expensive and time-consuming, and we cannot be certain that we or our distributors will receive regulatory approvals in each country in which we plan to market a particular system or that we will be able to do so on a timely basis. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for the FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations, clearances, or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. If we modify our systems, we or our distributors may need to apply for additional regulatory approvals or other authorizations before we are permitted to sell the modified product. In addition, we may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations that we or our distributors have received. If we or our distributors are unable to maintain our authorizations in a particular country, we will no longer be able to sell the applicable product in that country, which could harm our business.\nRegulatory clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and clearance or approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nOur ability to continue manufacturing and supplying our products depends on our continued adherence to ongoing FDA and other foreign regulatory authority manufacturing requirements.\nOur manufacturing processes and facilities are required to comply with the quality management system regulations of its target markets (i.e., the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations, or QSR, ISO 13485:2016, and the MDSAP). Adherence to quality management system regulations and the effectiveness of our quality management control systems are periodically assessed through internal audits and inspections of manufacturing facilities by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with applicable quality management system requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes, including our failure or the failure of our third-party manufacturer to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse quality system inspection, can result in enforcement action, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our manufacturing process and facilities are audited annually for compliance with the last editions of QSR, ISO13485 and MDSAP requirements. The FDA inspected our San Jose facility in January 2020, which audit resulted in two observations. We responded to the FDA in February 2020 and the effectiveness of our actions will be determined during our next inspection. Regulating agencies, including the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities, and our notified body can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations to more severe sanctions such as:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters or warning letters;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\nadministrative or judicially-imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions, fines, consent decrees, or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications for repair, replacement, or refunds;\n\u2022\nrecall, detention, or seizure of products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, or total or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA, a foreign regulatory authority or the notified body to grant pending future clearance or pre-market approval, or to issue CE Certificates of Conformity for our devices;\n\u2022\ndebarment of us or our employees;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances, approvals, and CE Certificates of Conformity;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution of us or our employees.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our system sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in the failure to produce our devices on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nWe may be affected by healthcare policy changes and evolving regulations.\nOur global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Our management must also devote significant time to monitoring developments and changes to ensure our compliance with the various applicable regulations and required approvals. For example, several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation and future changes to applicable United States or foreign tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in laws and policy relating to taxes or trade may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Generally, future changes in applicable United States or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Israel\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations in Israel and therefore our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by political, economic and military conditions in Israel.\nOur research and development facilities and key third-party suppliers are located in northern Israel, and some of our key employees are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business.\nAny hostilities, armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect business conditions and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. In addition, hostilities, armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability involving Israel could have a material adverse effect on our facilities including our corporate administrative office or on the facilities of our local suppliers, in which event all or a portion of our inventory may be damaged and our ability to deliver products to customers could be significantly delayed.\nSeveral countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies whether as a result of hostilities in the region or otherwise. Similarly, Israeli companies are limited in conducting business with entities from several countries. While these restrictions are loosening and countries previously barred from doing business with Israel are eliminating these restrictions, to the extent they still exist, these restrictions may limit our revenues.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East, such as damages to our facilities resulting in disruption of our operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may be affected by negative labor conditions in Israel.\nStrikes and work-stoppages occur relatively frequently in Israel. If Israeli trade unions threaten additional strikes or work-stoppages and such strikes or work-stoppages occur, those may, if prolonged, have a material adverse effect on the Israeli economy and on our business, including our ability to deliver products to our customers and to receive raw materials from our suppliers in a timely manner.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe market price of our common stock following the Merger could be subject to significant fluctuations. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments by competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial and development projections the Company may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits or government investigations, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nif securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the Company\u2019s business, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding our business and stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to hair restoration or other minimally invasive or non-invasive medical aesthetic procedures generally, including with respect to other products in such markets;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations that compete with the products and services of the Company; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for medical device and aesthetic stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies; this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe qualify as, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. We have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on certain executive compensation matters and reduced reporting periods. As a result, stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the securities less attractive as a result of reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from complying with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period. Accordingly, when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, could adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard, unless early adoption is permitted by the standard. We intend to continue to use private company adoption dates for ASC 842, Leases. This may make comparison of us with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nBecause the Merger resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code for Restoration Robotics, Restoration Robotics\u2019 pre-merger net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitation or elimination. The net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of Venus Concept Ltd. and of the combined company may also be subject to limitations as a result of ownership changes.\nRestoration Robotics incurred substantial losses during its history and carried forward significant net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201ds) to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. If a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds 50 percentage points by value over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under applicable state income tax laws. The Merger resulted in an ownership change for Restoration Robotics and, accordingly, Restoration Robotics\u2019 net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitation and possibly elimination after the Merger. The Merger may limit our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes. Consequently, even if the combined company achieves profitability, it may not be able to utilize a material portion of the predecessor companies\u2019 or the combined company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors, subject to applicable law and will depend on various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. Therefore, our stockholders are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive a return on their investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased it. The terms of our credit facilities limit our ability to pay dividends.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition more difficult and may discourage any takeover attempts our stockholders may consider favorable, and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in management without the consent of the board of directors. These provisions will include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to alter its bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 662\u20443% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal its bylaws or repeal the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of the stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to act, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions would apply even we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cSection 203\u201d). Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nOur executive officers, directors and certain of our shareholders who are affiliated with our directors will have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors and certain of our shareholders who are affiliated with our directors, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 36.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, if they choose to act together, these persons would control or significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe incur significant costs because of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and the rules of the SEC, require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, filing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costlier. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including consultants, manufacturers, distributors, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including consultants, manufacturers, distributors, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse, data privacy laws and other similar non-U.S. laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our nonclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or technologies, which could disrupt our ongoing business, divert the attention of our management and employees and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may, from time to time, evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of other complementary businesses, products or technologies, as well as consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or complete otherwise favorable acquisitions because of antitrust or other regulatory concerns. We cannot be certain that the acquisition of the NeoGraft\u00ae business we completed in 2018 or our business combination with Venus Concept Ltd., which closed on November 7, 2019, or any future acquisitions that we may make, will enhance our business or strengthen our competitive position. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the acquired businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. The integration of these businesses may not result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration and these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know-how and processes for which, for example, patents are difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce, or which we believe would be best protected by means that do not result in public disclosure. We may not be able to protect our trade secrets adequately. We have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors and outside scientific advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors. Litigating a claim that a third-party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary technology. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties. However, we may fail to enter into the necessary agreements, and even if entered into, these agreements may be of limited duration or may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. Moreover, others may independently and legitimately develop equivalent trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, if third parties are able to establish that we are using their proprietary information without their permission, we may be required to obtain a license to that information, or if such a license is not available, re-design our products to avoid any such unauthorized use or permanently stop manufacturing and selling the related products.\nWe also rely on physical and electronic security measures to protect our proprietary information, but these security measures may be breached or may not provide adequate protection for our property. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary trade secrets or other proprietary information to our competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized access or use of such information or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nAn active market for our Common Stock may not be maintained.\nOur stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market in July 2017, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market on the Nasdaq Global Market or any other exchange in the future. If an active market for our common stock does not develop or is not maintained, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications, or technologies using our shares as consideration.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about the Company, our business or our market, the Company\u2019s stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event that equity research analysts initiate coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we sell shares of our Common Stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current market price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue Common Stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.", "PERMNO": 16987, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "VERO"}
