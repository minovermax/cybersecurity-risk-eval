{"cik": "1468666", "company": "SecureWorks Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $21.9 million in fiscal 2021, $31.7 million in fiscal 2020 and $39.1 million in fiscal 2019. Any failure to increase our revenue as we grow our business could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability on a consistent basis or at all. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as we implement our growth strategy to maintain and extend our technology leadership, expand and diversify our customer base and attract and retain top talent. Our strategic initiatives may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue to offset these increased operating expenses. Our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons described in this section. If we are unable to meet these risks as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe must continue to enhance our existing solutions and technologies and develop or acquire new solutions and technologies, or we will lose customers and our competitive position will suffer.\nMany of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies, which require them to support a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems and networks. As their technologies grow more complex, we expect these customers to face new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber-attack. To maintain or increase our market share, we must continue to adapt and improve our solutions in response to these changes without compromising the high service levels demanded by our customers. If we fail to predict accurately or react in a timely manner to the changing needs of our customers and emerging technological trends, we will lose customers, which will negatively affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future growth also depends on our ability to scale our Taegis security analytics software platform and our Counter Threat Platform to analyze an ever-increasing number of events. If the number of events grows to a level that our software platforms are unable to process effectively, or if our software platforms fail to automatically handle an increasing percentage of events or are unable to process a sudden, sharp increase in the number of events, we might fail to identify network, application and/or endpoint events as significant threat events, which could harm our customers and negatively affect our business and reputation.\nWe rely on personnel with extensive information security expertise, and the loss of, or our inability to attract and retain, qualified personnel in the highly competitive labor market for such expertise could harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We depend on the continued contributions of Michael R. Cote, our Chief Executive Officer, and our other senior executives, who have extensive information security expertise. The loss of any of these executives could harm our business and distract from the operating responsibilities of other executives engaged to search for their replacements.\nOur Counter Threat Unit and security analyst teams are staffed with experts in information security, software coding, data science and advanced mathematics. We face intense competition in hiring individuals with the requisite expertise, including from companies with greater resources than ours. As a result, we may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals at acceptable compensation levels who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational and managerial requirements. Any failure by us to do so could adversely affect our competitive market position, revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, including from larger companies, and may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nThe market for Taegis SaaS, managed security and other information security services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Increased competition in our market could result in greater pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase, or a loss of, market share.\nMany of our existing and potential competitors, particularly in the large enterprise market, enjoy substantial competitive advantages because of their longer operating histories, greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases, more extensive customer relationships within large commercial enterprises, more mature intellectual property portfolios and greater financial and technical resources. In addition, some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships with one another to offer more comprehensive cybersecurity solutions than each could offer individually. Further, we expect pricing pressures within the information security market to intensify as a result of action by our larger competitors to reduce the prices of their security monitoring, detection and prevention products and security solutions. If we are unable to maintain or improve our competitive position with respect to our current or future competitors, our failure to do so could adversely affect our revenue growth and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, retain existing customers or increase our annual contract values, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo achieve revenue growth, we must expand our customer base, retain existing customers, and increase our annual contract values. In addition to attracting additional large enterprise and small and medium-sized business customers, our strategy is to continue to obtain non-U.S. customers, government entity customers and customers in other industry sectors in which our competitors may have a stronger position. If we fail to attract new customers, our revenue may cease to grow or may decline and our business may suffer.\nSome customers elect not to renew their contracts with us or renew them on less favorable terms, and we may not be able, on a consistent basis, to increase our annual contract values by obtaining advantageous contract renewals. We offer Taegis SaaS and managed security services on a subscription basis under contracts with initial terms that typically range from one to three years and, as of January 29, 2021, averaged two years in duration. Our customers have no obligation to renew their contracts after the expiration of their terms. Our initial contracts with customers may include amounts for hardware, installation and professional services that may not recur. Further, if a customer renews a contract for a term longer than the preceding term, it may pay us greater total fees than it paid under the preceding contract, but still pay lower average annual fees, because we generally offer discounted rates in connection with longer contract terms. In any of these situations, we would need to sell additional solutions to maintain the same level of annual fees from the customer, but may be unable to do so.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers in the financial services industry, and changes within that industry or an unfavorable review by the federal banking regulatory agencies could reduce demand for our solutions.\nWe derived approximately 23.1% of our revenue in fiscal 2021 from financial services institutions and expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the financial services industry. Any of a variety of changes in that industry could adversely affect our revenue, profitability and financial condition. Spending by financial services customers on technology generally has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, based on changes in economic conditions and on other factors, such as decisions by customers to reduce or restructure their technology spending in an attempt to improve profitability. Further, mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce our current and potential customer base, resulting in a smaller market for our solutions.\nSome of our solutions have been deemed to be mission-critical functions of our financial institution customers that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or the FFIEC. We therefore are subject to examination by the member agencies of the FFIEC. A sufficiently unfavorable review of our operations could result in our financial institution customers not being allowed, or not choosing, to continue using our solutions, which could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan and maintain high levels of customer service, and our operations may be disrupted.\nAs our customer base and solutions offerings continue to grow, we will seek to further expand our operations, which could place a strain on our resources and infrastructure and affect our ability to maintain the quality of our solutions, deploy our solutions, support our customers after deployment and foster our customer-focused culture. Our productivity, customer-focused culture and the quality of our solutions may be negatively affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees, particularly our sales and account management personnel, quickly and effectively. In addition, we may need to make substantial investments in additional IT infrastructure to support our growth and will have to maintain or improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures, which will require substantial management effort and additional investments in our operations. If we are unable to manage our growth, expenses or business effectively, our financial condition, results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain high-quality customer service and support functions could adversely affect our reputation and growth prospects.\nOnce our solutions are deployed within our customers\u2019 networks, our customers depend on our technical and other support services to ensure the security of their IT systems. The potential for human error in connection with our customer service and support functions or the internal systems and networks that underpin our ability to provide solutions to our customers, even if promptly discovered and remediated, could disrupt customer operations, cause losses for customers or harm our internal operations, lead to regulatory fines or damage our reputation. In addition, if we do not effectively assist our customers to deploy our solutions, resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional solutions or subscriptions to existing customers could suffer and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. If we fail to meet the requirements of our existing customers, particularly larger enterprises that may require higher levels of support, it may be more difficult to realize our strategy of selling higher-margin or different types of solutions to those customers.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by service level agreements with some of our customers that require us to provide them with credits for service failures or inadequacies.\nWe have agreements with some of our customers in which we have committed to provide them our solutions at specified levels. If we are unable to meet the commitments, we may be obligated to extend service credits to those customers, or could face terminations of the service agreements. Damages for failure to meet the service levels specified in our service level agreements generally are limited to the fees charged over the previous 12 months, but, if challenged, such limits on damages payable by us may not be upheld, and we may be required to pay damages greater than such fees. Repeated or significant service failures or inadequacies could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nBecause we recognize revenue ratably over the terms of our Taegis SaaS applications and managed security services contracts, decreases in sales of these solutions may not immediately be reflected in our results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 76% of our revenue was derived from subscription-based solutions, attributable to Taegis SaaS applications and managed security contracts, while approximately 24% was derived from professional services engagements. Our subscription contracts typically range from one to three years in duration and, as of January 29, 2021, averaged two years in duration. Revenue related to these contracts generally is recognized ratably over the contract term. As a result, we derive most of our quarterly revenue from contracts we entered into during previous fiscal quarters. A decline in new or renewed contracts and any renewals at reduced annual dollar amounts in a particular quarter may not be reflected in any significant manner in our revenue for that quarter, but would negatively affect revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in contracts may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. As of January 29, 2021, we billed approximately 57% of our recurring revenue in advance. We may not be able to adjust our outflows of cash to match any decreases in cash received from prepayments if sales decline. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect reduced revenue, which would have a negative effect on our earnings in future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to increase our revenue rapidly through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable contract term. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations in the current period, making it more difficult for investors to evaluate our financial performance.\nOur sales cycles are long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSales of our information security solutions usually require lengthy sales cycles, which are typically three to nine months, but can exceed 12 months for larger customers. Sales to our customers can be complex and require us to educate our customers about our technical capabilities and the use and benefits of our solutions. Customers typically pursue a significant evaluation and acceptance process, and their subscription decisions frequently are influenced by budgetary constraints, technology evaluations, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will generate long-term contracts. If we do not realize the sales we expect from potential customers, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to expand sales of our information security solutions to customers located outside the United States, our business increasingly will be susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe have limited experience operating in international jurisdictions compared to our experience operating in the United States. We expect to increase our presence internationally through additional relationships with local and regional strategic and distribution partners and potentially through acquisitions of other companies. International revenue, which we define as revenue contracted through non-U.S. entities, contributed approximately 30% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021. Our relative lack of experience in operating our business outside the United States increases the risk that any international expansion efforts will not be successful. In addition, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce the expected levels of revenue or earnings. Conducting international operations subjects us to a variety of risks, including risks described elsewhere in this section. Such risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may adversely impact our operations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.\nEffective on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union in a process commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d in accordance with the Treaty on European Union. Negotiation of some terms of the withdrawal has not yet been completed. Trade, immigration and commercial regulation may be subject to additional modification, and some of our customers may relocate some or all of their operations to jurisdictions outside of the United Kingdom as a result of Brexit. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities and solutions.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As we expand internationally in accordance with our growth strategy, we will enter into more sales contracts denominated in foreign currencies and incur incremental operating expenses outside the United States. Further, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions and subscriptions to our customers outside the United States, which could adversely affect our non-U.S. sales and results of operations. We do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, but, as our international operations grow, we may begin to use foreign exchange forward contracts to partially mitigate the impact of fluctuations in net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. Any such hedges may be ineffective to protect us fully against foreign currency risk.\nGovernmental export or import controls could subject us to liability or limit our ability to compete in foreign markets.\nOur information security solutions and technologies incorporate encryption technology and may be exported outside the United States only if we obtain an export license or qualify for an export license exception. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our solutions and technologies may create delays in the introduction of our solutions and technologies in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from utilizing our solutions and technologies throughout their global systems or prevent the export of our solutions and technologies to some countries altogether. In addition, various countries regulate the import of our appliance-based technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute, and our customers\u2019 ability to implement, our technologies in those countries. Any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions and technologies by existing customers with international operations, loss of sales to potential customers with international operations and decreased revenue. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations, we may be denied export privileges, be subjected to fines or other penalties or fail to obtain entry for our technologies into other countries.\nAn inability to expand our key distribution relationships would constrain the growth of our business.\nWe intend to expand our distribution relationships to increase domestic and international sales. Approximately 12% of our revenue in fiscal 2021 was generated through our channel partners, which include referral agents, regional value-added resellers and trade associations. Our strategy is to increase the percentage of our revenue that we derive from sales through our channel partners. Our inability to maintain or further develop relationships with our current and prospective distribution partners could reduce sales of our solutions and adversely affect our revenue growth and financial condition.\nOur agreements with our partners generally are non-exclusive, and our partners may have more established relationships with one or more of our competitors. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our solutions, if they choose to place greater emphasis on their own products or services or those offered by our competitors or if they fail to meet our customers\u2019 needs, our ability to expand our business and sell our solutions may be adversely affected. Our business also may suffer from the loss of a substantial number of our partners, the failure to recruit additional partners, any reduction or delay in the sales of our solutions by our partners, or conflicts between sales by our partners and our direct sales and marketing activities.\nEven if we do expand relationships with our channel partners, our results will reflect that the gross margins to us from sales by our partners generally are lower than gross margins to us from direct sales. In addition, sales by our partners are more likely than direct sales to involve collectability concerns and may contribute to periodic fluctuations in our results of operations.\nOur technology alliance partnerships expose us to a range of business risks and uncertainties that could prevent us from realizing the benefits we seek from these partnerships.\nWe have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into technology alliance partnerships with third parties to support our future growth plans. Such relationships include technology licensing, joint technology development and integration, research cooperation, co-marketing and sell-through arrangements. We face a number of risks relating to our technology alliance partnerships that could prevent us from realizing the benefits we seek from these partnerships on a timely basis or at all. Technology alliance partnerships can require significant coordination between the partners and a significant commitment of time and resources by their technical staffs. In cases where we wish to integrate a partner\u2019s products or services into our solutions, the integration process may be more difficult than we anticipate, and the risk of integration difficulties, incompatibility and undetected programming errors or defects may be higher than the risks normally associated with the introduction of new products or services. In addition, any particular relationship may not continue for any specific period of time. If we lose a significant technology alliance partner, we could lose the benefit of our investment of time, money and resources in the relationship. Moreover, we could be required to incur significant expenses to develop a new strategic alliance or to formulate and implement an alternative plan to pursue the opportunity that we targeted with the former partner.\nReal or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our solutions or the failure or perceived failure of our solutions to prevent or detect a security breach could harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers and expose us to costly litigation.\nOur solutions are complex and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their adoption by our customers. As a result of such defects, our customers may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and hackers or other threat actors may misappropriate our customers\u2019 data or other assets or otherwise compromise their IT systems. In addition, because the techniques used to access or sabotage IT systems and networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, an advanced attack could emerge that our solutions are unable to detect or prevent. A security breach of proprietary information could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our solutions that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf any of our customers experiences an IT security breach after adopting our solutions, even if our solutions have blocked the theft of any data or provided some form of remediation, the customer could be disappointed with our solutions and could look to our competitors for alternatives to our solutions. In addition, if any enterprise or government entity publicly known to use our solutions is the subject of a publicized cyber-attack, some of our other current customers could seek to replace our solutions with those provided by our competitors. Further, our reputation could be damaged if a cyber-attack were to occur through a customer's security or network devices, applications or endpoints that we are not contractually obligated to monitor, if there is a perception that Secureworks monitors all the affected customer's devices, applications and endpoints.\nAny person that circumvents our security measures could misappropriate the confidential information or other valuable property of our customers or disrupt their operations. Because our solutions provide and monitor information security and may protect valuable information, we could face liability claims or claims for breach of service level agreements. Provisions in our service agreements that limit our exposure to liability claims may not be enforceable in some circumstances or may not protect us fully against such claims and related costs. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures by us and result in interruptions to and delays in the delivery of our solutions, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and damage our business and prospects.\nCyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt our operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary or confidential information about us or our workforce, customers or other third parties could harm our business and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and other liability.\nAs a well-known information security solutions provider, we are a high-profile target and our websites, networks, information systems, solutions and technologies may be selected for sabotage, disruption or misappropriation by cyber-attacks specifically designed to interrupt our business and harm our reputation. Our solutions frequently involve the collection, filtering and logging of our customers\u2019 information, while our enterprise operations involve the collection, processing, storage and disposition of our own human resources, intellectual property and other information. We also rely in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers and other vendors to host, accept, transmit or otherwise process electronic data in connection with our business activities. Criminal or other threat actors may seek to penetrate our network security or the security of our third-party service providers and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our customers or other third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. We may experience breaches or other compromises of our information technology systems. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture that could unexpectedly provide access to a threat actor to our systems and data. The shift to work-from-home arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase our vulnerability, as third-party providers are working remotely and using home networks that may pose a significant risk to network security.\nThe costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant, regardless of whether incidents result from an attack on us directly or on third-party vendors upon which we rely. Cyber-attacks could compromise our internal systems and products and the systems of our customers or third-party service providers, resulting in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service that could disrupt business operations for us and our customers and that could impede our sales. Remediation efforts may not be successful or timely. Breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other third parties could expose us, our customers or other affected third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nIf our solutions do not interoperate with our customers\u2019 IT infrastructure, our solutions may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed.\nOur solutions must effectively interoperate with each customer\u2019s existing or future IT infrastructure, which often has different specifications, utilizes multiple protocol standards, deploys products and services from multiple vendors and contains multiple generations of products and services that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems and avoid disruptions when we provide software updates or patches to defend against particular vulnerabilities. Ineffective interoperation could increase the risk of a successful cyber-attack and violations of our service level agreements, which would require us to provide service credits that would reduce our revenue.\nLoss of our right or ability to use various third-party technologies could result in short-term disruptions to our business.\nWe incorporate some third-party technologies into our solutions and may seek to incorporate additional third-party technologies in the future. Any loss of our right to use third-party or other technologies could result in delays in producing or delivering our solutions until we identify and integrate equivalent technologies. If any of the technologies we license or purchase from others, or functional equivalents of these technologies, are no longer available to us or are no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required either to redesign our solutions and devices to function with technologies available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which could result in increased costs or delays in the delivery of our solutions and in the release of new offerings. We also might have to limit the features available in our current or future solutions. If we fail to maintain or renegotiate some of our technology agreements with third parties, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to license and integrate other technologies with equivalent functions. Any errors or defects in third-party technologies, any inability to utilize third-party technologies as contemplated, or any inability to procure and implement suitable replacement technologies could adversely affect our business and results of operations by impeding delivery of our solutions.\nNew and evolving information security, cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations may result in increased compliance costs, impediments to the development or performance of our offerings, and monetary or other penalties.\nWe are currently subject, and may become further subject, to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the privacy and protection of personal data or other potentially sensitive information. These laws and regulations address a range of issues, including data privacy, cybersecurity and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, retention or transfer of data. The regulatory framework for data privacy and cybersecurity issues worldwide can vary substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the United States, these include laws and regulations promulgated under the authority of state attorneys general. In the United States, state laws also provide for disparate data breach notification regimes that may trigger consumer, customer or regulator notifications, all of which could apply to us in a situation where consumer or employee information is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons in a \u201cdata breach\u201d, depending on the information affected. There also have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that would impose new obligations in the areas of privacy, information security and cybersecurity.\nInternationally, most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. For example, in the European Economic Area, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes stringent operational and governance requirements for companies that collect or process personal data of residents of the European Union and Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance, which can be up to four percent of annual worldwide \u201cturnover\u201d (a measure similar to revenues in the United States). Some countries are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. In addition, under the GDPR and a growing number of other legislative and regulatory requirements globally, jurisdictions are adopting consumer, regulator and customer notification and other requirements in the event of a data breach, with the potential for fines and the possibility of such notifications resulting in penalties for late notice or investigations or litigation relating to the reasonableness of security measures.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these laws and regulations may become substantial and may limit the use and adoption of our offerings, require us to change our business practices, impede the performance and development of our solutions, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance with such laws or regulations, including through individual or class action litigation, or result in reputational harm. We also may be subject to claims of liability or responsibility for the actions of third parties with which we interact or upon which we rely in relation to various services, including, among others, vendors and business partners.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Secureworks brand is critical to our relationships with our existing and potential customers, channel partners and employees and to our revenue growth and profitability. Our brand promotion activities, however, may not be successful. Any successful promotion of our brand will depend on our marketing and public relations efforts, our ability to continue to offer high-quality information security solutions and our ability to successfully differentiate our solutions from the services offered by our competitors.\nWe believe our association with Dell has helped us to build relationships with many of our customers because of Dell\u2019s globally recognized brand and the favorable market perception of the quality of its products. We have entered into a trademark license agreement with Dell Inc. under which Dell Inc. has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to use the trademark \u201cDELL,\u201d solely in the form of \u201cSECUREWORKS-A DELL COMPANY,\u201d in connection with our business and products, services and advertising and marketing materials related to our business. Under the agreement, our use of the Dell trademark in connection with any product, service or otherwise is subject to Dell Inc.\u2019s prior review and written approval, which may be revoked at any time. We must immediately cease use of the licensed trademark generally or in connection with any product, services or materials upon Dell Inc.\u2019s written request. The agreement is terminable at will by either party, and we must cease all use of the Dell trademark upon any such termination. If we discontinue our association with Dell in the future, our ability to attract new customers may suffer.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of other companies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention from our current business and could result in unforeseen operating difficulties, increased costs and dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may make strategic acquisitions of other companies to supplement our internal growth. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition we are able to complete. We could experience unforeseen operating difficulties in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel or operations of acquired companies, especially if the key personnel of any acquired company choose not to work for us. To complete an acquisition, we may be required to use a substantial amount of our cash, sell or use equity securities or incur debt to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants that will limit our capital-raising activities and operating flexibility. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions.\nEarthquakes, fires, power outages, floods, terrorist attacks, public health issues such as COVID-19 and other catastrophic events could disrupt our business and ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire, a flood or a significant power outage, or a widespread public health issue, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although our four security operations centers are designed to be redundant and to offer seamless backup support in an emergency, we rely on two data centers and public cloud providers to sustain our operations. While each of these data centers and public cloud providers are capable of sustaining our operations individually, a simultaneous failure of the centers or public cloud providers could disrupt our ability to serve our customers.\nIn addition, our ability to deliver our solutions as agreed with our customers depends on the ability of our supply chain, manufacturing vendors or logistics providers to deliver products or perform services we have procured from them. If any natural disaster or other catastrophic event, including a pandemic such as COVID-19, impairs the ability of our vendors or service providers to support us on a timely basis, our ability to perform our customer engagements may suffer. Disruptions from COVID-19 or a similar pandemic or public health issue could include, and have included, restrictions on the ability of our employees or the employees of our customers, vendors or suppliers to travel, or closures of our facilities or the facilities of these third parties. Such restrictions or closures could affect our ability to sell our solutions, develop and maintain customer relationships or render services, such as our consulting services, could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or could lead to inadvertent breaches of contract by us or by our customers, vendors or suppliers.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we experienced a limited reduction in customer demand that we believe is attributable to COVID-19 and that we believe may impact our results in future periods. Although we are unable to predict the extent and severity of all future impacts of COVID-19, the pandemic might further curtail customer spending, lead to delayed or deferred purchasing decisions, lengthen sales cycles and result in delays in receiving customer or partner payments. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material negative impact on our business and future financial results.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property rights, and if our patents are ineffective in doing so, third parties may be able to use aspects of our proprietary technology without compensating us.\nAs of January 29, 2021, we owned 47 issued patents and 14 pending patent applications in the United States and three issued patents and three pending patent applications outside the United States. Any failure of our patents and patent strategy to protect our intellectual property rights adequately could harm our competitive position. The legal systems of some countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of other countries may not allow us to protect our inventions with patents to the same extent as U.S. laws. Changes in patent laws, implementing regulations or the interpretation of patent laws may diminish the value of our rights. Our competitors may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our solutions or practicing our own patented technology. If any of our patents is challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties, and if we do not own or have exclusive rights to other enforceable patents protecting our solutions or other technologies, competitors and other third parties could market products or services and use processes that incorporate aspects of our proprietary technology without compensating us, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect, maintain or enforce our non-patented intellectual property rights and proprietary information, our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur business relies in part on non-patented intellectual property rights and proprietary information, such as trade secrets, confidential information and know-how, all of which offer only limited protection to our technology. The legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in the information technology industry are highly uncertain and evolving. Although we regularly enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees, vendors, customers and other third parties, these agreements may be breached or otherwise fail to prevent disclosure of proprietary or confidential information effectively or to provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized disclosure. Our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in other countries. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business and financial condition.\nThird parties could claim that our technologies and the processes underlying our solutions infringe or otherwise violate their proprietary rights. The software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation, including by non-practicing entities, based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, and we expect that such claims may increase as competition in the information security market continues to intensify, as we introduce new solutions (including in geographic areas where we currently do not operate) and as business-model or product or service overlaps between our competitors and us continue to occur. For example, in fiscal 2016, we settled litigation in which a third party alleged that aspects of our business and solutions infringed and induced the infringement of two of its U.S. patents relating to network intrusion and event monitoring technology.\nOur use of open source technology could require us in some circumstances to make available source code of our modifications to that technology, which could include source code of our proprietary technologies, and also may restrict our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nSome of our solutions and technologies incorporate software licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. To the extent that we use open source software, we face risks arising from the scope and requirements of common open source software licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary technology with open source software in a certain manner, we may face claims from time to time from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license.\nOur ability to commercialize solutions or technologies incorporating open source software may be restricted because, among other reasons, open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated or uncertain obligations regarding our solutions, litigation or loss of the right to use this software. Therefore, there is a risk that the terms of these licenses will be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, and we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our solutions, to re-engineer our technology or to discontinue offering our solutions if re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a commercially reasonable manner.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Dell and Dell Technologies\nOur inability to resolve in a manner favorable to us any potential conflicts or disputes that arise between us and Dell or Dell Technologies with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nPotential conflicts or disputes may arise between Dell or Dell Technologies and us in a number of areas relating to our past or ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022intellectual property, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our agreements and relationship with Dell;\n\u2022employee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022business combinations involving us;\n\u2022our ability to engage in activities with certain channel, technology or other marketing partners;\n\u2022sales or dispositions by Dell Technologies of all or any portion of its beneficial ownership interest in us;\n\u2022the nature, quality and pricing of services Dell has agreed to provide us;\n\u2022business opportunities that may be attractive to both Dell and us;\n\u2022Dell\u2019s ability to use and sublicense patents that we have licensed to Dell under a patent license agreement; and\n\u2022product or technology development or marketing activities that may require consent of Dell or Dell Technologies.\nThe resolution of any potential conflicts or disputes between us and Dell or Dell Technologies over these or other matters may be less favorable to us than the resolution we might achieve if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nIf Dell Technologies, Dell or Dell Technologies\u2019 other affiliates or Silver Lake or its affiliates engage in the same type of business we conduct or take advantage of business opportunities that might be attractive to us, our ability to operate successfully and expand our business may be hampered.\nOur certificate of incorporation, or charter, provides that, except as otherwise agreed in writing between us and Dell Technologies, Dell or Dell Technologies\u2019 other affiliates (other than us or our controlled affiliates), referred to as the Dell Technologies Entities, have no duty to refrain from:\n\u2022engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as those in which we are engaged;\n\u2022doing business with any of our customers, customers or vendors; or\n\u2022employing, or otherwise engaging or soliciting for such purpose, any of our officers, directors or employees.\nIn addition, under our charter, Silver Lake and its affiliates, referred to as the Silver Lake Entities, which are significant stockholders in Dell Technologies, have no duty to refrain from any of the foregoing activities except as otherwise agreed in writing between us and a Silver Lake Entity. These and related provisions of our charter could result in the Dell Technologies Entities and the Silver Lake Entities having rights to corporate opportunities in which both we and the Dell Technologies Entities or the Silver Lake Entities have an interest, which might impede our ability to operate successfully and expand our business.\nTo preserve Dell Technologies' ability to conduct a tax-free distribution of the shares of our Class B common stock that it beneficially owns and its ability to consolidate with us for tax purposes, we may be prevented from pursuing opportunities to raise capital, acquire other companies or undertake other transactions, which could hurt our ability to grow.\nTo preserve its ability to effect a future tax-free spin-off of our company, or certain other tax-free transactions involving us, Dell Technologies is required to maintain \u201ccontrol\u201d of us within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is defined as 80% of the total voting power and 80% of each class of nonvoting stock. In addition, to preserve its ability to consolidate with us for tax purposes, Dell Technologies generally is required to maintain 80% of the voting power and 80% of the value of our outstanding stock. We have entered into a tax matters agreement with Dell Technologies that restricts our ability to issue any stock, issue any instrument that is convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into any of our stock or which may be deemed to be equity for tax purposes, or take any other action that would be reasonably expected to cause Dell Technologies to beneficially own stock in us that, on a fully diluted basis, does not constitute \u201ccontrol\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code or to cause a deconsolidation of us for tax purposes with respect to the Dell Technologies consolidated group. We also have agreed to indemnify Dell Technologies for any breach by us of the tax matters agreement. As a result, we may be prevented from raising equity capital or pursuing acquisitions or other growth initiatives that involve issuing equity securities as consideration.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nAs long as Dell Technologies Inc. controls us, the ability of our other stockholders to influence matters requiring stockholder approval will be limited.\nAs of January 29, 2021, Dell Technologies owned, indirectly through Dell Inc. and Dell Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries, all 70,000,000 outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, which represented approximately 84.9% of our total outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 98.3% of the combined voting power of both classes of our outstanding common stock.\nSo long as Dell Technologies controls the majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, our other stockholders will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote in which holders of the Class B common stock are entitled to vote. Dell Technologies is able to control, directly or indirectly and subject to applicable law, significant matters affecting us, including, among others, the election and removal of our directors, and determinations with respect to business combinations, dispositions of assets or other extraordinary corporate transactions. If Dell Technologies does not provide any required affirmative vote on matters requiring stockholder approval allowing us to take particular corporate actions when requested, we will not be able to take such actions, and, as a result, our business and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDell Technologies could have interests that differ from, or conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders, and could cause us to take corporate actions even if the actions are not in the interest of our company or our other stockholders, or are opposed by our other stockholders. For example, Dell Technologies\u2019 voting control could discourage or prevent a change in control of our company even if some of our other stockholders might favor such a transaction.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of our Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nThe dual-class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. The limited ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence matters requiring stockholder approval may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, in 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones changed their eligibility criteria to exclude new companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to certain stock indices. Under the current criteria, our dual-class capital structure makes our Class A common stock ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that track these indices will not invest in our stock. Other major stock indices might adopt similar requirements in the future. It is unclear what effect, if any, exclusion from any indices will have on the valuations of the affected publicly-traded companies. It is possible that such policies could depress the valuations of public companies excluded from such indices compared to those of other companies that do not have multi-class capital structures.\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the marketplace rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, we may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nAs of January 29, 2021, Dell Technologies beneficially owns more than 50% of the combined voting power of both classes of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the marketplace rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, and eligible to rely on exemptions from Nasdaq corporate governance requirements that generally obligate listed companies to maintain a board of directors having a majority of independent directors and compensation and nominating committees composed solely of independent directors. We currently rely on the exemption from the requirement to maintain a board of directors having a majority of independent directors. Although we do not currently rely on the other exemptions from Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance requirements, we may decide to avail ourselves of one or more of these exemptions in the future. During any period in which we do so, investors may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that must comply with all of Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance requirements. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise adversely affect its trading price.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of the Class A common stock.\nAs of January 29, 2021, we have outstanding 12,450,207 shares of our Class A common stock and 70,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock. The shares of Class A common stock are freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, unless these shares are held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or Rule 144. As of January 29, 2021, Dell Technologies owned, indirectly through its subsidiary Dell Inc. and through Dell Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries, no shares of our Class A common stock and all 70,000,000 outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. The shares of our Class A common stock eligible for resale by our affiliates under Rule 144, subject to the volume limitations and other requirements of Rule 144, include the 70,000,000 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the same number of shares of our Class B common stock that are outstanding.\nWe have entered into a registration rights agreement with Dell Marketing L.P. (the record holder of our Class B common stock), Michael S. Dell, the Susan Lieberman Dell Separate Property Trust, MSDC Denali Investors, L.P., MSDC Denali EIV, LLC and the Silver Lake investment funds that own Dell Technologies common stock in which we have granted them and their respective permitted transferees demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by them from time to time. Registration of those shares under the Securities Act would permit the stockholders under the registration rights agreement to sell their shares into the public market.\nOur charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or with our directors, our officers or other employees, or our majority stockholder.\nOur charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers or other employees, or stockholders to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds more favorable for disputes with us or with our directors, our officers or other employees, or our other stockholders, including our majority stockholder, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such other persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur choice of forum provision is intended to apply to the fullest extent permitted by law to the above-specified types of actions and proceedings, including, to the extent permitted by the federal securities laws, to lawsuits asserting both the above-specified claims and claims under the federal securities laws. Application of the choice of forum provision may be limited in some instances by applicable law. Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the choice of forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, subject to a limited exception for certain \u201ccovered class actions.\u201d There is uncertainty, particularly in light of current litigation, as to whether a court would enforce the choice of forum provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act. Our stockholders will not be deemed, by operation of our choice of forum provision, to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and our election to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe have qualified as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, since we completed our initial public offering in April 2016. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and currently intend to rely on the following provisions of the JOBS Act that contain exceptions from disclosure and other requirements that otherwise are applicable to companies that file periodic reports with the SEC. The JOBS Act provisions:\n\u2022provide an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022permit us to include reduced disclosure regarding executive compensation in our SEC filings; and\n\u2022provide an exemption from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements not previously approved.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until: (a) the first to occur of the last day of the fiscal year (1) which follows the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (2) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1 billion or (3) in which the market value of our capital stock held by non-affiliates was $700 million or more as of the last business day of the preceding second fiscal quarter; or (b) if it occurs before any of the foregoing dates, the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nSome investors may find our Class A common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and higher volatility in our stock price.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to furnish a report by our management on, among other matters, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. We are required to disclose significant changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to report accurately our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 16020, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SCWX"}
