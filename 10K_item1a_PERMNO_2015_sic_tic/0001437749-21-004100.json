RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or otherwise, may also impair our business. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Olympic Steel is an essential business and has remained open in all locations, adhering to all health guidelines to operate safely provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and local authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our 2020 results. Beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the end of the second quarter, many of our customers, particularly those associated with the automotive industry, temporarily closed their facilities, reduced hours or staggered production schedules. Since the end of the second quarter of 2020, customers have generally re-opened their facilities or increased production levels. Collectively, these temporary closings, negatively impacted our sales and operating results, especially for the carbon flat products segment during 2020.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our business, financial position or liquidity, such impacts that may be material include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced sales and profit levels, (ii) the slower payment of accounts receivable and potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable, (iii) falling metals prices that could lead to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and the impairment of intangible and long-lived assets, (v) reduced availability and productivity of our employees, (vi) increased operational risks as a result of remote work arrangements, including the potential effects on internal controls, as well as cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to security breaches, information technology disruptions and other similar events, (vii) negative impacts on our liquidity position, (viii) inability to access our traditional financing sources on the same or reasonably similar terms as were available before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ix) increased costs and less ability to access funds under our ABL Credit Facility and the capital markets. To the extent the duration of any of these conditions extends for a longer period of time, the impact will generally be a more severe adverse impact.\nWe cannot predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nVolatile metals prices can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results. Our sales and operating income could decrease if we are unable to pass producer price increases on to our customers or if metals prices decline.\nOur principal raw materials are carbon and stainless steel and aluminum flat-rolled coil, sheet, plate, prime tin mill, pipe and tube that we typically purchase from multiple primary metals producers. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical and, at times, pricing and availability of metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, sales levels, competition, levels of inventory held by other metals service centers, producer lead times, higher raw material costs for the producers of metals, imports, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials to us.\nSimilar to many other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected. Declining metals prices, customer demand for lower prices and our competitors\u2019 responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and potentially inventory lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments as we use existing inventory. Significant or rapid declines in metals prices or reductions in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facility, as well as result in us incurring inventory or asset impairment charges. Changing metals prices therefore could significantly impact our net sales, gross profit, operating income and net income, and could impair or adversely impact the carrying value of any of our assets.\nIncreased metals capacity, supplier consolidation, or an interruption in the sources of our metals supply could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe purchased approximately 56% and 57% of our total metals requirements from our three largest suppliers in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Over the past year, supplier consolidation, decreased mill production due to the COVID-19 pandemic and import tariffs decreased steel availability and increased mill lead times and increased steel prices. Fewer available suppliers increases the risk of supply disruption through both scheduled and unscheduled supplier outages. Conversely, the addition of new mill sources and decreased domestic demand could lead to domestic over capacity, which could lead to a decrease in steel prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have no long-term supply commitments with our metals suppliers. If, in the future, we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of metals on a timely basis, we may not be able to obtain metals from alternate sources at competitive prices. In addition, late deliveries, interruptions or reductions in our supply of metals could make it difficult to satisfy our customers\u2019 just-in-time delivery requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur information technology systems could be negatively affected by cyber security threats.\nIncreased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cyber crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. The risk was further enhanced in 2020 with an increased remote workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, ransom payments, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe service industries that are highly cyclical, and any fluctuation in our customers\u2019 demand could impact our sales, gross profits and profitability.\nWe sell our products in a variety of industries, including capital equipment manufacturers for industrial, agricultural and construction use, the automotive industry, the utilities industry, and manufacturers of fabricated metals products. Numerous factors, such as general economic conditions, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, government stimulus or regulation, availability of adequate credit and financing, consumer confidence, significant business interruptions, labor shortages or work stoppages, energy prices, seasonality, customer inventory levels and other factors beyond our control, may cause significant demand fluctuations from one or more of these industries. Any fluctuation in demand within one or more of these industries may be significant and may last for a lengthy period of time. In periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States, excess customer or service center inventory or a decrease in the prices that we can realize from sales of our products to customers in any of these industries could result in lower sales, gross profits and profitability.\nApproximately 45% and 46% of our 2020 and 2019 consolidated net sales, respectively, were to industrial machinery and equipment manufacturers and their fabricators. Due to the concentration of customers in the industrial machinery and equipment industry, a decline in production levels in that industry could result in lower sales, gross profits and profitability. Approximately 11% of both our 2020 and 2019 consolidated net sales were to automotive manufacturers or manufacturers of automotive components and parts, whom we refer to as automotive customers. Historically, due to the concentration of customers in the automotive industry, our gross profits on these sales have generally been less than our gross profits on sales to customers in other industries.\nOur success is dependent upon our relationships with certain key customers.\nWe have derived and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers. Collectively, our top three customers accounted for approximately 6% and 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Approximately 45% and 46% of our consolidated net sales during 2020 and 2019, respectively, were directly related to industrial machinery and equipment manufacturers and their fabricators. Due to the large concentration of customers in few segments, changes to demand of product by customers in the industrial machinery and equipment manufacturers and their fabricators could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our cash flows. Many of our larger customers commit to purchase on a regular basis at agreed upon prices over periods from three to twelve months. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, the relationship, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated with relatively little advance notice. The loss of any one of our major customers or decrease in demand by those customers or credit constraints placed on them could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our cash flows.\nCapital deployed for acquisitions and capital investments at our existing locations may be unable to achieve expected results, or sustain our growth and events or circumstances that could adversely impact operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have grown through acquisitions and by increasing sales and services to our existing customers, aggressively pursuing new customers and services, building or purchasing new facilities, acquiring and upgrading processing equipment and expanded our product mix in order to expand the range of customer services and products that we offer. We intend to actively pursue our growth strategy in the future.\nFuture expansion or construction projects, could have adverse effects on our results of operations due to the impact of the associated start-up costs and the potential for underutilization in the start-up phase of a facility. We continue to pursue potential acquisition targets; however, we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed. Moreover, in pursuing acquisition opportunities, we may compete for acquisition targets with other companies with similar growth strategies that may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. Competition among potential acquirers could result in increased prices for acquisition targets. As a result, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nThe pursuit of acquisitions and other growth initiatives may divert management\u2019s time and attention away from day-to-day operations. In order to achieve growth through acquisitions, expansion of current facilities, greenfield construction or otherwise, additional funding sources may be needed and we may not be able to obtain the additional capital necessary to pursue our growth strategy on terms that are satisfactory to us, or at all.\nWe continue to invest in processing equipment to support customer demand. Although we have successfully installed new and used processing equipment in the past, we can provide no assurance that future installations will be successful, or achieve expected results. Risks associated with the installations include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\na significant use of management and employee time;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that the performance of the equipment does not meet expectations; and\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that disruptions from the installations may make it difficult for us to maintain relationships with our customers, employees or suppliers.\nDifficulties associated with the installation of new processing equipment could adversely affect our business, our customer service, our results of operations and our cash flows.\nCustomer and third-party credit constraints and credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of our customers may experience difficulty obtaining and/or maintaining credit availability. In particular, certain customers that are highly leveraged represent an increased credit risk. Some customers have reduced their purchases because of these credit constraints. Moreover, our disciplined credit policies have, in some instances, resulted in lost sales. If we have misjudged our credit estimations and they result in future credit losses, lost sales or lost customers, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our allowance for credit losses.\nThe failure of our key computer-based systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUntil our systems implementations are completed, we maintain separate regional legacy computer-based systems in the operation of our business and we depend on these systems to a significant degree, particularly for inventory management. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches and computer viruses. Although we have secure back-up systems off-site, the destruction or failure of any one of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur implementation of information systems could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are in the process of implementing information systems and eliminating our legacy operating systems. The objective is to standardize and streamline business processes and improve support for our service center and fabrication business. Risks associated with the phased implementation include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\na significant deployment of capital and a significant use of management and employee time;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that software and implementation vendors may not be able to support the project as planned;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that the timelines, costs or complexities related to the new system implementation will be greater than expected;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that the software, once fully implemented, does not function as planned;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that benefits from the systems may be less or take longer to realize than expected;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that disruptions from the implementation may make it difficult for us to maintain relationships with our customers, employees or suppliers; and\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the availability and adequacy of proprietary software or consulting, training and project management services, as well as our ability to retain key personnel.\nAlthough we have successfully initiated use of the systems at most of our locations, we can provide no assurance that the rollout to the remaining locations will be successful or will occur as planned and without disruption to operations. Difficulties associated with the design and implementation of new information systems could adversely affect our business, our customer service, our results of operations and our cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on transportation and labor. Increases in the cost or availability of transportation or labor could adversely affect our business and operations, as we may be unable to pass cost increases on to our customers.\nWe ship products throughout the United States via our in-house truck fleet or by third-party trucking firms. Products sold to foreign customers are shipped either directly from metals producers to the customer or to an intermediate processor, and then to the customer by rail, truck or ocean carrier. Our business depends on the daily transportation of a large number of products. We depend to a certain extent on third parties for transportation of our products to customers as well as inbound delivery of our raw materials.\nIf any of these providers were to fail to deliver materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to process and deliver our products in response to customer demand. If any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the availability of drivers and third-party trucks in 2020 and increased the price of transportation services in the United States. Failure of a third-party transportation provider to provide transportation services could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe continued demand for skilled labor resulted in the need to increase pay rates in certain markets. In addition, we have seen a decline in the skilled labor applicant pool since the start of the COVI-19 pandemic. Our operations are dependent on the labor used to operate our equipment and deliver products to our customers. Decreased availability of labor could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe availability of drivers and labor is integral to our operations, and increases in our cost of transportation or labor may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.\nOur success is dependent upon the management and leadership skills of our senior management team. Effective January 1, 2019, Michael Siegal began serving as our Executive Chairman of the Board after serving as our Chief Executive Officer since 1984. Richard T. Marabito began serving as our Chief Executive Officer after serving as our Chief Financial Officer since 2010, and Richard A. Manson began serving as our Chief Financial Officer after serving as our Vice President and Treasurer since 2013. Andrew Greiff began serving as our President and Chief Operating Officer effective January 1, 2020 after serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer since 2016. The loss of any member of our senior management team or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy. We have employment agreements, which include non-competition provisions, with our Chief Executive Officer, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer that expire on January 1, 2024, January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2022, respectively.\nLabor disruptions at any of our facilities or those of major customers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,626 people. Approximately 269 of the hourly plant personnel are represented by nine separate collective bargaining units. Any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, many of our larger customers, including those in the automotive industry, have unionized workforces and some have experienced significant labor disruptions in the past such as work stoppages, slow-downs and strikes. A labor disruption at one or more of our major customers could interrupt production or sales by that customer and cause that customer to halt or limit orders for our products. Any such reduction in the demand for our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nParticipation in multiemployer pension plans carry withdrawal liability risks, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThrough our CTI subsidiary, we contribute to one multiemployer pension plan. The risks of participating in the multiemployer plan are different from a single-employer plan in that 1) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, 2) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and 3) if CTI chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, CTI may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the unfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nIncreases in energy prices would increase our operating costs, and we may be unable to pass all these increases on to our customers in the form of higher prices.\nIf our energy costs increase disproportionately to our revenues, our earnings could be reduced. We use energy to process and transport our products. Our operating costs increase if energy costs, including electricity, diesel fuel and natural gas, rise. During periods of higher energy costs, we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products. In addition, we generally do not hedge our exposure to higher prices via energy futures contracts. Increases in energy and fuel prices will increase our operating costs and may reduce our profitability if we are unable to pass all of the increases on to our customers.\nOur insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or inadequate to cover all of our significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation incidental to our businesses, including claims for damages arising out of use of our products, claims involving employment matters, cyber security claims and commercial disputes.\nWe currently carry insurance from financially solid, highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities. However, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise and any liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disputes with insurance carriers, including over policy terms, reservation of rights, the applicability of coverage (including exclusions), compliance with provisions (including notice) and/or the insolvency of one or more of our insurers may significantly affect the amount or timing of recovery. Although we have been able to obtain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate to cover such liability to date, our insurance premiums may increase in the future as a consequence of conditions in the insurance business generally or our situation in particular. Any such increase could result in lower net income or cause the need to reduce our insurance coverage. In addition, a future claim may be brought against us that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn some circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws, regulations or otherwise. However, these protections are not always available, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred.\nIf insurance coverage, customer indemnifications and/or other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover our risks or losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe net carrying value of intangibles represents non amortizable goodwill and trade names, covenant not to compete and customer relationships, net of accumulated amortization, related to our specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products segments. Indefinitely lived assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as increased competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in discount rates based on changes in the cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the loss of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur business is highly competitive. We compete with metals service centers and, to a certain degree, metals producers and intermediate metals processors, on a regular basis, primarily on quality, price, inventory availability and the ability to meet the delivery schedules and service requirements of our customers. We have different competitors for each of our products and within each region. Certain of these competitors have financial and operating resources in excess of ours. Increased competition could lower our gross profits or reduce our market share and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nAlthough we expect to finance our growth initiatives through borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility, we may have to find additional sources of funding, which could be difficult. Additionally, increased leverage and borrowing rates could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe expect to finance our growth initiatives through borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility, which matures on December 8, 2022. However, our ABL Credit Facility may not be sufficient or available to finance our growth initiatives, and we may have to find additional sources of financing. It may be difficult for us in the future to obtain the necessary funds and liquidity on terms acceptable to us, or at all, to run and expand our business.\nThe borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility are primarily at variable interest rates. If interest rates in the future were to increase 100 basis points (1.0%) from December 31, 2020 rates and, assuming no change in total debt from December 31, 2020 levels, the additional annual interest expense to us would be approximately $0.9 million.\nUncertainty relating to the calculation of London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may adversely affect interest expense related to our outstanding debt, including amounts borrowed under our ABL Credit Facility.\nNational and international regulators and law enforcement agencies have conducted investigations into a number of rates or indices, which are deemed to be \u201creference rates.\u201d Actions by such regulators and law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which certain reference rates are determined, their discontinuance, or the establishment of alternative reference rates. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Such announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. As such, it appears highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, may have on LIBOR or other benchmarks, including LIBOR-based borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our benchmark-based borrowings to be materially different than expected and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance such borrowings or raise future indebtedness on a cost effective basis.\nRegulatory and Environmental Risks\nQuotas and tariffs imposed or removed as a result of government actions can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nGlobal demand and global metals pricing, supply and demand are impacted by quotas and tariffs imposed as a result of government actions. The tariffs initiated by the U.S. government in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (section 232 tariffs) resulted in increased metals prices in the United States during 2018. The subsequent removal and addition of country-specific tariffs has caused uncertainty in the metals marketplace. Any additional future tariffs or quotas imposed on steel and aluminum imports may increase the price of metal, which may impact our sales, gross margin and profitability if we are unable to pass the increased prices onto our customers. The prolonged imposition of tariffs could also lead to additional trade disputes that could impact the global demand for metals and impact on sales, gross margin and profitability. Conversely, the removal of existing tariffs could cause the price of metal to decline, which may impact our sales, gross margin and profitability.\nChanges in laws or regulations, including tax reform legislation, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be affected.\nWe are subject to significant environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nOur businesses are subject to many federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the use, handling, treatment, and disposal of substances and waste used or generated in our manufacturing processes. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions.\nWe may in the future be required to incur costs relating to the investigation or remediation of property, and for addressing environmental conditions. Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Consequently, we cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances, the development of new facts or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former facilities or properties will not require significant expenditures by us.\nWe expect to continue to be subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. It is difficult to predict the future interpretation and development of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or their impact on our future earnings and operations. We anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Any increase in these costs, or unanticipated liabilities arising for example, out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or more aggressive enforcement actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nHistorically, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. Furthermore, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors described herein. Examples include:\n\u25cf\nchanges in commodity prices, especially metals;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments affecting us, our customers or our suppliers;\n\u25cf\npress releases, earnings releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry;\n\u25cf\ninability to meet securities analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by large shareholders;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of shares acquired for short-term investments;\n\u25cf\ngeneral domestic or international economic, market and political conditions;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the legal or regulatory environment affecting our business; and\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions or joint ventures, or other material events impacting the domestic or global metals industry.\nIn the past, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their specific operating performance. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nIn addition, stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. In the past, some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation, regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur quarterly results may be volatile.\nOur operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our operating results may be below the expectations of our investors or stock market analysts as a result of a variety of factors, including the impact of LIFO expense estimates, many of which are outside of our control. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to, the risk factors listed above.\nMany factors could cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly in the future. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful. Investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance. Further, it is our practice not to provide forward-looking sales or earnings guidance and not to endorse any analyst\u2019s sales or earnings estimates. Nonetheless, if our results of operations in any quarter do not meet analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price could materially decrease.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Ohio law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest.\nWe are subject to Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code, which prohibits certain business combinations and transactions between an \u201cissuing public corporation\u201d and an \u201cOhio law interested shareholder\u201d for at least three years after the Ohio law interested shareholder attains 10% ownership, unless the Board of Directors of the issuing public corporation approves the transaction before the Ohio law interest shareholder attains 10% ownership. We are also subject to Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code, which provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed \u201ccontrol share acquisition.\u201d Assuming compliance with the notice and information filings prescribed by the statute, a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if the acquisition is approved by a majority of the voting power of the issuer represented at the meeting and at least a majority of the voting power remaining after excluding the combined voting power of the \u201cinterested shares.\u201d\nCertain provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Code of Regulations and Ohio law could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interest more difficult. For example, these provisions:\n\u25cf\nallow our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u25cf\nprovide for our Board of Directors to be divided into two classes of directors serving staggered terms;\n\u25cf\nlimit who can call a special meeting of shareholders; and\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at shareholder meetings.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nPrincipal shareholders who own a significant numbers of shares of our common stock may have interests that conflict with yours.\nMichael D. Siegal, our Executive Chairman of the Board and one of our largest shareholders, owned approximately 11.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. Mr. Siegal may have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval. In deciding how to vote on such matters, Mr. Siegal may be influenced by interests that conflict with yours.\nGeneral Risks\nClimate change may cause changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events and flooding.\nAn increase in severe weather events and flooding may adversely impact us, our operations, and our ability to procure raw materials and process and transport our products and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs, temporarily impact our production capabilities or cause damage to our facilities. Severe weather may also adversely impact our suppliers and our customers and their ability to deliver and/or purchase and transport our products.", "PERMNO": 80375, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "ZEUS"}
