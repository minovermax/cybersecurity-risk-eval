{"cik": "230557", "company": "SELECTIVE INSURANCE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCertain risk factors can significantly impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings. These risk factors might affect, alter, or change actions we might take executing our long-term capital strategy. Examples include, without limitation, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our existing debt and/or equity securities, or increasing or decreasing stockholders\u2019 dividends. We operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Consequently, we can neither predict such new risk factors nor assess the potential future impact, if any, they might have on our business.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nGovernmental actions to contain or delay the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic since early March 2020 have disrupted ordinary business commerce and impacted financial markets. These governmental actions, for which we cannot predict the extent, duration, and possible alteration based on future COVID-19-related developments, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nThese actions generally have:\n\u2022Negatively impacted the global and United States domestic economies, with some sectors such as travel and leisure, retail, energy, and real estate more significantly affected than others;\n\u2022Increased unemployment;\n\u2022Increased international, federal, state, and local government budget deficits, which has led to adverse rating actions against certain governmental units and increased the general risk of government debt default that could impact the value of related fixed income securities;\n\u2022Induced significant volatility in financial markets;\n\u2022Decreased valuations in markets for equity, fixed income, and alternative investments in certain sectors;\n\u2022Impacted individual income and business revenue, and increased the number of individuals and businesses experiencing financial distress with the potential for insolvency;\n\u2022Decreased premium collections, late payment fees, and reinstatement fees;\n\u2022Generated state and federal legislative or executive branch proposals to (i) require insurance policies to retroactively cover COVID-19-related losses expressly excluded under the terms of some property insurance policies, and (ii) presume that COVID-19 is a work-related illness for certain employees under workers compensation policies;\n\u2022Generated state insurance department bulletins or orders requesting or mandating premium credits and rebates on certain insurance policies that may exceed actual COVID-19-related frequency experience decreases;\n\u2022Disrupted commerce, supply chains, and travel to varying degrees;\n\u2022Increased expense management focus by individuals and all-sized businesses;\n\u2022Increased the demand for and/or limited the availability of certain types of medical resources; and\n\u2022Increased e-commerce, video, phone, and other methods of remote trade and business transaction.\nThe economic impacts of the COVID-19-related governmental actions may impact our revenue, loss and loss expense, liquidity, or regulatory capital and surplus, and operations, particularly as these relate, without limitation, to the following:\nImpact on Our Insurance Operations\n\u2022Because our general liability and workers compensation policies provide for premium audit to assure pricing for actual risk exposure, we must estimate return premium that we may owe policyholders for revenues and payrolls lowered by the extent and duration of the COVID-19-related governmental directives and related economic contraction. Such return premiums could be significant and will impact our underwriting results. Our results include the impact of a $75 million return audit and mid-term endorsement premium accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2020, which reflects our estimate of reduced exposures on the in-force workers compensation and general liability portfolio as of March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had a remaining accrual of $24.8 million.\n\u2022In the second quarter of 2020, we offered a credit equal to 15% of insureds\u2019 premiums for our standard lines commercial automobile and personal automobile lines of insurance for April and May totaling $19.7 million. This two-month premium credit was based on a limited amount of claims reporting data reflecting the impact of the COVID-19-related governmental directives on miles driven, which has reduced claims frequencies. Due to the sudden and dynamic nature of these impacts, we did not rely upon traditional actuarial analysis to support these credits. We will not know the actual impact of the COVID-19-related governmental actions until some point in the future. Should the various governmental directives be extended or reinstated due to increased infection rates, we may give further premium credit to our customers to the extent supported by further analysis. Based on the continued COVID-19-related economic impact, state insurance commissioners may take other regulatory actions requiring additional premium credits in commercial and personal automobile and other lines, and we face the risk that we may be required to return more premium than is warranted by our filed rating plans and actual loss experience.\n\u2022All of our commercial property and businessowners' policies require direct physical loss of or damage to property by a covered cause of loss to trigger a business interruption claim. Whether COVID-19-related contamination, the existence of a pandemic, and/or the resulting government shutdown orders cause physical loss of or damage to property continues to be the subject of much debate and litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of that litigation. Our practice is to include in, or attach to, all standard lines commercial property and businessowners' policies an\nexclusion that states that all loss or property damage caused by or resulting from any virus, bacterium, or other microorganism that induces or is capable of inducing physical distress, illness, or disease is not a covered cause of loss. We offer some limited coverages that could apply in COVID-19-related claims and circumstances, primarily tied to clean-up and food-contamination that are subject to sub-limits. Approximately 95% of our commercial property and businessowners' policies include the very specific and regulatory approved virus exclusion.\n\u2022We purchase a significant amount of reinsurance, including a property catastrophe reinsurance program and property and casualty excess of loss reinsurance treaties. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent increased catastrophic loss activity, the reinsurance industry is seeking to tighten contractual terms and conditions, reduce reinsurance capacity, and increase its pricing for reinsurance protection. Tightened terms and conditions include introducing new coverage exclusions, such as excluding losses related to communicable diseases, particularly for business interruption losses in property treaties and, to a lesser extent, in casualty treaties. To the extent we are exposed to losses on our primary policies from risks, such as communicable disease, these losses will most likely be excluded from coverage under our new reinsurance treaties, and we now face increased underwriting risk. This increased underwriting risk could increase our net loss and loss expenses and increase the volatility in our underwriting results. We experienced risk-adjusted reinsurance price increases at our January 1, 2021 renewals that were at rates higher than we are likely able to generate on the underlying insurance policies we sell.\n\u2022In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there currently are various public policy debates and legislative and regulatory proposals at both the federal and state levels:\n\u25e6Certain states have proposed legislation that would impose liability (including retroactively) for COVID-19-related business interruption losses on policies that do not provide such coverage terms. We cannot predict the outcome of such proposals. We believe that if any of these proposals were enacted, they could impair future commercial activity and would likely be determined unconstitutional after being challenged through litigation. Nonetheless, if such proposals were enacted and upheld as constitutional, they could have a material impact on our profitability, liquidity, and overall financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25e6We are aware of four future pandemic insurance proposals being discussed in Washington, D.C., only one of which has been introduced as proposed legislation. Three of the proposals provide for insurer participation and put insurer capital at risk to various degrees. If any of the proposals involving insurer at risk capital were enacted, it could have a material impact on our profitability, liquidity, and overall financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25e6Certain state insurance departments have indicated that they currently (i) will not approve the filing of rate increases or decreases related - or unrelated - to COVID-19, and (ii) are suspending, limiting, or restricting the approval or attachment of new virus-related exclusions. To the extent any of these regulatory actions do not permit us to modify our rating plans, they could have a material impact on our profitability, liquidity, and overall financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Limited medical resources availability could result in medical inflation and complicate, delay and/or extend medical treatment that could impact exposure on workers compensation, general liability, and personal and commercial automobile claims.\n\u2022Economic inflation could increase our loss and loss expense reserves, particularly associated with our longer tail lines of business.\n\u2022We may have increased workers compensation loss and loss expenses if policyholders' employees in high-risk roles of essential businesses contracted COVID-19 in the workplace. We may experience higher frequency of workers compensation claims, particularly as state legislative or executive order proposals are enacted that create presumptions that the contraction of COVID-19 by an essential business employee who interacted with the public is work-related. We also may see an extension of workers compensation benefits if employees do not have jobs to which they can return.\n\u2022We may experience an increase in liability claims against our policyholders related to business practices as remote-office work-from-home employees return to their pre-COVD-19 office and business locations. This may be exacerbated by an active plaintiffs\u2019 bar seeking to generate COVID-19-related claim activity.\n\u2022Loss frequency and severity could increase related to our auto and property coverages due to, among other things,\ndisruptions in supply chains and changes in business practices and individual behaviors resulting from the shelter-in-place and social distancing measures, such as arson and fraud.\n\u2022Due to the COVID-19-related governmental orders, we may experience delayed reporting of losses, settlement negotiations, and trial of disputed claims that may disrupt our normal claims resolution processes and trends.\n\u2022Service levels could deteriorate if significant numbers of our (i) employees were to be simultaneously infected by COVID-19, whether working remotely or in one of our offices, and/or (ii) remote employees or key business partners are unable to work effectively while sheltering-in-place. Examples of potential work impacts include local internet disruption that prevents access to our virtual private network or similar unavoidable events. Because our employees are working remotely, it also is possible that we will be subject to increased cybersecurity attacks from bad actors.\nImpact on our Investment Operations\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and the related governmental orders may result in further significant equity and debt market volatility that could impact our net investment income due to the following:\n\u25e6Financial market volatility is reflected in our alternative investment portfolio performance;\n\u25e6A change in spreads on fixed income securities may create mark-to-market investment valuation losses and volatility in unrealized capital gains, which will impact GAAP equity;\n\u25e6Losses on securities that we intend to sell may increase, as we give our third-party investment managers flexibility to take advantage of the spread widening in fixed income securities, particularly in asset classes more significantly impacted by COVID-19-related governmental directives and to which the Federal Reserve Board is providing liquidity and structural support;\n\u25e6Economic inflation related to COVID-19 issues could be higher or lower than our expectations and impact our investment returns; and\n\u25e6A potential increase in credit risk associated with municipal bonds for which repayment is supported by dedicated revenue streams that may be impacted by COVID-19.\nImpact on our Capital Position, Liquidity and Financial Leverage\n\u2022Out of an abundance of caution, we significantly increased our short-term debt during the first quarter of 2020 to enhance our liquidity and provide us with additional financial flexibility due to the market volatility and economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. These short-term borrowings totaled $302 million, and we invested the proceeds in high-quality money market funds and fixed income securities. In addition to the $302 million of short-term borrowings, our GAAP equity decreased from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019 to $2.1 billion at March 31, 2020, driven by a reduction in net unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. The combination of the additional borrowings and lower GAAP equity resulted in an increase in our debt to total capitalization ratio from 20.1% at December 31, 2019 to 28.9% at March 31, 2020, above our longer term target of 25%.\n\u2022We subsequently repaid these short-term borrowings by December 31, 2020. The reduction in the short-term borrowings, as well as an increase in our GAAP equity to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, inclusive of our issuance on December 2, 2020, of $200.0 million of 4.60% non-cumulative preferred stock (\"Preferred Stock\"), has decreased our debt to total capitalization ratio to 16.7% at December 31, 2020.\nDespite the improvement in our capital position and a reduction in our debt to total capitalization since the first quarter of 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in future periods, could cause a reduction in our GAAP income or equity, decrease our liquidity, and result in an increase in our debt to total capitalization. This could impact our financial strength ratings and impair our business.\nRisks Related to our Insurance Operations\nWe are subject to losses from catastrophic events.\nLosses from natural and human-made catastrophes including, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, derechos, floods, and fires, some related to climate change - and terrorism, including cyber-attacks, civil unrest, and explosions, can negatively impact our financial results. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. In recent years, the global insurance industry has seen an escalation in the frequency and severity of losses from catastrophes.\nThe United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d) is an international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2018, the IPCC reported in its \"Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C\" that human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.8\u00b0F of global warming above pre-industrial levels and that, if the trend continues at the current rate, it will reach 2.7\u00b0F above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. Climate change models project robust differences in global regional climate characteristics between 1.8\u00b0F and 3.6\u00b0F. These differences, whether attributable to human activities or natural, include increases in (i) mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions, (iii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions. These differences and increases can impact weather patterns and the frequency and severity of catastrophes including hurricanes, severe convective storms, and wildfires. The IPCC's 2019 \"Special Report on Climate Change and Land\" reinforced these findings.\nOur insurance operations primarily write risks in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Southwestern regions of the U.S. Our most significant catastrophe exposures are (i) hurricanes impacting the Eastern U.S., (ii) terrorism events, (iii) severe convective storms, including hailstorms and tornadoes, and (iv) winter storms. Single storms could adversely impact our financial results, but it is also possible that we could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given calendar year. We track our severe weather and catastrophe losses using definitions and information we obtain from ISO\u2019s Property Claim Services unit, an internationally recognized expert on U.S. storm losses.\nCertain factors can impact our estimates of ultimate costs for catastrophes, including:\ni.Inability to access portions of the impacted areas following a catastrophic event;\nii.Scarcity of necessary labor and materials that delay repairs and increase our loss costs;\niii.Regulatory uncertainties, including new or expanded interpretations of coverage;\niv.Residual market assessment-related increases in our catastrophe losses;\nv.Potential fraud and inflated repair costs, partly driven by (a) demand surge post-event, and (b) opportunistic service providers;\nvi.Higher loss adjustment expenses due to shortages of claims adjusters available to appraise damage;\nvii.Late claims reporting;\nviii.Escalation of business interruption costs due to infrastructure disruption; and\nix.Whether the U.S. Secretary of Treasury certifies a terrorist event as an act of terrorism under TRIPRA.\nAn increase in catastrophe losses likely will reduce our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings. The closer a catastrophe occurs to the end of a reporting period, the more likely it is we have limited information to estimate loss and loss expense reserves, adding greater uncertainty to our estimates. More detailed claims information available after the end of a reporting period may result in reserve changes in subsequent periods.\nOur loss and loss expense reserves may not be adequate to cover actual losses and expenses.\nWe maintain reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss expense associated with reported and unreported insurance claims. We base our loss and loss expense reserve estimates on known facts and circumstances, including our expectations of ultimate settlement and claim administration expenses, trends in claims severity and frequency, medical inflation trends, predictions of future events, and other subjective factors relating to our in-force insurance policies. There is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for the settlement of claims.\nReserve estimates may be impacted by a variety of broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends, such as inflation, judicial tort decisions, and various state legislative initiatives. Because we cannot predict the timing and impact of these economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends, and estimating loss and loss expense reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot be sure the reserves we establish are adequate or will be so in the future.\nWe review our reserve position quarterly and adjust the reserve position accordingly. An increase in reserves (i) reduces net income and stockholders\u2019 equity, and (ii) could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt\nratings. As we underwrite new business and renew existing business, we estimate future loss cost trends in pricing our products to generate an adequate risk-adjusted return. If our estimate of future loss cost trends proves to be understated, our pricing of future new and renewal business may be inadequate to meet estimated loss costs trends, understating our future loss and loss expense reserves.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an example of how loss and loss expense reserves might be affected by economic, political, social, or legal developments or trends. Two additional examples are:\n\u2022If economic inflation, including medical inflation, is higher than our assumptions, our loss and loss expense reserves associated with our longer tail lines of business may prove to be insufficient. In particular, our workers compensation line of business is susceptible to this risk, given its extended payment pattern and the current low medical inflationary environment compared to long-term medical inflation rates, which have historically been higher.\n\u2022Several states have expanded or are exploring expanding the statute of limitations for civil actions alleging sexual abuse. By retroactively permitting claims for previously time-barred acts, these \u201creviver\u201d laws may result in insurance claims that could significantly increase loss costs and require re-evaluation of previously-established reserves or the creation of new reserves. Since reviver statutes have been enacted, we have received notices of claims or potential claims for acts alleged to have occurred as far back as the 1950s. Without prior experience, we cannot estimate how many \"reviver\" claims notices we may receive. Most notices we have received are sent on behalf of claimants by attorneys unsure of what insurer or policy (if any) may have covered the alleged assailant or supervising entity and may not implicate insurance policies issued by us or a predecessor. For notices we have determined implicate an insured under a policy issued by us or a predecessor, we (i) have investigated or are investigating facts, (ii) have evaluated policy terms, and (iii) believe we have appropriate coverage defenses and reinsurance protections that have been considered in establishing our reserves. As coverage positions may be challenged through litigation or otherwise, we face litigation risks further discussed below in the Risk Factor entitled, \u201cIncidental to our insurance operations, we are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings that, because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\u201d\nFor further discussion on our loss and loss expense reserves, please see the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d and Note 2. \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to reduce our risk exposure depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance.\nWe transfer a significant portion of our underwriting risk exposure - specifically a portion of our loss and loss expense - to reinsurance companies in exchange for a specified portion of premiums. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms. The availability, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions, including retrocessional reinsurance market capacity. This may fluctuate significantly and not necessarily correlate to the loss experience of our specific book of business. In general, we can consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and rating plans. Any other disproportionate increase in our reinsurance expense that we cannot include in our filed rates and rating plans will reduce our earnings. If we do not obtain expected reinsurance amounts or terms, our reinsurance expenses could increase, we may assume increased risk for individual or aggregate losses, and our ability to write future business could be adversely affected.\nCatastrophes impact many property and casualty insurance lines, but commercial property and homeowners coverages historically have accounted for most of our catastrophe-related claims. To limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance. It is possible that our reinsurance coverage could be inadequate, particularly if:\n\u2022We do not purchase sufficient amounts of reinsurance because of defects or inaccuracies in the various modeling software programs we use to analyze our Insurance Subsidiaries' risk;\n\u2022A major catastrophe loss exceeds the purchased reinsurance limit or is within the limits, but exceeds the financial capacity of one or more of our reinsurers;\n\u2022The frequency of catastrophe losses increases and our Insurance Subsidiaries' insured losses exceed the aggregate limits of the catastrophe reinsurance treaty or our Insurance Subsidiaries experience an aggregation of losses that fall below our per occurrence reinsurance retention; or\n\u2022Our reinsurance counterparties (a) are unable to access their reinsurance markets, or retrocessions, (b) suffer significant financial losses, (c) are sold, (d) cease writing reinsurance business, or (e) are unable or unwilling to satisfy their contractual obligations to us.\nTypically, our reinsurance contracts align with our primary insurance policies. For example, if our primary insurance policies provide coverage for a loss, then our reinsurance contracts typically provide coverage as well (subject to any specific exclusions the reinsurance contracts may contain).\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent increased catastrophic loss activity, the reinsurance industry has sought to tighten contractual terms and conditions, reduce reinsurance capacity, and increase pricing. Tightened terms and conditions include introducing new coverage exclusions, such as excluding losses related to cyber risk and communicable diseases, particularly for business interruption losses in property treaties and, to a lesser extent, in casualty treaties. To the extent we are exposed to losses on our primary policies from risks, such as cyber and communicable disease, that are now principally excluded from coverage under our reinsurance treaties, we face increased underwriting risk. The increased underwriting risk could increase our net loss and loss expenses and increase the volatility in our underwriting results. Decreased reinsurance capacity also would increase our underwriting risk if we cannot fully place our existing reinsurance treaties upon renewal. We experienced risk-adjusted reinsurance price increases at our January 1, 2021 renewals that were at rates higher than we are likely to generate on the underlying insurance policies we sell. This will negatively impact our underwriting profitability in 2021.\nEven with the benefits of reinsurance, our exposure to catastrophe risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe may be subject to potentially significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nWe are required to participate in TRIPRA, which was extended to December 31, 2027, for our Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines business. TRIPRA rescinded all previously-approved coverage exclusions for terrorism and requires private insurers and the U.S. government to share the risk of loss on future acts of terrorism certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Under TRIPRA, each participating insurer is responsible for paying a significant deductible of specified losses before federal assistance is available. Our deductible of $369 million is based on a percentage of our prior year\u2019s applicable Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines premiums. For losses above the deductible in 2021, the federal government will pay 80% of losses, and the insurer retains 20%. Although TRIPRA\u2019s provisions provide some mitigation to our loss exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, our deductible could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. If the U.S. Secretary of Treasury does not certify certain future terrorist events, as happened with the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the 2015 San Bernardino shootings, we could be required to pay terrorism-related covered losses without TRIPRA's risk-sharing benefits. We also could be required to pay terrorism-related losses for customers who declined terrorism coverage.\nUnder TRIPRA, terrorism coverage is mandatory for all primary workers compensation policies. TRIPRA also applies to cyber liability insurance policies reported under a Terrorism Risk Insurance Program-eligible line of insurance. Insureds with non-workers compensation commercial policies have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms. In 2020, 86% of our Standard Commercial Lines non-workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage that included nuclear, biological, chemical, and radioactive (\"NBCR\") events.\nMany states in which we write commercial property insurance mandate that we cover fire following an act of terrorism - regardless of whether the insured opted to purchase terrorism coverage. We also sometimes elect to provide terrorism coverage for lines of business not included in TRIPRA, such as Commercial Automobile. TRIPRA has never covered personal lines of business. Our homeowner policies in Standard Personal Lines exclude nuclear losses, but they do not exclude biological or chemical losses. Our current reinsurance programs generally provide coverage for conventional acts of foreign and domestic terrorism, but afford no coverage for NBCR events.\nWe are exposed to credit risk.\nWe face credit risk in several areas of our insurance operations, including from:\n\u2022Our reinsurers, which are obligated to make payments to us under our reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance credit risk can fluctuate over time, increasing during periods of high industry catastrophe losses. Reinsurers generally manage their large loss exposure through their own reinsurance programs, or retrocessions, about which we do not always have the full details. If our reinsurers have difficulty collecting on their retrocession programs or in reinstating retrocession coverage after a large loss, we may not receive timely or full payment of our reinsurance claims. This means that we have direct and indirect counterparty credit risk to our reinsurers and the reinsurance industry, which is global but relatively small.\n\u2022Certain life insurance companies obligated to our policyholders or claimants under annuities we purchased as part of structured claims settlements, if they fail to fulfill their annuity contract obligations.\n\u2022Some of our independent distribution partners, who collect premiums from our policyholders for us.\n\u2022Some policyholders directly obligated to us for premium and/or deductible payments, the timing of which may be impacted by mandated payment moratoriums.\nOur exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe depend on distribution partners.\nWe market and sell our insurance products through independent, non-employee distribution partners. Insurance law and regulation makes us responsible for the business practices and customer interactions of our distribution partners. Independent distribution partners have, and we expect will continue to have, a significant role in overall insurance industry premium production. While our customers find advantages in using independent distribution partners, our reliance on independent distribution partners presents risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022Competition in our distribution channel, as independent distribution partners have access to products from multiple carriers and markets, and we must market our products and services to our distribution partners before they sell them to our mutual customers.\n\u2022Challenges in developing brand recognition that require us to closely coordinate with our distribution partners, as some customers cannot differentiate their insurance agent from their insurance carrier.\n\u2022Our market share growth is tied to the growth in market share controlled by our distribution partners. Independent retail insurance agencies control 85% of standard commercial lines business and 36% of standard personal lines business in the U.S. Consequently, expansion of our Standard Personal Lines market opportunity could be more limited than our Standard Commercial Lines business. More competitors have focused on lower-cost \"direct-to-the-customer\" distribution models that emphasize digital ease and technological efficiencies to address the discrepancy in agency control of Standard Personal Lines business. Continued advancements in \"direct-to-the-customer\" distribution models may impact the overall market share controlled by our independent distribution partners and make it more difficult for us to grow, or require us to establish relationships with more distribution partners.\n\u2022Aggregation and consolidation of our independent distribution partners and their market share, as some publicly-traded and private equity-backed independent distribution partners have deployed consolidation strategies to acquire other independent distribution partners and increase their market share (\"Aggregators\") over the last decade. If more of our independent distribution partners become Aggregators, or are acquired by Aggregators, Aggregator demands and influence on our business could increase. For example, Aggregators could develop and implement strategies to consolidate their business with fewer insurers and demand higher base and supplemental commissions. Aggregators accounted for approximately 33% of our DPW at December 31, 2020, up from 20% three years ago. Currently, no one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance operations' premium.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by our independent distribution partners' success in marketing and selling our products and services.\nNational and global economic conditions could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth.\nUnfavorable economic developments, such as those that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our earnings if our policyholders need less insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us. An economic downturn also could lead to increased credit and premium receivable risk, failure of reinsurance counterparties and other financial institutions, limitations on our ability to issue new debt, reduced liquidity, and declines in our investments' fair value and financial strength ratings. These potential events and other economic factors could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth. During 2020, 29% of DPW in our Standard Commercial Lines business was based on payroll/sales of our underlying policyholders. An economic downturn in which our policyholders experience declines in revenue or employee count could adversely affect our audit and endorsement premium in our Standard Commercial Lines.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant financial strength rating downgrade, particularly from AM Best, would affect our ability to write new or renewal business. Most policyholders are required by various third-party agreements to use a carrier with a specified minimum AM Best or S&P rating. Downgrades in our credit ratings also could make it more expensive for us to access capital markets. We cannot predict the possible rating actions NRSROs might take that could adversely affect our business or our potential actions in response. Any significant downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. For additional information on our current financial strength and credit ratings, refer to \"Overview\" in Item 1. \"Business.\" of this Form 10-K.\nMarkets for insurance products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe offer our insurance products and services in a highly competitive market characterized by aggressive price competition and downward pressure on gross margins, introduction of new products and services, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product pricing based on performance characteristics, rapid competitor adoption of technological advancements, and consumer and business price sensitivity. Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure timely and consistent introduction of innovative new products and services through digital platforms.\nWe face substantial competition from a wide range of property and casualty insurance companies for customers, distribution partners, and employees. Competitors include public, private, and mutual insurance companies. Many competitors are larger and may have lower operating costs, lower cost of capital, or the ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings. Other competitors, such as mutual or reciprocal companies, are owned by or operated cooperatively for insureds and, unlike us, do not have shareholders who evaluate return on equity performance. Consequently, some competitors may be able to price their products more competitively.\nThe Internet has emerged as a significant competitive marketplace for existing and new competitors. Established insurance competitors, such as The Progressive Corporation, are beginning to explore broader digital offerings on the Internet, while new competitors, such as Lemonade, Root, Metromile, and Next, continue to emerge. Because the Internet makes it easier and less expensive to bundle products and services, it also is possible that companies conducting business on the Internet, in the future, could enter the insurance business or form strategic alliances with insurers. Changes in competitors and competition, particularly on the Internet, could cause changes in the supply or demand for insurance and adversely affect our business.\nThe increasing importance of the Internet, technology, and digital strategy in our industry also highlights our need to attract and retain employees in difficult-to-fill data science, advanced analytics, and IT roles - and the potential negative impact if we fail in so doing.\nWe have less loss experience data than our larger competitors.\nInsurers rely on access to reliable data about their policyholders and loss experience to build complex analytics and predictive models that assess risk profitability, reserve adequacy, adverse claim development potential, recovery opportunities, fraudulent activities, and customer buying habits. Because we use and rely on the aggregated industry loss data assembled by rating bureaus under the anti-trust exemptions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we likely would be at a competitive disadvantage to larger insurers if Congress repealed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\nWe expect the use of data science and analytics to continue to increase and become more complex and accurate, particularly with larger sets of relevant data. Some larger competitors have significantly more data about the performance of their underwritten risks. In comparison, we may not have sufficient volumes of loss experience data to analyze and project our future costs as accurately or granularly. To supplement our data, we use industry loss experience from ISO, AAIS, NCCI, and other publicly available sources. While relevant, industry data may not correlate specifically to the performance of risks we have underwritten and may not be as predictive as data on a larger book of our own business.\nWe are subject to various modeling risks that could have a material adverse impact on our business results.\nWe rely on complex financial and other statistical models, developed internally and by third parties, that predict (i) underwriting results on individual risks and our overall portfolio, (ii) claims fraud and other claims impacts, such as escalation, (iii) impacts from catastrophes, (iv) enterprise risk management capital scenarios, and (v) investment portfolio changes. We rely on these financial and other statistical models to analyze historical loss costs and pricing, trends in claims severity and frequency, the occurrence of catastrophe losses, determining reinsurance attachment and exhaustion points, investment performance, portfolio risk, and our economic capital position. Flaws in these financial and other statistical models, or in the embedded assumptions, could lead to increased losses. We believe that statistical models are extremely valuable in monitoring and controlling risk, but they are not a substitute for senior management's experience or judgment.\nRisks Related to Our Investments Segment\nOur investments are exposed to credit risk, interest rate fluctuation, and changes in value.\nWe depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenue and earnings. Our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, including changes in U.S. Presidential administration, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations, or other factors. Our investment portfolio's value is subject to credit risk from the issuers, and/or guarantors and insurers, of the securities we hold, and other counterparties in certain transactions. Defaults on any of our investments by any issuer, guarantor, insurer, or other counterparty could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains - or result in investment losses. We are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities we own may default on principal and interest payment obligations.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily related to the market price, and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Consequently, the value and liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Future fluctuations in the value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities could result in significant losses and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nSignificant future declines in investment value also could require further losses recorded on securities we intend to sell and credit losses. For more information regarding market interest rate, credit, and equity price risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe have securities tied to LIBOR, which may be eliminated by the end of 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 13% of our fixed income securities portfolio was comprised of floating rate securities tied to the U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), expected to be eliminated by the end of 2021. The global banking industry has used LIBOR as a primary metric to calculate interest rates for numerous types of debt obligations, including personal and commercial loans, interest rate swaps, and other derivative products. In anticipation of LIBOR's elimination, the U.S. Federal Reserve established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") to select a replacement index for U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The ARRC, comprised of a broad group of private-market participants, including banks, asset managers, insurers, and industry regulators, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the recommended benchmark rate to replace LIBOR. SOFR is based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions backed by Treasury securities. The ARRC announced a paced transition plan for this new rate, including specific steps and timelines designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR. We continue to monitor the potential impact, if any, the elimination of LIBOR and the transition to SOFR will have on our floating rate investments' performance.\nWe are subject to the types of risks inherent in investing in private limited partnerships.\nOur other investments include investments in private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies, such as private equity, private credit, and real assets. The primary assets and liabilities underlying the investments in these limited partnerships generally do not have quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets, so their valuation is subject to a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than substantially all of our other investments. Because these limited partnership investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting, any valuation decreases could negatively impact our results of operations. We currently expect to increase our allocation to these investments, which may produce additional variability in our net investment income.\nThe determination of the amount of credit losses taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or our financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of credit losses taken on our investments is based on our periodic evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in credit losses at the time of evaluation. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of credit losses taken as reflected in our Financial Statements. For further information about our evaluation and considerations for determining whether a security has a credit loss, please refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Evolving Laws, Regulation, and Public Policy Debates\nWe are subject to complex and changing laws, regulations, and public policy debates that expose us to regulatory scrutiny, potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business.\nOur operations are subject to complex and changing state and federal laws, regulations, and public policy debates on subjects, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022Pricing and underwriting practices;\n\u2022Claims practices;\n\u2022Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves;\n\u2022Exiting geographic markets and/or canceling or non-renewing policies;\n\u2022Environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") issues, including ESG investment mandates;\n\u2022Assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds, and other mandatory assigned risks and reinsurance;\n\u2022The types, quality, and concentration of investments we make;\n\u2022Minimum capital requirements for the Insurance Subsidiaries;\n\u2022Dividends from our Insurance Subsidiaries to the Parent;\n\u2022Privacy and data security;\n\u2022Tax;\n\u2022Antitrust;\n\u2022Consumer protection;\n\u2022Advertising;\n\u2022Sales;\n\u2022Billing and e-commerce;\n\u2022Intellectual property ownership and infringement;\n\u2022Digital platforms;\n\u2022Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications;\n\u2022Media and digital content;\n\u2022Availability of third-party software applications and services;\n\u2022Labor and employment;\n\u2022Anti-money laundering; and\n\u2022Workplace environmental, health, and safety issues.\nWe continue to monitor and engage in industry and public policy discussions about related legislative and regulatory changes. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect our business by increasing our costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers.\nIf Congress enacted a law directly regulating insurance, particularly insurer solvency oversight, and state regulators remained responsible for rate approval, we could be subject to a conflicting and inconsistent regulatory framework that could impact our profitability and capital adequacy.\nWhile we underwrite risks only in the U.S., international regulatory developments, particularly in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) related to global capital standards, may influence U.S. regulators as they develop or revise domestic regulatory standards. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors proposed Basic Capital Standards for Global Systemically Important Insurers and a uniform capital framework for internationally active insurers in 2014. Two years later, the EU enacted Solvency II, which established new insurer capital adequacy and risk management requirements intended to reduce the possibility of consumer loss or market disruption by European insurers. Despite these international regulatory changes and continued public policy discussion, RBC remains the NAIC capital adequacy standard. The FIO, in coordination with the Federal Reserve, state regulators, and other regulatory bodies, has been exploring group capital standards. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the NAIC's Group Capital Calculation Working Group adopted the basic structure of its new Group Capital Calculation, along with the model law changes necessary to incorporate it as a requirement for U.S. insurance groups in state law.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, we can provide no assurance that our employees, contractors, or independent distribution partners will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. To some degree, we have multiple regulators whose authority may overlap and may have different interpretations and/or regulations related to the same legal issues. This creates the risk that one regulator's position or interpretation may conflict with another regulator on the same issue. The cost of complying with various, potentially conflicting laws and regulations, and changes in those laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nInsurers are subject to intense regulatory, political, and media scrutiny. We are subject to government market conduct review and investigations, legal actions, and penalties. There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of such examinations, investigations, or media scrutiny in the future. If we are found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is subject to a variety of state, federal, and other laws, rules, policies, and other obligations regarding data protection.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). Federal laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and Federal Trade Commission policies. Several states, like New York, Nevada, and California, have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or creating new rights concerning PII. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant reputational harm, penalties, and legal liability.\nIn the same year that it adopted Solvency II, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"). Effective since 2018 after a two-year implementation period, GDPR regulates data protection and privacy in the EU and transfers of personal data outside the EU. GDPR\u2019s main tenet is to give individuals primary control over their personal data. While GDPR has no direct impact on U.S. companies like us without an EU presence, it and any future EU data privacy actions may influence U.S. regulators over time.\nWe make statements about our use and disclosure of PII through our privacy policy, information provided on our website, and other public statements. If we fail to comply with these public statements or federal, state, and international privacy-related and data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to litigation or governmental actions. Such proceedings could impact our reputation and result in penalties, including ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nWe are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that, because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nWe are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that include:\n\u2022Defense of or indemnity for third-party suits brought against our insureds;\n\u2022Defense of actions brought against us by our insureds who disagree with our coverage decisions, some of which allege bad faith claims handling and seek extra-contractual damages, punitive damages, or other penalties;\n\u2022Actions we file, primarily for declaratory judgment, seeking confirmation that we have made appropriate coverage decisions under our insurance contracts;\n\u2022Actions brought against us or competitors alleging improper business practices and sometimes seeking class status. Such actions historically have included issues and allegations, without limitation, related to (i) unfairly discriminatory underwriting practices, including the impact of credit score usage, (ii) managed care practices, such as provider reimbursement, and (iii) automobile claims practices; and\n\u2022Actions we file against third parties and other insurers for subrogation and recovery of other amounts we paid on behalf of our insureds.\nFrom time-to-time, legal proceedings in which we are involved may receive media attention based on their perceived newsworthiness and/or relationship to a variety of broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends. Such media stories could negatively impact our reputation.\nWe expect that any potential ultimate liability for ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance business will not be material to our consolidated financial condition after considering estimated loss provisions. Litigation outcomes, however, are inherently unpredictable even with meritorious defenses. The time a case is in litigation also is unpredictable, as state court dockets are increasingly overcrowded. Generally, the longer a case is in litigation the more expensive it can become. Because the amounts sought in certain of these actions are large or indeterminate, any adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance\nWe are a holding company, and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders, pay indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated.\nRestrictions on our Insurance Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, make loans or advances to the Parent, or enter into transactions with affiliates may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock and common stock, or repay our indebtedness.\nIn 2021, the Insurance Subsidiaries can provide the Parent with $241 million in ordinary annual dividends under applicable state regulation. Still, their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances is subject to their domiciliary state insurance regulator's approval or review. For additional details regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22. \u201cStatutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe Parent\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its common stockholders is also impacted by covenants in its credit agreement (the \u201cLine of Credit\u201d) among the Parent, the lenders named therein (the \u201cLenders\u201d), and the Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch, as Administrative Agent, that obligate it to, among other things, maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. Under the terms of our Preferred Stock, the Parent's ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of its common stock or any shares of the Parent that rank junior to, or on parity with, the Preferred Stock will be subject to certain restrictions if the Parent does not declare and pay (or set aside) dividends on the Preferred Stock for the last preceding dividend period. For additional details about the Line of Credit\u2019s financial covenants, see Note 11. \u201cIndebtedness\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K. For additional details about conditions related to our Preferred Stock, see Note 17. \"Preferred Stock\" in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBecause we are a New Jersey corporation and an insurance holding company, we may be less attractive to potential acquirers and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are a New Jersey company, and provisions of the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage, delay, or prevent us from being acquired. A supermajority of our shareholders must approve (i) certain business combinations with interested shareholders, or (ii) any amendment to the related provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless certain conditions are met. These conditions may relate to, among other things, the interested stockholder\u2019s acquisition of stock, the approval of the business combination by disinterested members of our Board and disinterested stockholders, and the price and payment of the consideration proposed in the business combination. In addition to considering the effects of any action on our shareholders (including any offer or proposal to acquire the Parent), our Board may consider: (i) the long-term, as well as the short-term, interests of the Parent and our shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may best be served by the continued independence of the Parent; (ii) the effects of the action on the Parent's employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers; and (iii) the effects of the action on the community in which the Parent operates.\nThese provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and New Jersey law could deprive our common shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price in the event of a hostile takeover and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nBecause we own insurance subsidiaries, any party seeking to acquire 10% or more of our common stock must seek prior approval from the subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulators and file extensive information about their business operations and finances.\nRisks Related to Our General Operations\nWe, our distribution partners, and our vendors are subject to attempted cyber-attacks, other cybersecurity risks, and system availability risk.\nOur business heavily relies on IT and application systems that may be accessed from, or are connected to, the Internet. Consequently, a malicious cyber-attack could affect us. Our systems also contain proprietary and confidential information, including PII, about our operations, employees, agents, and customers and their employees and property. A malicious cyber-attack on (i) our systems, (ii) our distribution partners or their key operating systems, and (iii) any other of our third-party partners or vendors and their key operating systems may interrupt our ability to operate, damage our reputation and result in monetary damages that are difficult to quantify, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe have implemented systems and processes, through encryption and authentication technologies, intended to mitigate or secure our IT systems and prevent unauthorized access to, or loss of, sensitive data. Our security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities, as cyber-attacks are continuing to evolve daily. We may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other irregularities. Any disruption or breach of our systems or data security could damage our reputation, result in monetary damages that are difficult to quantify, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. To mitigate this risk, we have and expect to continue to (i) conduct employee education programs and tabletop exercises and (ii) develop and invest in a variety of controls to prevent, detect, and appropriately react to cyber-attacks, including frequently testing our systems' security and access controls. We have insurance coverage for certain cybersecurity risks, including privacy breach incidents, which provides coverage up to $30 million above a $1 million deductible. Such coverage may be insufficient to indemnify all losses or types of claims that may arise.\nIn addition to cyber-attack risk, we face system availability risk. Our business relies heavily on various IT and application systems that may be impacted by an unplanned loss of availability unrelated to malicious cyber-attacks. A failure in one or more systems, including those at facilities where we or our vendors operate systems, may interrupt our ability to operate and negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur long-term strategy to deploy operational leverage is dependent on the success of our risk management strategies, and their failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an insurer, we assume risk from our policyholders. Our long-term strategy includes the use of above-average operational leverage, which can be measured as the ratio of NPW to our equity or policyholders' surplus. We balance and mitigate our operational leverage risk with several risk management strategies within our insurance operations to achieve a balance of growth and profit, including purchasing significant amounts of reinsurance, a disciplined approach to reserving, and a conservative investment philosophy. These strategies have inherent limitations. We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in losses greater than we expect and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.", "PERMNO": 68292, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "SIGI"}
