{"cik": "1515156", "company": "Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks relating to our business\nThe following risks relate to our business as of the date this Report is filed with the SEC, or any alternative date specified. This list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive, but reflects what we believe are the material risks inherent in our business and the ownership of our securities as of the specified dates. A statement to the effect that the occurrence of a specified event may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, profitability, financial condition, or the like, is intended to reflect the fact that such an event would be likely to have a negative impact on your investment in the Company, but should not imply the likelihood of the occurrence of such specified event. The order in which the following risk factors are presented is not intended as an indication of the relative seriousness of any given risk.\nDemand for our products and services depends significantly on environmental laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the future of such laws and regulations, as well as changes to such laws and regulations, or granting of extensions of compliance deadlines has had, and will likely continue to have, a material effect on our business.\nA significant market driver for our existing products and services, and those planned in the future, are present and expected environmental laws and regulations, particularly those addressing the reduction of mercury and other emissions from coal-fired power plants. If such laws and regulations are delayed, or are not enacted or are repealed or amended to be less strict, or include prolonged phase-in periods, or not enforced, our business would be adversely affected by declining demand for such products and services. For example:\n\u2022\nThe implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the EPA has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to do so.\n\u2022\nTo the extent federal, state, and local legislation mandating that electric power generating companies serving a state or region purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal, and such amount lessens demand for electricity from coal-fired plants, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease.\nFederal, state, and international laws or regulations addressing emissions from coal-fired facilities, climate change or other actions to limit emissions, including public opposition to new coal power plants, has caused and could continue to cause electricity generators to transition from coal to other fuel and power sources, such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, hydroelectric and solar. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations or public pressure will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the periods over which those laws or regulations are or will be phased in, the amount of public opposition, and the state and cost of commercial development of related technologies and processes. In addition, Public Utility Commissions (\"PUC's\") may not allow utilities to charge consumers for, and pass on the cost of, emission control technologies without federal or state mandate. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, we cannot reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations or public opposition may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe ability of Tinuum Group to generate revenues from the sale or lease of RC facilities to tax equity investors is not assured, and the inability to sell, lease or operate RC facilities to produce and sell RC and generate Section 45 tax credits could adversely affect our future growth and profitability.\nExcept for RC facilities that Tinuum Group may retain and operate permanently for its own benefit, Tinuum Group is attempting to sell or lease the remaining RC facilities to investors. The inability of Tinuum Group to successfully lease or sell additional RC facilities to third party tax equity investors who will receive the benefit of the Section 45 tax credits that are expected to be generated from those RC facilities, as well as RC facilities that may be returned to Tinuum Group over time, would likely have an adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.\nFurthermore, if in the future electric power generators decide to limit coal-fired generation for economic reasons and/or do not burn and use RC and instead switch to another power or fuel source, Tinuum Group would likely be unable to fully produce the RC and the associated Section 45 tax credits potentially available from RC facilities over the anticipated term of the Section 45 tax credit program. In addition, pursuant to Tinuum Group\u2019s operating agreement, if Tinuum Group is unable to generate enough revenue for cash distributions through the sale or lease of RC facilities over the next five years to return the\nunrecovered investment balance to its Class B Member, GSFS Investments I Corp. (\"GSFS\"), an affiliate of GS, then GSFS may require Tinuum Group to redeem its interest in Tinuum Group for any deficit of such amount not distributed to GSFS. As of December 31, 2016, the unrecovered investment balance inclusive of the 15% annual return was $18.3 million, as shown in the Tinuum Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules (\"Item 15\") of this Report.\nMarket uncertainty created by the lack of guidance and rulings issued by courts and the IRS related to Section 45 tax credits could inhibit Tinuum Group's ability to lease or sell additional RC facilities or require a restructuring of, or result in the termination of, existing arrangements.\nThe availability of Section 45 tax credits, related to the production and sale of RC, to taxpayers investing in RC facilities depends upon a number of factors, including the risk assumed by the taxpayer in the RC facility investment transaction. The law addressing when a taxpayer may and may not be considered the producer and seller of RC and avail itself of Section 45 tax credits is not fully developed and is subject to rulings by courts, interpretations by the IRS and other official pronouncements on tax credit regulations. If rulings, guidance or other pronouncements of courts or the IRS are not definitive or interpreted as allowing the IRS to restrict availability, increase the difficulty, or prohibit or limit the ability of taxpayers to be considered to be the producer and seller of RC and take advantage of Section 45 tax credits, several aspects of our current and future RC business could be adversely impacted. For example, current investors in RC facilities may decide to terminate their existing agreements, or potential investors may reduce the price they are willing to pay or change the structure of the investment to account for perceived risks associated with being considered the producer and seller of RC and the availability of the associated Section 45 tax credits.\nTechnical or operational problems with long-term operation of our RC facilities could result in additional costs and delays that adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur initial RC facilities were operated using CyClean\u2122 technology at cyclone boilers. Tinuum Group began operating RC facilities using the M-45TM technology at circulating fluidized bed (\"CFB\") boilers in 2012 and pulverized coal (\"PC\") boilers in 2013. Given the different technology we use at different types of boilers, the likelihood for technical or operational problems may be increased. Any such problems could result in decreased production of RC at such facilities and/or delays in, or postponement or cancellation of, expected potential future installations and operations at electric power generators and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPresent reliance upon one investor for a substantial portion of our earnings from Tinuum Group and any renegotiation by or loss of this investor or any failure to continue to produce and sell RC at the investor\u2019s RC facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 10 of Tinuum Group\u2019s 28 RC facilities are leased to entities affiliated to GS. Significant components of our total cash flows come from Tinuum Group's distributions relating to payments received under these leases. These leases have an initial fixed period and then automatically renew, unless terminated at the option of the lessee, for successive one-year terms through 2019 or 2021. If these GS related entities renegotiated or terminated their leases, or if the utilities where the RC facilities are installed materially reduce their use of RC, these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Certain GS related entities amended their leases during 2016, with some of the amended leases including less favorable terms to Tinuum Group.\nReduction of coal consumption by U.S. electric power generators could result in less demand for our products and services. If utilities significantly reduce the number of coal fired power plants or the amount of coal burned, without a corresponding increase in the services required at the remaining plants, this could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe amount of coal consumed for U.S. electric power generation is affected by, among other things, (1) the location, availability, quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation, such as natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power; and (2) technological developments, including those related to competing alternative energy sources.\nNatural gas-fueled generation has been displacing and may continue to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. We expect that many of the new power plants needed to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because the price of natural gas has remained at relatively low levels after a period of sharp decline. Gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct, and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain, as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal-fueled generators, and ongoing costs associated with\nmeeting environmental compliance are lower. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make those sources more competitive with coal. Several large U.S.-based banks have publicly indicated they will no longer finance new coal-fired power plants in the U.S., and at least five large coal companies have filed bankruptcy in recent years. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators could reduce the demand for our current products and services, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production, and result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of coal-fired power plants, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in taxation rules or financial accounting standards could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in taxation rules and accounting pronouncements (and changes in interpretations of accounting pronouncements) have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in existing taxation rules, particularly those related to Section 45 tax credits or the ability of taxpayers to benefit from tax credits or net operating loss carryforwards, could have an adverse effect on our reported or future results of operations or financial condition and could also impact our businesses that produce and sell RC and generate Section 45 tax credits.\nAdditionally, changes in future tax rates may occur in the future. A change to existing tax rates could negatively impact tax capacity of current or potential tax equity investors. Additionally, a change to existing tax rates may cause a change related to our current estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we may be able to utilize in future periods.\nOur dependence on third parties for manufacturing key components of our systems may cause delays in deliveries, increased warranty claims and increased costs to us.\nBetween 2012 and 2015, we owned and controlled a manufacturing and assembly facility for our DSI systems. At the end of 2015, manufacturing and assembly operations at that facility were shut down. Like most of our competitors, we currently rely heavily upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and some of the testing of key components for both our ACI and DSI systems. Delays or difficulties in the manufacturing, assembly, or delivery of key components of our ACI and DSI systems could harm our business and financial condition.\nThere are limited sources of acceptable supply for some key ACI and DSI system components. Business disruptions, financial difficulties of suppliers or raw material shortages could increase the costs of our equipment systems sold or reduce the availability of these components. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of required components that meet customer specifications in a timely manner, we could experience significant delays in delivery or increased warranty claims, associated with delivery and product performance. Disruptions of these types could result in the loss of orders or customers or liability for liquidated damages, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the quality and effectiveness of our technologies, products and services do not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, then our sales, results of operations and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impacted.\nIf flaws in the design, production, assembly, delivery, installation, performance or providing of our technologies, products or services (caused by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience substantial liquidated damages, repair, replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation. We have provided warranties and performance guarantees for certain ACI and DSI systems we have sold. Under those contractual arrangements, we are responsible for repair or replacement costs and certain operating costs, within the limits provided by the contracts, if the agreed specifications are not met. Continued improvement in manufacturing capability assessment and quality control, technological development, supply-chain management, product testing, installation, delivery and other costs are critical factors in our future growth and meeting our customers\u2019 expectations. Our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate technologies, designs and processes for the manufacture, production, installation and testing of our products may not be sufficient to avoid failures and meet performance criteria that may result in dissatisfied customers, significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur businesses that are joint ventures are managed under operating agreements where we do not have sole control of the decision making process, and we cannot mandate decisions or ensure outcomes.\nWe oversee our joint ventures under the terms of their operating agreements by participating in the following activities: (1) representation on the respective governing boards of directors, (2) regular oversight of financial and operational performance and controls and establishing audit and reporting requirements, (3) hiring of management personnel, (4) technical support of RC facilities, and (5) other regular and routine involvement with our joint venture partners. Notwithstanding this regular participation and oversight, our joint venture partners also participate in the management of these businesses and they may have business or economic interests that divert their attention from the joint venture, or they may prefer to operate the business, make decisions or invest resources in a manner that is contrary to our preferences. Since material business decisions must be made jointly with our joint venture partners, we cannot mandate decisions or ensure outcomes.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or infringement of our intellectual property by a third party could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate because they provide only limited protection. We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, many of our customers and many of our vendors, and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Notwithstanding these measures, a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology and intellectual property, which could result in injury to our business and financial condition. In addition, such actions by third parties would divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties that are costly to defend and that may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies.\nCompanies in the business of developing technology face the risk of being subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend. As a company involved in developing and commercializing new technologies, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties, the defense of which would likely be costly in terms of monetary expenses and management demands. If our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from continuing sales of existing products or services and from pursuing research, development or commercialization of new or complimentary products or services. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses to third party intellectual property, or be forced to develop or obtain alternative technologies. Our failure to obtain a license to a technology that we may require, or to develop or obtain alternative technologies, could significantly and negatively affect our business.\nAgreements to indemnify third party licensees of our technologies against intellectual property infringement claims concerning our licensed technology and our products could be significant to us.\nWe have agreed to indemnify licensees of our technologies (including Tinuum Group and Arch Coal, Inc.) and purchasers of our products and we may enter into additional agreements with others under which we agree to indemnify and hold the third party harmless from and against losses it may incur as a result of the infringement of third party rights caused by the use of our technologies and products. Infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming to defend, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, even if we are successful in defending ourselves (and indemnified parties) against them.\nOur future success depends in part on our ongoing identification and development of intellectual property and our ability to invest in and deploy new products, services and technologies into the marketplace efficiently and cost effectively.\nThe process of identifying customer needs and developing and enhancing products, services and solutions for our business segments is complex, costly and uncertain. Any failure by us to identify and anticipate changing needs, emerging trends and new regulations could significantly harm our future market share and results of operations. Historically, our approach to technology development, implementation and commercialization of products has focused on quickly taking technology to full-scale testing and enhancing it under actual power plant operating conditions. We continue to review and adjust methods to deploy products, services and technologies to our customers. We may focus our resources on technologies, services or products that are not widely accepted or commercially viable, or on operational processes that are not profitable, even after significant up-front investment of our resources, such as occurred with the shut-down of ADA Analytics, LLC, ADA Analytics Israel Ltd. (collectively, \"ADA Analytics\") and BCSI, LLC. Our results are subject to risks related to our investments in new technologies,\nbut if we are unable to develop and scale up new technologies, products, and services to meet the needs of our customers, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nThe effects of providing warranties and performance guarantees for our equipment and chemical sales or Tinuum Group providing payment and performance guarantees of its RC facilities are largely unknown and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nProviding warranties on equipment and chemicals that generally do not extend beyond 12 months from the installation date and delivery date, respectively, have been and will likely continue to be an integral part of successful sales of our products and services. Providing certain performance guarantees during a discrete performance testing period that generally do not extend beyond six months from the initial test date have been and will likely continue to be an integral part of successful sales of our products and services. Guarantees with respect to our ACI and DSI systems typically require the equipment to meet stated injection rates of a specified or approved absorbent or alkali material. In some cases, guarantees might require that emissions of certain pollutants (such as mercury) be reduced by a specified amount if certain operating parameters of the generating facility, including the nature of the coal burned, are met. Such guarantees sometimes require us to spend amounts up to the value of the sales contract to \u201cmake right\u201d the performance of the ACI or DSI system, or subject us to liquidated damages if the guaranteed level of performance is not achieved. In 2014, 2015 and 2016 under certain contracts, we provided customers with more stringent performance guarantees and higher cost related remedies. Although we believe compliance with these more stringent guarantees is probable, these stronger guarantees and customer remedies place us at greater risk and may also require us to delay revenue recognition on such contracts. In addition to performance guarantees on ACI and DSI systems we sell, Tinuum Group indemnifies certain utilities and lessees of RC facilities for particular risks associated with the operations of those facilities. We have provided limited, joint and several guarantees of Tinuum Group\u2019s obligations under those leases. Any substantial payments made under such guarantees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaterial adjustments pursuant to DOE audits of our past performance could have a detrimental impact on our business.\nCertain of our completed and current contracts awarded by the DOE and related industry participants remain subject to government audits. Our historical experience with these audits has not resulted in significant adverse adjustments to reimbursement amounts previously received; however audits for the years 2010 and later have not been finalized. If the results of future audits require us to repay material amounts, our results of operations and business would likely suffer material adverse impacts.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely upon information technology (\"IT\") to manage and conduct business, both internally and with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data including, in certain instances, customer and supplier business information. Therefore, maintaining the security of computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and to respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our IT systems and security measures as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third party liabilities.\nWe have made and may make future acquisitions or form partnerships and joint ventures that may involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur strategy may include expanding our scope of products and services organically or through selective acquisitions, investments or creating partnerships and joint ventures. We have acquired, and may selectively acquire, other businesses,\nproduct or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms, or we may be unable to integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively and efficiently and may need to divest those acquisitions as we did with our acquired operations in ADA Analytics and BCSI, LLC. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others:\n\u2022\nintegration difficulties, including challenges and costs associated with implementing systems and processes to comply with requirements of being part of a publicly-traded company;\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities or operating challenges;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to properly establish and maintain effective internal controls over an acquired company; and\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on our operational and IT systems.\nAlthough we have conducted what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of acquisitions we have made, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating results and financial condition. Until we assume operating control of these acquisitions, we may not be able to ascertain their actual value, costs or exposures to liabilities. This is particularly true with respect to acquisitions outside the U.S.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our loan agreements contain certain covenants that limit, or that may have the effect of limiting, among other things acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects and our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control. Our equipment and chemical orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit us to recover our costs incurred through termination. If a customer cancels an order, we have to recognize our costs and revenues immediately, and may not achieve the full amount of our backlog. If projects are delayed, the timing to recognize our revenues, particularly when using the completed contract method of accounting, will be adversely impacted and projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Revenue recognition may occur over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays and quarterly fluctuations, which may also impact quarterly backlog. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues.\nWe may be unable to renew our bank line of credit agreement upon maturity.\nOur bank line of credit (\"Line of Credit\") agreement matures on September 30, 2017 and it is primarily used to support current and future letters of credit that are not supported by cash collateral. If we are unable to extend the Line of Credit, we may have to utilize existing cash resources to support letters of credit.\nInability to prepare and timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital and could result in increased transaction costs.\nWe are required to comply with Section 13 of the Exchange Act. For the period beginning December 31, 2013 through September 30, 2015, we did not file current Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q. Because we did not remain current in our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, we have been, and continue to be, limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. Our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from implementing business strategies that we may otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. Until one year after the date, April 19, 2016, we maintain compliance with the filing requirements of the Exchange Act, we will be ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings, such as Form S\u00ad-3 under the Securities Act, to register our securities for sale. We may use Form S-1 under the Securities Act to register a sale of our stock to raise capital, but doing so would likely increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital in a timely manner.\nRisks relating to our common stock\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly. The market price of our common stock may continue to be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nTinuum Group\u2019s ability to lease or sell RC facilities;\n\u2022\nannouncements of sales awards;\n\u2022\nchanges in supply and demand of components and materials;\n\u2022\nadoption of new tax regulations or accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nperceptions of the value of corporate transactions; and\n\u2022\nthe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions.\nFrom December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2016, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $3.27 to $27.90 per share (retroactively restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split of our common stock, which was effected in the form of a common stock dividend distributed on March 14, 2014). Significant declines in the price of our common stock could impede our ability to obtain additional capital and attract and retain qualified employees, and could reduce the liquidity of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of similarly staged companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\nlimit the business at special meetings to the purpose stated in the notice of the meeting;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; and\n\u2022\nrequire the affirmative vote of the \"disinterested\" holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an \"interested stockholder\" or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria or procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our \"continuing directors\" (known as \"fair price provisions\").\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.", "PERMNO": 90400, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ADES"}
