Risk Factors.\nThe following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations. In this section, we first provide a summary of the more significant risks and uncertainties we face and then provide a full set of risk factors and discuss them in greater detail.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\n\u2022We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses and have never generated revenue from product sales; we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never be profitable.\n\u2022We will need to raise additional funding to advance our product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and may dilute existing shareholders or restrict our operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\n\u2022Our approach to the discovery and development of our product candidates may never lead to marketable products.\n\u2022We may encounter substantial delays in our clinical studies, or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in the development of our compounds.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt our business, including our clinical development activities.\n\u2022We could encounter difficulties in enrolling participants in our clinical studies, which could delay or prevent progress of our product candidates.\n\u2022The FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and unable to generate product revenue.\n\u2022Our product candidates may cause side effects that may result in label restrictions.\n\u2022We may have to change our nonclinical or clinical study protocols due to regulatory reasons or unanticipated events, which could result in increased costs to us and could delay our development timeline.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\n\u2022Akebia may not be successful in developing any therapies through the praliciguat out-license with the Company.\n\u2022We may enter into a collaboration or license arrangement in the future that ultimately is not successful.\n\u2022We rely, and expect that we will continue to rely, on third parties to conduct nonclinical or clinical studies and to manufacture drug supplies for our product candidates. If these third parties do not execute successfully, our business could be substantially harmed.\n\u2022We share confidential information with third-party vendors, including trade secrets and know-how, which increases the possibility that our confidential information will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\n\u2022We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary technologies or obtain and maintain issued patents that are sufficient to protect our product candidates.\n\u2022We may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts.\n\u2022We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\n\u2022We may not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\n\u2022We may not be able to obtain additional protection under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, and similar foreign legislation by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for our product candidates.\n\u2022We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers.\nRisks Related to the Future Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\n\u2022If the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be harmed.\n\u2022Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, they may not achieve broad market acceptance by patients, physicians and healthcare payors, which would limit our revenue.\n\u2022We may fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations and could face substantial penalties.\n\u2022Our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are safer, more advanced or more effective than ours.\n\u2022The impact of healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\n\u2022Our prospects for success depend on our ability to retain our management team and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\n\u2022We may need to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing growth of our employee base.\n\u2022We face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\n\u2022We could fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls and our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired.\n\u2022Our internal computer systems, or those of our third-party CROs, CMOs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product candidates' development programs.\n\u2022If we or any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur.\n\u2022We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nRisks Related to the Separation\n\u2022Our rights under the intellectual property license agreement with Ironwood could be challenged.\n\u2022We may be required to make payments to indemnify Ironwood for certain liabilities in connection with the Separation.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022We have limited trading history and a relatively low-volume trading market for our shares and our market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\n\u2022Our common stock market price is particularly volatile, and we expect it to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer.\n\u2022We may not attract securities or industry analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our stock; analysts may publish negative reports or change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely and our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\u2022We have adopted anti-takeover provisions in our articles of organization and bylaws and are subject to provisions of Massachusetts law that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current board of directors or to effect a change of control or other business combination involving our company.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nAs we are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale, valuing our business and predicting our prospects is challenging.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that was incorporated in 2018. Our business was conducted within Ironwood prior to that time, and we had no history as an independent company prior to the completion of the Separation. We are developing a pipeline of sGC stimulators, but we have no products approved for commercial sale, and we have never generated revenue from product sales. Our operating activities to date have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, pursuing partnership opportunities and conducting early-stage clinical trials for our product candidates, including CY6463.\nTo date, we have not obtained marketing approval for any of our product candidates, engaged, on our own or through a third party, in commercial scale manufacturing, or conducted sales and marketing activities necessary for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Our short operating history offers limited insight into our prospects for success or even viability. We expect our operating performance to fluctuate. We will encounter challenges frequently experienced by early-stage biopharmaceutical companies in rapidly evolving fields and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully navigate such challenges. If we do not successfully address the challenges we face, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nOur business has incurred significant losses and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We have never generated revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nOur business has incurred operating losses due to costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $51.6 million and $77.8 million, respectively. We expect to\nincur significant losses for several years, as we continue our research activities and conduct development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenue from our product candidates and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic partners, to complete the development of, and obtain the necessary regulatory and essential pricing and reimbursement approvals to commercialize, our product candidates. We do not know when, if ever, we will generate revenues from sales of our products.\nOur expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to perform clinical and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we may never generate revenue in amounts sufficient to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe will need to raise additional funding to advance our product candidates, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. Raising additional capital may dilute our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or cause us to relinquish valuable rights.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $54.0 million. Our management believes that such cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current priorities, including the ADv, CIAS, and MELAS studies. However, we will require significant additional funding to advance our product candidates, alone or with strategic partners, through clinical studies and to seek marketing approval, as well as to continue advancing our research and development efforts with our other product candidates. We may also need to raise additional funds sooner than currently anticipated if we choose to pursue additional indications or geographies for our product candidates, identify additional product candidates to advance through clinical development or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution.\nWe are seeking funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, and such agreements may impact rights to our product candidates or technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Such arrangements will limit our participation in the success of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval.\nWe may also seek to raise such capital through public or private equity, royalty financing or debt financing. Raising funds in the then-current economic environment may be challenging, and such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all. The terms of any financing may harm existing shareholders. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. Incurring debt would result in increased fixed payment obligations, and we may agree to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights that could impede our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to raise capital when needed or on reasonable terms, we may curtail, delay or discontinue our research or development programs, scale back or cease any commercialization efforts or wind down our business. In addition, such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may impede our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur approach to the discovery and development of product candidates for the treatment of serious CNS diseases may never lead to marketable products.\nWe are focusing our research and development efforts on addressing serious CNS disorders. The development of CNS therapies presents unique challenges, including an imperfect understanding of the biology, the presence of the blood-brain barrier that can restrict the flow of drugs to the brain, a frequent lack of translatability of nonclinical study results in subsequent clinical trials and dose selection, and the product candidate having an effect that may be too small to be detected using the outcome measures selected in clinical trials or if the outcomes measured do not reach statistical significance. There are few effective therapeutic options available for patients with MELAS and ADv and other CNS disorders. Our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of our technology and our product candidates for treating CNS. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing our product candidates is both preliminary and limited. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates, we will not become profitable and the value of our common stock may decline.\nWe are currently pursuing clinical development activities for CY6463, and next generation compound, CY3018. Research and development of biopharmaceutical products is inherently risky. We may encounter substantial delays in our clinical studies, or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities in the development of CY6463 and CY3018 to treat patients with serious diseases of the central nervous system.\nOur business depends heavily on the successful development, clinical testing, regulatory approvals and commercialization of our lead product candidates. On October 14, 2020, we announced topline results from our Phase 1 translational pharmacology study of CY6463, the first sGC stimulator in clinical development for CNS disorders, which supported the ongoing development of CY6463 in serious CNS diseases. The Company also announced its focus on discovering, developing and commercializing innovative medicines for people with serious diseases of the CNS. Although we have several product candidates, CY6463 and CY3018 are the only product candidates we are now developing internally. CY6463, CY3018. and any of our other current or potential product candidates, will require regulatory approvals based on substantial additional development and testing prior to commercialization.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive nonclinical and clinical studies that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Each product candidate must demonstrate an adequate benefit-risk profile for its intended use in its intended patient population. In some instances, significant variability in safety or efficacy appear in different clinical studies of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in study protocols, differences in the number and characteristics of the enrolled study participants, variations in the dosing regimen and other clinical study parameters or the dropout rate among study participants. Product candidates in later stages of clinical studies often fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy despite promising nonclinical testing and early clinical studies. Companies in the biopharmaceutical industry often suffer significant setbacks in later-stage clinical studies; most product candidates that begin clinical studies are never approved for commercialization by regulatory authorities. Favorable results in earlier stage trials, such as the topline results from CY6463\u2019s Phase 1 translational pharmacology study may not be replicated in later stage trials. If we fail to produce positive results in our clinical trials of CY6463, the development timeline, regulatory approval and commercialization prospects of CY6463 and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our business, including our clinical development activities.\nMany nations, including the United States, continue to implement stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and other limiting measures to contain the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that, along with other related mitigation measures, has limited and may continue to limit our ability to access patients and physicians at certain local clinical centers that are participating in our development activities. To a limited extent, the pandemic delayed and disrupted our recently completed studies.\nWe may continue to face limitations and difficulties enrolling patients in our planned and future clinical trials if the patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials continue to be affected by the coronavirus and/or the COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 restrictions and/or COVID-19 vaccination efforts at trial sites could delay our clinical studies. In addition, if the patients enrolled in our clinical trials become infected with COVID-19, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials as a result. Vulnerable patients, including patients with serious diseases of the CNS, such as the patients enrolling in our clinical trials, may be at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and may experience more severe symptoms from the disease, adversely affecting our chances for regulatory approval or requiring further clinical studies. The adverse effects that may occur from administration of COVID-19 vaccines to patients participating in our clinical trials may adversely affect our clinical trial outcomes or data analysis. Furthermore, the extent to which the pandemic, or future outbreaks of infectious disease, hinders access to facilities, procurement of resources, raw materials or components necessary for research studies or preclinical or clinical development is not fully predictable. Delays and disruptions from the pandemic, or future outbreaks of infectious disease, may increase our capital needs while potentially interfering with our access to capital.\nIf we encounter difficulties in enrolling participants in our clinical studies, we could be delayed or prevented from proceeding with clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying participants to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit participants to participate in testing our product candidates. Estimates of the prevalence of our target indications vary considerably. Determining the incidence of these conditions, including in specific geographies or demographic groups, is challenging. The lower the actual prevalence of these conditions, the more challenges we will encounter enrolling participants in our clinical studies, which could delay development of our product candidates. Clinical trial enrollment may also encounter difficulties for a variety of other reasons. The number of participants eligible for a clinical trial may be substantially limited by stringent eligibility criteria in a study protocol, such as the inclusion of biomarker-driven identification or other highly specific criteria related to stage of disease progression or to specific patient reported outcome measures. The number of participants required to power the statistical analysis of the study's endpoints may be very large leading to an extended enrollment period. Issues such as the proximity of participants to a study site, the complexity of the study design, our ability to recruit investigators with appropriate skill and experience, competing clinical studies for similar therapies or targeting similar participants, perceptions of the benefit-risk profile of the product candidate relative to other available therapies or product candidates, and ability to obtain and maintain institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee, or EC, approvals and participant consents all could have a substantial impact on the timing of clinical trial enrollment. If we are unable to enroll sufficient participants in clinical studies in a timely way, obtaining study results will be delayed, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe cannot commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical studies and depends upon numerous factors, including the type and complexity of the product candidates involved. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept an application for review or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional nonclinical, clinical, or other information (e.g., product quality data or manufacturing controls). We have not requested or obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur ongoing clinical studies may not be completed on schedule, and our planned clinical studies may not begin on schedule, if at all. The completion or commencement of clinical studies can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022the FDA or other regulatory bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence planned clinical studies, or require that we suspend ongoing clinical studies through imposition of clinical holds;\n\u2022negative results from our ongoing studies or other industry studies involving product candidates modulating the same or similar mechanism of action;\n\u2022delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to considerable negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and study sites;\n\u2022inadequate quantity or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies, for example delays in the manufacturing of sufficient supply of finished drug product;\n\u2022difficulties obtaining EC or IRB approval(s) to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site or sites;\n\u2022challenges in recruiting and enrolling participants in clinical studies, the proximity of participants to study sites, eligibility criteria for the clinical study, the nature of the clinical study protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical study programs for similar indications;\n\u2022severe or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in a clinical study;\n\u2022the presence of unanticipated metabolites in participants in a clinical study may require considerable nonclinical and clinical assessment;\n\u2022we may decide, or regulatory authorities may require us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022delays in validating, or inability to validate, any endpoints utilized in a clinical study;\n\u2022the FDA or other regulatory bodies may disagree with our clinical study design and our interpretation of data from clinical studies, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical studies;\n\u2022reports from nonclinical or clinical testing of other competing candidates that raise safety or efficacy concerns; and\n\u2022difficulties retaining participants who have enrolled in a clinical study but may be prone to withdraw due to rigors of the clinical studies, lack of efficacy, side effects, personal issues, or loss of interest.\nClinical studies may also be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other comparable authorities, the IRBs or ECs overseeing a clinical study, a data and safety monitoring board overseeing the clinical study, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022failure to conduct the clinical study in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022inspection of the clinical study operations or study sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that reveals deficiencies or violations that require us to undertake corrective action, including in response to the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022unforeseen safety issues, including any that could be identified in our ongoing studies, adverse side effects or lack of effectiveness;\n\u2022changes in government regulations or administrative actions;\n\u2022problems with clinical supply materials; and\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue clinical studies.\nOur product candidates may cause side effects that are presented in the product labeling approved by regulatory authorities. Some may result in label restrictions.\nThe most commonly reported adverse events in the repeat-dose clinical studies for CY6463 were headache and GI-related symptoms, most commonly dyspepsia. As with ADEMPAS\u00ae (riociguat), the only FDA-approved sGC stimulator to date, CY6463 may cause serious birth defects if taken while pregnant, and our clinical studies require stringent contraceptive safeguards to prevent pregnancy. These side effects and any other undesirable side effects observed with our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in restrictive label language or delay or denial of regulatory approval.\nChanges in regulatory requirements, FDA guidance or unanticipated events during our nonclinical studies and clinical studies of our product candidates may occur, which may result in changes to nonclinical or clinical study protocols or additional nonclinical or clinical study requirements, which could result in increased costs to us and could delay our development timeline.\nChanges in regulatory requirements, FDA guidance or unanticipated events during our nonclinical studies and clinical studies may force us to amend nonclinical studies and clinical study protocols or the FDA may impose additional nonclinical studies and clinical study requirements. Amendments or changes to our clinical study protocols would require resubmission to the FDA and IRBs for review and approval, which may increase the cost or delay the timing or successful completion of clinical studies. Similarly, amendments to our nonclinical studies may increase the cost or delay the timing or successful completion of those nonclinical studies. If we experience delays completing, or if we terminate, any of our nonclinical or clinical studies, or if we are required to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical studies, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nIn order to market any product outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with the numerous and varying safety, efficacy and other regulatory requirements of other countries. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional nonclinical or clinical studies, as studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The marketing approval processes in other countries may implicate all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our product candidates is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or other setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to market our product candidates in such countries. Any such impairment would reduce the size of our potential market, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nData/market exclusivity may be more limited than we expect based upon the competitive landscape and other factors outside of our control that may occur during development or after approval\nThere are many types of data/market exclusivity mechanisms that we may seek to secure for our product candidates. Many of these have risk of loss of exclusivity if the competitive landscape changes or regulations are revised. If we seek and are awarded orphan drug designation in the US and/or the EU based upon criteria in effect at the time, this designation may be rescinded if a similar drug or another therapy that confers a significant benefit over ours is subsequently approved. If our product candidates were to fail to obtain orphan drug status, or lose such status after it is obtained, or the marketing exclusivity that such status provides, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. There are other types of data/market exclusivity rights granted after approval that may not confer exclusivity anticipated if the competitive landscape changes and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nAkebia may not be successful in developing any therapies through the praliciguat out-license and we may not realize any eligible revenue from the out-license.\nOn June 3, 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Akebia relating to the exclusive worldwide license to Akebia of our rights to the development, manufacture, medical affairs and commercialization of pharmaceutical products containing the pharmaceutical compound praliciguat and other related products and forms thereof enumerated in such agreement. Under the agreement, Akebia will be responsible for all future research, development, regulatory, and commercialization activities for certain products. Cyclerion is eligible to receive up to $15 million in the first 18 months of the term. Further milestone cash payments by Akebia are scheduled in the Agreement based on the initiation of phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. for such products for first and second indication, for FDA approvals, for approvals in certain other major markets, and for certain sales milestones. In addition to these cash milestone payments, Akebia will pay Cyclerion tiered royalty payments on net sales in certain major markets at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the high-teens, subject to certain reductions and offsets. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event a material breach by the other party, by us in the event of certain patent disputes or the failure by Akebia to initiate phase 2 clinical trials within a set period of time, and by Akebia, subject to a notice period, at any time after one year from the effective date. There can be no assurances that the agreement will result in any therapies or that it will not be terminated prior to the realization by us of any remaining eligible revenues.\nAny collaboration or license arrangements that we enter into in the future may not be successful, which could impede our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe intend to seek collaboration or license arrangements for the commercialization, and/or potentially for the development, of certain of our product candidates depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into collaboration or license arrangements. We will face significant challenges in seeking appropriate partners. Moreover, collaboration and license arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations, licenses or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nAny future collaboration or license arrangements that we enter into may not be successful. The success of such arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our partners. Collaboration and license arrangements are subject to numerous risks, including that:\n\u2022partners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations;\n\u2022a partner with marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to or otherwise not perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities;\n\u2022partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation\nthat could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022collaboration and license arrangements may be terminated, and, if terminated, this may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable current or future product candidates;\n\u2022partners may own or co-own intellectual property covering products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property;\n\u2022disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaboration or license arrangements; and\n\u2022a partner\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nWe rely, and expect that we will continue to rely, on third parties to conduct any nonclinical or clinical studies for our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe do not have the infrastructure or internal resources and capabilities to independently conduct nonclinical or clinical studies. We rely on contract laboratories, medical institutions, clinical investigators, and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct nonclinical studies on our discovery compounds and product candidates and clinical studies on product candidates. We rely heavily on such parties for execution of nonclinical and clinical studies and can control only certain aspects of their activities. As a result, we have less direct control over the conduct, timing and completion of our nonclinical and clinical studies and the management of data developed through these studies than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Communicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. Outside parties may have staffing difficulties, fail to comply with contractual obligations, experience regulatory compliance issues, undergo changes in priorities, become financially distressed or form relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors.\nThese factors may materially impede the willingness or ability of third parties to complete quality nonclinical and clinical studies and may subject us to unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our nonclinical and clinical studies is conducted in accordance with any applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific requirements and standards, and our reliance on CROs and other third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We, our CROs and other third parties are required to comply with regulations and guidelines, such as good laboratory practices (GLPs), good clinical practices (GCPs), and current Good Manufacturing Practices. These regulations are enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA enforces compliance to regulations through periodic inspections of clinical study sponsors, principal investigators, and third parties. If the FDA determines there was a failure to comply with the regulations the clinical data generated in our clinical studies may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical studies before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our nonclinical studies, clinical studies or product manufacturing complies with these regulations. Our failure or the failure of our CROs to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical studies, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties.\nAlthough we design or approve the designs of our product candidate clinical studies, CROs conduct all of the clinical studies. As a result, many important aspects of the execution of our drug development programs are outside of our direct control. In addition, the CROs may not perform all of their obligations under arrangements with us or in compliance with regulatory requirements, but we remain responsible and are subject to enforcement action that may include civil penalties and criminal prosecution for any violations of FDA laws and regulations during the conduct of our clinical studies. If the CROs do not perform clinical studies in a satisfactory manner, breach their\nobligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the development and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or our development program materially and irreversibly harmed. We may fail to control the amount and timing of resources these CROs devote to our program or our clinical products. If we are unable to rely on clinical data collected by our CROs, we could be required to repeat, extend the duration of, or increase the size of our clinical studies and this could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any clinical studies such CROs are associated with may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, we believe that our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates in the approved indication would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe rely completely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our nonclinical and clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any product candidates that are approved.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to internally manufacture the drug supply of our product candidates, or any future product candidates, for use in the conduct of our nonclinical and clinical studies. We lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on any scale. We depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our future and/or ongoing nonclinical studies and clinical trials of CY6463. We do not have long-term supply agreements in place with our CMOs and each batch of our product candidates is individually contracted under a services agreement on a purchase order basis. We expect to continue to rely on CMOs for the supply of CY6463 for later-stage development and commercialization, as well as for the supply of any other discovery compounds or product candidates that we may identify, and we may not be able to enter into long-term supply agreements with such CMOs on favorable terms. As a further result, we are subject to price fluctuations for our clinical drug supplies. If the prices charged by these CMOs increase, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. We apply industry risk management practices to minimize the impact to nonclinical and clinical timelines associated with delays to our clinical supplies. However, these delays could still lead to clinical trials delays that could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, the facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product must complete a pre-approval inspection by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies to assess compliance with applicable requirements, including current GMP, after we submit our new drug application, or NDA, or relevant foreign regulatory submission to the applicable regulatory agency. If the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory agency determines now or in the future that these facilities are noncompliant, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would impede our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our confidential information, including trade secrets and know-how, which increases the possibility that our confidential information will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and because we collaborate with various CROs and other third parties to conduct our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, we must, at times, share our trade secrets or know-how with them. We seek to protect our confidential information, including know-how and trade secrets, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors and consultants prior to beginning our collaborations or disclosing confidential information to such parties. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets and know-how. Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share our confidential information with third parties increases the risk that confidential information such as trade secrets and know-how becomes\nknown by our competitors, is inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or is disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our confidential information including know-how and trade secrets, a competitor's discovery of our confidential information or other unauthorized use or disclosure could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technologies, or obtain and maintain issued patents that are sufficient to protect our product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection in the United States and other countries for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, should they issue, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business.\nWe have twenty-one issued U.S. patents, thirty pending U.S. patents applications (of which eight are in the provisional stage), three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application, and numerous foreign patents and pending patent applications.\nOur issued US patents covering 6463 expire in 2037, subject to patent term extension. Our issued U.S. and foreign patents covering olinciguat expire between 2031 and 2037 and our issued U.S. and foreign patents covering praliciguat and related compounds expire between 2031 and 2037, in each case subject to patent term extensions. Multiple pending U.S. and foreign patents applications covering different aspects of CY6463, praliciguat, and olinciguat will expire between 2031 and 2041, subject to patent term extensions. See \u201cBusiness - Intellectual Property.\u201d We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, involve complex legal and factual questions, which in recent years have been the subject of much litigation, and, therefore, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Our pending patent applications may not be granted as issued patents in any particular jurisdiction and, even if they do, these patents may not include claims with a sufficient scope to protect our product candidates or otherwise provide any competitive advantage.\nEven if our patent applications are issued, competitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents and other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to prevent infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations\nMoreover, our patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented in the United States and abroad. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference, derivation, ex-parte reexamination, post-grant review, or inter-partes review proceedings, supplemental examination and challenges in district court. Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our involvement in litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs, and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference or derivation\nproceeding can result in a third party receiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to develop, market or otherwise commercialize our product candidates.\nPatents may also be subjected to opposition, post-grant review or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices or courts. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or competitive products. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents, should they issue, that we may own or exclusively license may not provide any protection against competitors.\nFurthermore, though a patent, if it were to issue, is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate protection to exclude competitors from making similar products. Even if a patent issues and is held to be valid and enforceable, competitors may be able to design around or circumvent our patents, such as by using pre-existing or newly developed technology or products in a non-infringing manner. If these developments were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, even if we were to prevail, would be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents, if and when issued, put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or not infringed, or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid, not infringed or unenforceable. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions of a patent include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent application that matured into the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution of the patent application. In an infringement proceeding, a court may disagree with our allegations and refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question, or may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable. An adverse result in any litigation, defense or post-grant proceedings could result in one or more of our patents being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates.\nIf any of our patents, if and when issued, covering our product candidates are invalidated or found not infringed or unenforceable, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates, if approved.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. Other parties may allege that our product candidates or the use of our technologies infringes or otherwise violates patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be\nthird-party patents or patent applications with claims to compositions, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by our technologies.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Patent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and their outcome is uncertain and cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either does not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court, or redesign our products. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us and we could not obtain such a license, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our product candidates. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney's fees if we are found to be willfully infringing another party's patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license.\nAny of these risks coming to fruition could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nOur employees, consultants, non-academic outside scientific collaborators and other advisors enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with us or have entered into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with Ironwood. We seek to have inventions assigned to us by the parties rendering services whenever possible. However, we may not be able to enter into these agreements with all parties (for example with academic collaborators) or these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property, or we may have to in-license intellectual property owned by another party. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions over the lifetime of our owned patents and applications. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors or other third parties might be able to enter the market earlier\nthan would otherwise have been the case and this circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\nThe statutory deadlines for pursuing patent protection in individual foreign jurisdictions are based on the priority date of each of our patent applications and we may not timely file foreign patent applications. Thus, for each of the patent families that we believe provide coverage for our product candidates, we will need to decide whether and where to pursue protection outside the United States. Filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending patents on product candidates in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and so we are unlikely to pursue and maintain patents in all countries worldwide. As such, competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we do not pursue and obtain patent protection to develop their own products.\nThe laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States even if we have a patent in that jurisdiction. Further, a competitor may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Even if we pursue and obtain issued patents in particular jurisdictions, our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent third parties from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnology or pharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of or marketing of competing products in violation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we do not obtain additional protection under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, and similar foreign legislation by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of the U.S. patents we own may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A maximum of five years can be restored to the eligible patent. In all cases, the total patent life for the product with the patent extension cannot exceed 14 years from the product's approval date, or in other words, 14 years of potential marketing time. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to\napply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the duration of patent protection we obtain for our product candidates may not provide us with any meaningful commercial or competitive advantage, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products earlier than they would otherwise be able to do so, and our ability to generate revenues could be harmed.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation: the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These provisions affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. It is not yet clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain future patents, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on these and other decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce any patents that may issue in the future.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers.\nOur employees may have been previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We also engage advisors and consultants who are concurrently employed at universities or who perform services for other entities.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees, advisors or consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third party. We may be subject to claims that an employee, advisor or consultant performed work for us that conflicts with that person's obligations to a third party, such as an employer, and thus, that the third party has an ownership interest in the intellectual property arising out of work performed for us. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our commercial development efforts.\nRisks Related to the Future Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe incidence and prevalence for target patient populations of our product candidates have not been established with precision. If the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we estimate, or if any approval that we obtain is based on a narrower definition of the patient population, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be harmed.\nThe incidence and prevalence for all the conditions we aim to address with our programs vary considerably. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these\ndiseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new trials may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The total addressable market across all of our product candidates will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the diagnosis criteria included in the final label for each of our product candidates, if approved for sale for these indications, acceptance by the medical community and patient access, drug pricing and reimbursement. The number of patients in the United States and other major markets and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would harm our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are very small, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any product candidates, if approved, we may not be successful in commercializing those product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not currently have an infrastructure for the sale, marketing, market access, patient service and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to market our product candidates, if approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority outside the United States, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities, or arrange with third parties to perform these services. There are risks involved with both establishing our own commercial capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force or reimbursement specialists is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product candidate launch. If commercialization is delayed or does not occur, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred such expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our commercialization personnel.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, commercial support and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability of product revenue may be lower than if we were to market and sell any products we may develop ourselves. In addition, we may fail to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish commercialization capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, or if we are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if approved and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our product candidates may not achieve broad market acceptance by patients, physicians, healthcare payors or others in the medical community, which would limit the revenue that we generate from their sales.\nThe future commercial success of our product candidates, if approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities outside the United States, will depend upon the awareness and acceptance of our product candidates among the medical community, including patients, physicians and healthcare payors. If any of our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by patients, physicians, healthcare payors and others in the medical community, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become, or remain, profitable. Market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022the efficacy and safety of our approved product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022the clinical indications and labeling claims for our product candidates that are approved;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved for our product candidates by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications or restrictions on the use of our products in certain types of patients;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022the size of the target patient population, and the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022the safety, efficacy, cost and other potential advantages of our approved product candidates compared to other available therapies;\n\u2022our ability to generate cost effectiveness data that supports a profitable price;\n\u2022our ability to obtain sufficient reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of sufficient payor coverage;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies; or\n\u2022publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments.\nIf our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by patients, physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue from our product candidates to become or remain profitable. Before granting reimbursement approval, healthcare payors may require us to demonstrate that our product candidates, in addition to treating these target indications, also provide incremental health benefits to patients. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors about the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably. Price controls may be imposed in certain markets, which may harm our future profitability.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any approved product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and government authorities and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a product is: a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We or our partners may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products. In addition, in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.\nIn some countries, particularly member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European\nUnion member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we or our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe product candidates that we are evaluating in clinical studies are subject to certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our business. These laws and regulations include:\n\u2022federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, as an inducement or reward for their past, current or potential future prescribing, purchase, use, recommending for use, referral, formulary placement, or dispensing of our products;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device research, development, and marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing or promoting such products prior to approval; and\n\u2022state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback laws, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members of the healthcare industry and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. For example, if we conduct clinical studies in any of the member states of the European Union, the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is subject to the 1995 Data Protection Directive, imposing strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, took effect, increasing our obligations with respect to clinical studies conducted in the EEA and increasing the scrutiny applied by clinical study sites located in the EEA to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The compliance obligations imposed by the GDPR may increase our cost of doing business. In addition, the GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, and it confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could impede our ability to operate our business and our financial results. We cannot be certain that compliance programs will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely eliminated, particularly because the requirements and government interpretations of the requirements in this space are constantly evolving. Any action against us for violation of these laws, rules or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business, as well as damage our business or reputation. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly.\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are safer, more advanced or more effective than ours, which may harm our ability to successfully market or commercialize any product candidates we may develop and ultimately harm our financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our objective is to design, develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, safety, tolerability and convenience. In many cases, our product candidates that we commercialize will compete with existing, market-leading products. The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We may face competition with respect to any product candidates that we seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nBayer AG and Merck & Co., Inc. (\u201cBayer/Merck\u201d), have an active collaboration on sGC stimulators including ADEMPAS\u00ae (riociguat), which has been approved for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, (PAH) and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) and Verquvo\u00ae (vericiguat), which is approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such sGC products may compete directly with our own product candidates in our non-CNS target indications. Because Bayer/Merck already have experience conducting successful clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for an sGC product, they may be able to conduct clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates and target indications more quickly or efficiently than we can.\nFurthermore, we are aware of a number of other approved products and late-stage product candidates for the treatment of our target indications.\nMELAS. There are currently no approved treatments for MELAS or Mitochondrial Disease in the United States. We believe the following companies are engaged in clinical development of products for the treatment of MELAS or Mitochondrial Disease, which include patients with MELAS:\nPTC Therapeutics has a registrational Phase 2/3 study ongoing of vatiquinone, an antioxidant/NQO1 modulator, assessing the treatment of Mitochondrial Disease in participants with refractory epilepsy. Khondrion B.V has a Phase 2b study ongoing with sonlicromanol, a redox modulator, assessing the attention domain of cognitive function in MELAS-spectrum disorders. Abliva AB has a Phase 1a/b study ongoing of KL1333, an NAD+ modulator, in Primary Mitochondrial Disease. Abliva AB has announced plans to initiate a pivotal clinical Phase II/III study of KL1333 in MELAS-Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS)-Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) spectrum disorders during 2021. Reneo Pharma LTD ran a Phase 1 study of REN001, a PPAR\u03b4 agonist, in patients with Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy and has a planned Phase 2/3 study of REN001 in Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy. Astellas Pharma Inc has a planned Phase2/3 study of ASP0367, a PPAR\u03b4 modulator, in patients with Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy.\nADv. There are currently no approved products in the United States to treat ADv. There are six products approved in the United States to treat AD symptoms.\nAricept\u00ae (donepezil) is a cholinesterase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type, including in patients with mild, moderate and severe AD. Razadyne\u00ae (galantamine) and Exelon\u00ae (rivastigmine) are cholinesterase inhibitors indicated for treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type. Namenda\u00ae (memantine) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type. Namzaric\u00ae is a combination of donepezil and memantine indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type in patients stabilized on 10 mg of donepezil hydrochloride once daily. Biogen received FDA approval for aducanumab, an anti-amyloid beta (A\u03b2) mAb, for the treatment of AD.\nWe are not aware of any companies engaged in clinical development of products for the treatment of ADv. There are many companies developing treatments for AD, which could be our competitors. These include the following companies engaged in the late-stage clinical development of products for the treatment of AD:\nThere are multiple A\u03b2 targeting agents in Phase 3 studies for the treatment of AD, including Eli Lilly\u2019s solanezumab (anti-A\u03b2 mAb), Eisai/Biogen\u2019s BAN2401 (anti-A\u03b2 mAb), Roche\u2019s gantenerumab (anti-A\u03b2 mAb), Alzheon\u2019s ALZ-801 (A\u03b2 aggregation inhibitor) and AZTherapies\u2019ALZT-OP1 (A\u03b2 aggregation inhibitor). Compounds in Phase 3 studies with other mechanisms of action include TauRx\u2019s TRx0237/LMTX (Tau aggregation inhibitor), Shanghai Greenvalley Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\u2019s GV-971 (oligomannate), and AB Science\u2019s masitinib (c-Kit, Lyn, Fyn and CSF1R kinase inhibitor). Compounds in Phase 2/3 studies include AgeneBio\u2019s AGB-101 (SV2A inhibitor), Grifols IVIG (Immunoglobulin), Cortexyme\u2019s atuzaginstat (bacterial protease inhibitor), Anavex\u2019s ANAVEX 2-73 (Sigma-1, M2/M3 RA), and vTv Therapeutics\u2019 azeliragon/TTP-488 (RAGE antagonist). There are many other companies engaged in earlier stage clinical development for products targeting AD.\nCIAS. There are currently no approved products in the United States to treat CIAS. There many companies developing treatments for CIAS. These include the following companies engaged in the late-stage clinical development of products for the treatment of CIAS:\nBoehringer Ingelheim has three ongoing registrational Phase 3 studies of the glycine transporter type-1 inhibitor, BI 425809, assessing safety and efficacy for the treatment of CIAS. Biogen has an ongoing Phase 2 study of the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor positive allosteric modulator, BIIB104, assessing safety and efficacy in participants with CIAS. Neurocrine Biosciences has an ongoing Phase 2 study of the d-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, luvadaxistat, in participants with CIAS. atai Life Sciences has announced plans for a Phase 2 study of the cholinergic, glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid- B receptor modulator, RL-007, for the treatment of CIAS.\nIf our product candidates do not obtain regulatory approvals in our target indications prior to these or any other competing product candidates, or if our product candidates do not demonstrate superior efficacy, safety or tolerability compared to these and any other approved therapeutics for our target indications, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nMany of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA for indications our product candidates are targeting, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn addition, we could face litigation or other proceedings with respect to the scope, ownership, validity and/or enforceability of our patents relating to our competitors' products and our competitors may allege that our products infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property. The availability of our competitors' products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any products that we may develop and commercialize. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights.\u201d\nThe impact of healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may harm our business.\nOur revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products and services could harm our business, operations and financial condition. There is\nsignificant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act in 2010. It is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing health care legislation. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect: the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products; our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product; our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our product candidates outside the United States, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our product candidates outside the United States for which we may rely on partnerships with third parties. If we commercialize our product candidates outside the United States, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022our customers' ability to obtain reimbursement for our product candidates outside the United States;\n\u2022our ability to gain reimbursement in foreign markets at a price that is profitable;\n\u2022our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u2022the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u2022different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u2022import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u2022longer lead times for shipping;\n\u2022language barriers for technical training;\n\u2022reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u2022the existence of additional potentially relevant third-party intellectual property rights;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nForeign sales of our product candidates could also be harmed by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs.\nOur ability to generate meaningful revenues in jurisdictions outside of the United States may be limited due to the strict price controls and reimbursement limitations imposed by governments outside of the United States.\nIn some countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies, or to meet other criteria for pricing approval. If reimbursement of a product candidate, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, additional competitors could enter the market with generic versions of such drugs, which may result in a material decline in sales of affected products.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved, small-molecule innovator product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA that references the FDA's prior approval of the small-molecule innovator product. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. These include, subject to certain exceptions, the period during which an FDA-approved drug is subject to orphan drug exclusivity. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication, \"Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\" known as the \"Orange Book.\" If there are patents listed in the Orange Book, a generic or NDA applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents must include in the ANDA a \"Paragraph IV certification,\" challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents.\nAccordingly, if any of our product candidates are approved, competitors could file ANDAs for generic versions of our small-molecule drug products or NDAs that reference our small-molecule drug products, respectively. If there are patents listed for our small-molecule drug products in the Orange Book, those ANDAs and NDAs would be required to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating whether the ANDA applicant does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict which, if any, patents in our current portfolio or patents we may obtain in the future will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would address such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents, or the outcome of any such suit.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products and technologies we develop or license. Moreover, if any of our patents that are listed in the Orange Book are successfully challenged by way of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent litigation, the affected product could immediately face generic competition and its sales would likely decline rapidly and materially.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur prospects for success depend on our ability to retain our management team and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Peter M. Hecht, Ph.D., our Chief Financial Officer, Anjeza Gjino, our Chief Scientific Officer, Andreas Busch, Ph.D., and our Chief Operating Officer, Cheryl Gault. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors and an inability to find suitable replacements could result in delays in product development and harm our business. In particular, we continue our search for a new Chief Medical Officer, the absence of which for a continued period may have an adverse effect on our clinical and pre-clinical operations. Pursuant to their employment arrangements, each of our executive officers, and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time, with or without notice. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we may be able to offer. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific personnel from universities and research institutions. The failure to succeed in nonclinical or clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. In addition, in order to induce employees to continue their employment with us, we have provided equity awards that vest over time and the value to our employees of such equity awards may be significantly affected by\nmovements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may be at any time insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.\nWe may need to expand our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing growth of our employee base, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 32 full-time employees and we will continue to align our workforce with our business priorities throughout 2022. To the extent our operations grow, we may need to expand our full-time employee base and hire more consultants and contractors. Our management may then need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing this growth. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate revenues could be adversely affected and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of our products, if approved, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we become subject to product liability claims and cannot successfully defend ourselves against them, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in, among other things: withdrawal of subjects from our clinical studies; substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; decreased demand for our product candidates or any future product candidates following marketing approval, if obtained; damage to our reputation and exposure to adverse publicity; increased FDA warnings on product labels; litigation costs; distraction of management's attention from our primary business; loss of potential revenue; and the inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates, if approved.\nWe maintain product liability insurance coverage for our clinical studies through both domestic and international insurance policies, subject to an annual coverage limit. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer if a judgment or settlement exceeds available insurance proceeds. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses, including if insurance coverage becomes increasingly expensive. If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may not be able to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, particularly in light of the size of our business and financial resources. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if we are unsuccessful in defending such a claim or claims and the resulting judgments exceed our insurance coverage, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nDuring the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, if approved, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts of any approved product candidates. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe\nthat an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or The Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d For so long as we remain either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company, we will be exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires auditor attestation to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. We will cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total gross annual revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2024, the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the Separation; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are, however, subject to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we must include a management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As of the expiration of our emerging growth company status and smaller reporting company status, we will be broadly subject to enhanced reporting and other requirements under the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. There can be no assurances that in future periods we will be able to timely conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404(a).\nWe may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party CROs, CMOs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product candidates' development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party CROs, CMOs, business development partners and other contractors and consultants may be vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, ransomware, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. Insurance may not be adequate to fully cover costs to restore data and resume normal working operations, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including violating applicable regulatory standards and requirements or engaging in insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and applicable foreign regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and applicable foreign regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately and/or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, research and development, commercialization and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to considerable laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict, regulate or prohibit a wide range of activities pertaining to clinical trials including the informed consent process, data integrity and conducting the study in accordance with the investigational plan, and for approved products, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, possible exclusions from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. federal healthcare programs, contractual damages and reputational harm.\nIf we or any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe and any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and regulated\nmaterials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air and water; and employee health and safety. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. In some countries in which we operate, the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries are exposed to a high risk of corruption associated with the conduct of clinical trials and other interactions with healthcare professionals and institutions. Any such activities could expose us to potential liability under the FCPA, which may result in us incurring significant criminal and civil penalties and to potential liability under the anti-corruption laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, the costs we may incur in defending against an FCPA investigation could be significant.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nOur rights under the intellectual property license agreement with Ironwood could be challenged.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into an intellectual property license agreement with Ironwood, in connection with which Ironwood granted to us a license to use certain Ironwood know-how in connection with our research and development of sGC stimulator products. If we were to use such licensed know-how and if our rights under the intellectual property license agreement were challenged by a third party or we were otherwise prevented from exercising our rights as contemplated under the intellectual property license agreement, our research and development activities could be delayed until we were able to either resume exercising such rights or develop or acquire adequate alternative know-how.\nOur agreements with Ironwood may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations with unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements related to the Separation, including, among others, the separation agreement (which we refer to as the \"Separation Agreement\"), the employment matters agreement, the tax matters agreement, the intellectual property license agreement, and the development agreement (which we refer to as the \"Development Agreement\"), were negotiated in the context of the Separation while we were still controlled by Ironwood. Until the distribution occurred, Ironwood effectively had the sole and absolute discretion to determine and change the terms of the Separation, including the terms of any agreements between Ironwood and us and the establishment of the record date and distribution date. As a result, the provisions thereof may be unfavorable to us and may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock as a result.\nOur common stock has a limited trading history and the market price has fluctuated widely, and may in the future fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022a relatively low-volume trading market for our shares of common stock may result, which could cause trades of small blocks of shares to have a significant impact on the price of our shares of common stock;\n\u2022results and timing of nonclinical studies and clinical studies of our product candidates;\n\u2022the commercial performance of our products, if approved, as well as the costs associated with such activities;\n\u2022results of clinical studies of our competitors' products;\n\u2022failure to adequately protect our trade secrets;\n\u2022our inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u2022commencement or termination of any strategic partnership or licensing arrangement;\n\u2022regulatory developments with respect to our products or our competitors' products, including any developments, litigation or public concern about the safety of such products;\n\u2022announcements concerning product development results, including clinical trial results, the introduction of new products or intellectual property rights of us or others;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and our quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u2022deviations in our operating results from any guidance we may provide or the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other shareholders;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry and speculation regarding our company or our stock price in the financial or scientific press or in online investor communities;\n\u2022changes in market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector;\n\u2022Nasdaq's rules, which impose certain continued listing requirements, including a minimum $1 bid price, such that a failure to meet these requirements would lead Nasdaq to take steps to delist our common stock; and\n\u2022changes in general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nThe market price for our common stock is particularly volatile.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our stock price will continue to be more volatile than those of a seasoned issuer. Several factors cause the volatility in our share price. We are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our short operating history, lack of revenues and the uncertain success (including of regulatory approval) of any of our product candidates. As a consequence of this risk, more risk-averse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares of our\ncommon stock more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Plaintiffs have, in the past, initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of such litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to initiate or maintain coverage of our stock, publish a negative report or change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If securities or industry analysts fail to initiate coverage of our stock, the lack of exposure to the market could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If any of the analysts who cover us or may cover us in the future publish a negative report or change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us or may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our operations. In addition, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our articles of organization and bylaws and are subject to provisions of Massachusetts law that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current board of directors or to effect a change of control or other business combination involving our company.\nOur restated articles of organization and bylaws and certain provisions of Massachusetts law may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of our company that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. For example, our bylaws grant our directors the right to adjourn any meetings of shareholders. Our board of directors also may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Massachusetts state law also prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner. These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nOur articles of organization designate the state and federal courts located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the state and federal courts located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our shareholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, or the MBCA, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. In additional, our articles of organization provide that unless our board of directors consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the U.S. federal district courts shall be the exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the U.S. federal securities laws. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the\ncompany and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Massachusetts were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18427, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CYCN"}
