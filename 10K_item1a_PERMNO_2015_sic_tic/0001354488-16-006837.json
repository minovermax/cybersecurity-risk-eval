RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our independent auditors issued an explanatory paragraph in their audit report expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our net loss and negative cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and our levels of working capital as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Prior to our acquisition of Dolphin Films, its independent auditors also expressed doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern based upon its net loss for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, its accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and its level of working capital. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional sales of its common stock; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not have enough financial resources to support our business and operations and as a result may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may continue to incur operating losses.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our operating losses were $4,050,021. Our accumulated deficit was $42,628,155 at December 31, 2015. In addition, Dolphin Films, prior to its acquisition had a history of operating losses and may not have been able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Dolphin Films\u2019 net loss was $3,410,247 and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, its net losses were $7,106,032 and $8,094,900, respectively. Dolphin Films\u2019 accumulated deficit at September 30, 2015 was $18,611,179. Furthermore, Dolphin Films did not, and we do not, anticipate having an operating profit in 2016. Our ability to generate operating profit in the future will depend on our ability to successfully produce and commercialize multiple web series and motion pictures, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate an operating profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service requirements or our working capital requirements. As a result we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.\nWe may fail to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the recent Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated benefits and to combine the businesses of the Company and Dolphin Films in a manner that achieves synergy and a shared strategy but that does not materially disrupt the existing activities of the companies. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe have substantial indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and business operations.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of debt that we may be unable to extend, refinance or repay. If we are unable to refinance or extend our debt, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations. The following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total current liabilities of approximately $8.0 million relative to total stockholders\u2019 deficit of approximately $12.9 million. In addition, we acquired Dolphin Films which had a substantial amount of debt that has now become the Company\u2019s debt. As of September 30, 2015, Dolphin Films had total liabilities of $36.6 million. Our indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, future digital productions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;\n\u25cf we may have to pay higher interest rates upon obtaining future financing, thereby reducing our cash flows; and\n\u25cf we may need a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the success of our productions and other factors contained in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying digital or movie productions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all. As a consequence of our substantial indebtedness, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe may be exposed to litigation as a result of the recent Merger, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders and other third parties due to the combination of the Company and Dolphin Films businesses following the Merger. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operation or may cause disruptions to the combined company\u2019s operations.\nOur business requires a substantial investment of capital and failure to access sufficient capital while awaiting delayed revenues will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nThe production, acquisition and distribution of a digital production or a motion picture require a significant amount of capital. In 2014, for example, Dolphin Films capitalized production costs were $14,274,866. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our productions. We do not have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution on which to depend for our liquidity needs and a time lapse may require us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements through related party transactions with our CEO or other financing sources. There can be no assurance that any additional financing resources will be available to us as and when required, or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our inability to raise capital necessary to sustain our operations while awaiting delayed revenues would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have been in the past, and may be in the future, unable to recoup our investments in digital projects.\nSimilar to others in the entertainment industry, we purchase scripts and project ideas for which we have no current production plans and for which we have not identified a potential distributor. For example, in 2011 and 2012, we purchased scripts for several digital projects related to a particular financing structure. We were unable to identify a distributor or sufficient advertisers who were interested in the development and distribution of certain digital projects, which represented a total cost of $648,525. As a result, the costs incurred to purchase those scripts were written off in 2015, which negatively impacted our financial results. If, in the future, we are unable to generate interest in other scripts and project ideas which we have purchased, those scripts will also be written off, which will adversely affect our results of operations.\nDelays, cost overruns, cancellation or abandonment of the completion or release of our digital web series or motion pictures may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere are substantial financial risks relating to production, completion and release of digital web series or motion pictures. Actual film costs may exceed their budgets and factors such as labor disputes, unavailability of a star performer, equipment shortages, disputes with production teams or adverse weather conditions may cause cost overruns and delay or hamper film completion. We are typically responsible for paying all production costs in accordance with a budget and received a fixed producer\u2019s fee for our services plus a portion of any project income, however to the extent that delays, failure to complete projects or cost overruns result in us not completing the web series or motion picture within budget, there may not be enough funds left to pay us our producer\u2019s fee, to generate any project income or complete the project at all. If this were to occur, it would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to both timely and accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we identified several material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2015, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf Design deficiencies related to the entity level control environment, including risk assessment, information and communication and monitoring controls:\n\u25cf There is no documented fraud risk assessment or risk management oversight function.\n\u25cf\nThere are no documented procedures related to financial reporting matters (both internal and external) to the appropriate parties.\n\u25cf\nThere is no budget prepared and therefore monitoring controls are not designed effectively as current results cannot be compared to expectations.\n\u25cf\nThere is no documented process to monitor and remediate deficiencies in internal controls.\n\u25cf Inadequate documented review and approval of certain aspects of the accounting process including the documented review of accounting reconciliations and journal entries that they considered to be a material weakness in internal control. Specifically:\n\u25cf There is no documented period end closing procedures, specifically the individuals that are responsible for preparation, review and approval of period end close functions.\n\u25cf Reconciliations are performed on all balance sheet accounts, including noncontrolling interest on at least a quarterly basis; however there is no documented review and approval by a member of management that is segregated from the period end financial reporting process.\n\u25cf There is no review and approval for the posting of journal entries.\n\u25cf\nInadequate segregation of duties within the accounting process, including the following:\n\u25cf\nOne individual has the ability to add vendors to the master vendor file. This individual also has access to the Company checkbook that is maintained in a secured location.\n\u25cf\nOne individual has sole access to our information technology system to initiate, process and record financial information. We have not developed any internal controls related to information technology systems including change management, physical security, access or program development.\nWhile we have taken a number of remedial actions to address these material weaknesses, we cannot predict the outcome of our remediation efforts at this time. Each of the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, our stock price could be negatively impacted and we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC.\nWe rely on third party relationships with online digital platforms for our advertising revenue and we may be unable to secure such relationships.\nWe anticipate entering into distribution agreements containing revenue share provisions with online digital platforms to distribute our digital productions. Pursuant to these revenue share provisions, we will earn a portion of advertising revenues once our digital productions are distributed online. If we fail to secure such relationships with online digital platforms, we will not be able to earn advertising revenues from our digital projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, some of our distributors have moved from an advertisement-based model to a subscription-based model which makes it more difficult for us to use our funding and distribution methods.\nOur co-production activities may be unsuccessful.\nWe have entered into a co-production agreement with a production partner for an upcoming digital series. Pursuant to the agreement we will rely on our co-producer to raise 50% of the budget for the digital series and to help develop and produce the digital series. If our co-producer fails to fulfill its obligations under the co-production agreement, we may not be able to successfully complete production of the digital series which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDolphin Films relies on third party distributors to distribute its films and their failure to perform will negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.\nDolphin Films motion pictures are primarily distributed and marketed by third party distributors. If any of these third party distributors fails to perform under their respective arrangements with us and Dolphin Films, such failure could negatively impact the success of the motion pictures that Dolphin Films produces and have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and ability to generate revenues.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain advertisers, which could negatively impact our results of operation.\nTypically, online digital platforms are responsible for securing advertisers and, as such, our ability to earn advertising revenues would depend on their success in doing so. However, at times we have, and may continue to, proactively secure advertising commitments against anticipated web series. Our ability to retain advertisers is contingent on our ability to successfully complete and deliver online projects which are commercially successful, which we may fail to do. Advertising revenues could also be adversely impacted by factors outside our control such as failure of our digital productions to attract our target viewer audiences, lack of future demand for our digital productions, the inability of third party online digital platforms to deliver ads in an effective manner, competition for advertising revenue from existing competitors or new digital media companies, declines in advertising rates, adverse legal developments relating to online advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation. The existence of any of these factors could result in a decrease of our anticipated advertising revenues.\nOur kids clubs depend on sponsorship donations to generate revenue.\nWe generate revenues from our online kids clubs through a portion of the sale of memberships to various donors. Donors typically sponsor a school for $10,000 which entitles each child in the school to receive an annual online kids club membership and entitles the school to receive a Reading Oasis. Receipt of sponsorship donations are unpredictable and depend on a number of factors such as our ability to successfully brand, market and implement the online kids clubs as well as local and international business and economic conditions.\nOur CEO beneficially owns approximately 52.5% of our outstanding share capital and has super voting rights with respect to the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock which he currently holds, and his interests may be different from yours.\nAs of March 31, 2016, our CEO, Mr. O\u2019Dowd beneficially owned approximately 52.5% of our outstanding share capital. Consequently, Mr. O\u2019Dowd has substantial influence over our business, including election of directors, declaration of dividends and decisions regarding whether or not to issue stock and for what consideration, whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our assets and for what consideration and other significant corporate actions. It is possible that Mr. O\u2019Dowd may act in a manner that advances his best interests but may not be aligned with your interests or the best interests of the Company.\nIn addition, as a holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, Mr. O\u2019Dowd also has super voting rights of three votes per preferred share. Holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and are entitled to vote together as a single class on all matters upon which Common Stock holders are entitled to vote. Your voting rights will be diluted as a result of these super voting rights. In addition, anti-dilution protections, described below, may result in an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock into which Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd and certain eligible persons can be converted, which could further dilute your percentage of voting rights.\nRisks Related to the Industry\nWe have and may in the future be adversely affected by union activity.\nWe retain the services of actors who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (\u201cSAG-AFTRA\u201d) and we may also become signatories to certain guilds such as Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. Collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. In addition, our digital projects fall within SAG-AFTRA\u2019s definition of \u201cnew media\u201d, which is an emerging category covered by its New Media and Interactive Media Agreements for actors. As such, our ability to retain actors is subject to uncertainties that arise from SAG-AFTRA\u2019s administration of this relatively new category of collective bargaining agreements. Such uncertainties have resulted and may continue to result in delays in production of our digital projects.\nIn addition, if negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the union could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in production of our digital projects. We could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Depending on their duration, union activity or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital productions and motion pictures are subject to numerous factors, over which we may have limited or no control.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital productions and motion pictures depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the key talent involved, the timing of release, the promotion and marketing of the digital production or motion picture, the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions, the genre and specific subject matter of the digital production or motion picture, its critical acclaim and the breadth, timing and format of its initial release. We cannot predict the impact of such factors on any digital production or motion picture, and many are factors that are beyond our control. As a result of these factors and many others, our digital productions and motion pictures may not be as successful as we anticipate, and as a result, our results of operations may suffer.\nWe may be unable to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment that meets the changing preferences of our consumers.\nChanging consumer tastes affect our ability to predict which digital productions will be popular with web audiences. As we invest in various digital projects, stars and directors, it is highly likely that at least some of the digital projects in which we invest will not appeal to our target audiences. If we are unable to produce web content that appeals to our target audiences the costs of such digital productions could exceed revenues generated and anticipated profits may not be realized. Our failure to realize anticipated profits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe creation of content for the entertainment industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with companies with much greater resources than we have.\nThe business in which we engage is highly competitive. Our primary business operations are subject to competition from companies which, in many instances, have greater development, production, and distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the services of writers, producers, directors, actors and other artists to produce our digital content. Larger companies have a broader and more diverse selection of scripts than we do, which translates to a greater probability that they will be able to more closely fit the demands and interests of advertisers than we can.\nIn addition, our acquired business Dolphin Films is a very small and unproven entity as compared to our competitors. As an independent producer, we through Dolphin Films, will compete with major U.S. and international studios. Most of the major U.S. studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations that can provide both the means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that may allow them better to offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their motion picture and other operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties, as well as for actors, directors and other personnel required for production. Such competition for the industry\u2019s talent and resources may negatively affect our ability to acquire and produce product.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims or liability claims for media or motion picture content against us which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses.\nThere is a possibility that others may claim that our productions and production techniques, or those of Dolphin Films, misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed digital web series, stories, characters, other entertainment or intellectual property. In addition, as distributors of media and motion picture content, we may face potential liability for such claims as defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. If successfully asserted, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property, including that of Dolphin Films. We attempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and distribution arrangements with companies for limited durations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.\nIn addition to our company websites and applications, we use third-party applications, websites, and social media platforms to promote our projects and engage consumers, as well as monitor and collect certain information about users of our online forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet such as the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (\u201cCOPPA\u201d). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what website operators can present to children under the age of 13 and what information can be collected from them. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual\u2019s personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws governing individual privacy, including safeguards which relate to the interaction with children. If our online activities were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations, we could be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\nThe Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has anti-dilution protections that may adversely affect our shareholders.\nFor a period of five years from the date of issuance, the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (issued as consideration for the Merger) will be subject to certain anti-dilution protections. Upon triggers specified in its Certificate of Designation, the number of shares of Common Stock into which Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mr. O'Dowd (or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. O'Dowd) (including Mr. O\u2019Dowd) can be converted will be increased, such that the total number of shares of Common Stock held by Mr. O'Dowd (or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. O'Dowd) (based on the number of shares of Common Stock held as of the date of issuance) will be preserved at the same percentage of shares of Common Stock outstanding currently held by such persons, which currently is approximately 52.5% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding. As a result, your ownership interests may be further diluted.\nPast and future equity issuances could result in dilution of your investment and a decline in our stock price.\nWe recently issued 2,300,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 1,000,000 Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, each convertible into shares of Common Stock upon exercise of their respective conversion rights, as consideration in the Merger, in addition to granting to Eligible Series C Preferred Stock Holders certain anti-dilution protections. In addition, we recently issued an aggregate of approximately 36.5 million shares of Common Stock to certain holders of promissory notes, including our CEO, in full repayment of the amounts of principal and interest outstanding under such promissory notes. As a result of these stock issuances, your ownership interest in the Company will be diluted, meaning you would own a smaller percentage of the Company.\nIn the near term, we may also need to raise additional capital and may seek to do so by conducting one or more private placements of equity securities, selling additional securities in a registered public offering, or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives. Such issuance of additional securities would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may cause our stock price to decline.\nAs an issuer of \u201cpenny stock,\u201d the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements does not apply to us and as a result we could be subject to legal action which may be costly.\nAlthough federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, for as long as we are a penny stock, we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading.\nOur common stock is quoted only on the OTC Market Pink Sheets, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Market Pink Sheets. The OTC Market Pink Sheets is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Market may result in an illiquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our Common Stock and depress the trading price of our Common Stock, and may have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.", "PERMNO": 17140, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "DLPN"}
