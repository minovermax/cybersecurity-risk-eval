RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties, together with other information set forth in this Form 10-K, should be carefully considered by current and future investors in our securities. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties presently unknown to us or currently deemed immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition, and the results of our operations, which in turn could negatively impact the value of our securities.\nOil, gas, and NGL prices fluctuate due to a number of uncontrollable factors, creating a component of uncertainty in our development plans and overall operations. Declines in prices adversely affect our financial results and rate of growth in proved reserves and production.\nOil and gas markets are volatile. We cannot predict future prices. The prices we receive for our production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital, and future rate of growth. The prices we receive depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in domestic and global supply and demand for oil and gas, the level of domestic and global oil and gas exploration and production activity, geopolitical instability, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, weather conditions, technological advances affecting energy consumption, governmental regulations and taxes, and the price and technological advancement of alternative fuels.\nOur proved oil and gas reserves and production volumes will decrease unless those reserves are replaced with new discoveries or acquisitions. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we expect to make substantial capital investments for the exploration and development of new oil and gas reserves. Historically, we have paid for these types of capital expenditures with cash flow provided by our production operations, our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of senior notes. Low prices reduce our cash flow and the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and may cause us to curtail, delay, or defer certain exploration and development projects. Moreover, low prices also may impact our abilities to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund acquisitions.\nIf prices stay at recent lower levels or decrease, we will be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties and/or our goodwill.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and goodwill for possible impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the calculated value of the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of our oil and gas properties subject to a ceiling test and no impairment was necessary. However, a decline of 8% or more in the value of the ceiling limitation would have resulted in an impairment. If commodity prices stay at the current early 2015 levels or decline further, we will incur full cost ceiling impairments in future quarters. Because the ceiling calculation uses rolling 12-month average commodity prices, the effect of lower quarter-over-quarter prices in 2015 compared to 2014 is a lower ceiling value each quarter. This will result in ongoing impairments each quarter until prices stabilize or improve. Impairment charges would not affect cash flow from operating activities, but would adversely affect our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nU.S. or global financial markets may impact our business and financial condition.\nA credit crisis or other turmoil in the U.S. or global financial system may have a negative impact on our business and our financial condition. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing. This could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions could have a negative impact on our lenders, the purchasers of our oil and gas production and the working interest owners in properties we operate, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.\nFailure to economically replace oil and gas reserves could negatively affect our financial results and future rate of growth.\nIn order to replace the reserves depleted by production and to maintain or increase our total proved reserves and overall production levels, we must either locate and develop new oil and gas reserves or acquire producing properties from others. This requires significant capital expenditures and can impose reinvestment risk for us, as we may not be able to continue to replace our reserves economically. While we occasionally may seek to acquire proved reserves, our main business strategy is to grow through exploration and drilling. Without successful exploration and development, our reserves, production and revenues could decline rapidly, which would negatively impact the results of our operations.\nExploration and development involves numerous risks, including new governmental regulations and the risk that we will not discover any commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Additionally, it can be unprofitable, not only from drilling dry holes, but also from drilling productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient reserves or declines in commodity prices.\nOur drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled for many reasons. Factors such as unforeseen poor drilling conditions, title problems, unexpected pressure irregularities, equipment failures, accidents, adverse weather conditions, compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, bans, moratoria or other restrictions implemented by local governments and the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling and completion services could negatively impact our drilling operations.\nOur proved reserve estimates may be inaccurate and future net cash flows are uncertain.\nEstimates of total proved oil and gas reserves (consisting of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves) and associated future net cash flow depend on a number of variables and assumptions. See \u201cForward-Looking Statement\u201d in this report. Among others, changes in any of the following factors may cause actual results to vary considerably from our estimates:\n\u00b7\ntiming of development expenditures;\n\u00b7\namount of required capital expenditures and associated economics;\n\u00b7\nrecovery efficiencies, decline rates, drainage areas, and reservoir limits;\n\u00b7\nanticipated reservoir and production characteristics and interpretations of geologic and geophysical data;\n\u00b7\nproduction rates, reservoir pressure, unexpected water encroachment, and other subsurface conditions;\n\u00b7\noil, gas, and NGL prices;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u00b7\naccess to assets restricted by local government action;\n\u00b7\noperating costs;\n\u00b7\nproperty, severance, excise and other taxes incidental to oil and gas operations;\n\u00b7\nworkover and remediation costs; and\n\u00b7\nfederal and state income taxes.\nAt December 31, 2014, 23% of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped.\nOur proved oil and gas reserve estimates are prepared by Cimarex engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers, reviewed our reserve estimates for properties that comprised at least 80% of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes, using a 10% discount rate, as of December 31, 2014.\nThe cash flow amounts referred to in this filing should not be construed as the current market value of our proved reserves. In accordance with SEC guidelines, the estimated discounted net cash flow from proved reserves is based on the average of the previous 12 months' first-day-of-the-month prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially different.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks.\nTo limit our exposure to price risk, we enter into hedging agreements from time to time, and use commodity derivatives. During 2014, we had hedges covering 28% of our oil production and 32% of our gas production. We currently do not have any hedges in place for 2015 or later periods. Hedges limit volatility and increase the predictability of a portion of our cash flow. These transactions also limit our potential gains when oil and gas prices exceed the prices established by the hedges.\nIn certain circumstances, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss, including instances in which:\n\u00b7\nthe counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform;\n\u00b7\nthere is a sudden unexpected event that materially increases oil and natural gas prices; or\n\u00b7\nthere is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement.\nBecause we account for derivative contracts under mark-to-market accounting, during periods we have hedging transactions in place we expect continued volatility in derivative gains or losses on our income statement as changes occur in the relevant price indexes.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, representing an extensive overhaul of the framework for regulation of U.S. financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act called for various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to establish regulations for implementation of many of its provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant derivatives regulations, including requirements that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and that cash collateral (margin) be posted for such transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for an exemption from the clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users, such as Cimarex, and it includes a number of defined terms used in determining how this exemption applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.\nWe have satisfied the requirements for the end-user exception to the clearing requirement and intend to continue to engage in derivative transactions. However, the CFTC is still finalizing rules that will have an impact on our hedging counterparties and possibly end-users as well. The ultimate effect of these new rules and any additional regulations is currently uncertain. New rules and regulations in this area may result in significant increased costs and disclosure obligations as well as decreased liquidity as entities that previously served as hedge counterparties exit the market.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging resource plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain. The value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and we may incur impairment charges if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nNew or emerging oil and gas resource plays have limited or no production history. Consequently, in those areas it is difficult to predict our future drilling costs and results. Therefore, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected. Similarly, our production may be lower than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline if our results are unsuccessful. As a result, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays.\nFurthermore, unless production is established during the primary term of certain of our undeveloped oil and gas leases, the leases will expire, and we will lose our right to develop those properties.\nOur business depends on oil and gas pipeline and transportation facilities, some of which are owned by others.\nIn addition to the existence of adequate markets, our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the proximity and capacity of pipeline systems, as well as storage, transportation, processing and fractionation facilities, most of which are owned by third parties. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. This is more likely in remote areas without established infrastructure, such as our Culberson County, Texas area where we have significant development activities. The lack of availability or capacity in these facilities or the loss of the these facilities due to weather, fire or other reasons, for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues.\nA limited number of companies purchase a majority of our oil, NGLs and natural gas. The loss of a significant purchaser could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell production.\nFederal and state regulation of oil and natural gas, local government activity, adverse court rulings, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas.\nCompetition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater financial and technological resources.\nWe operate in the competitive area of oil and gas exploration and production. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have larger operating staffs and greater capital resources. These competitors may be willing to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and gas properties. They may also be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.\nBecause our activity is also concentrated in areas of heavy industry competition, there is heightened demand for personnel, equipment, power, services, facilities and resources, resulting in higher costs than in other areas. Such intense competition also could result in delays in securing, or the inability to secure, the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources or facilities necessary for our development activities, which could negatively impact our production volumes. We also face higher costs in remote areas where vendors can charge higher rates due to that remoteness along with the inability to attract employees to those areas and the ability to deploy their resources in easier to access areas.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nInformation system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunction or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar acts. Such system failures could result in the unanticipated disruption of our operations, the processing of transactions, the failure to meet regulatory standards and the reporting of our financial results. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, production, and the sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including those implemented to protect the environment, human health and safety and wildlife. Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies frequently require permitting and impose conditions on our activities. During the permitting process, these regulatory agencies often exercise considerable discretion in both the timing and scope of the permits, and the public, including special interest groups, often has an opportunity to influence the timing and outcome of the process. The requirements or conditions imposed by these agencies can be costly and can delay the commencement of our operations.\nFailing to comply with any of the applicable laws and regulations could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal liabilities and penalties. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on both our financial condition and operations.\nEnvironmental matters and costs can be significant.\nAs an owner, lessee, or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various complex, stringent and constantly evolving environmental laws and regulations. Our operations inherently create the risk of environmental liability to the government and private parties stemming from our use, generation, handling and disposal of water and waste materials, as well as the release of hydrocarbons or other substances into the air, soil, or water. The environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including: the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated activities associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas; the restriction of types, quantities, and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nLiabilities under certain environmental laws can be joint and several and may in some cases be imposed regardless of fault on our part such as where we own a working interest in a property operated by another party. We also could be held liable for damages or remediating lands or facilities previously owned or operated by others regardless of whether such contamination resulted from our own actions and regardless if we were in compliance with all applicable law at the time. Further, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Since these environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and can result in substantial costs, such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on both our financial condition and operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we incur costs and liabilities due to a failure to comply with environmental regulations or a release of hazardous substances into the environment.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, pollutants, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, discharge, transportation and disposal of pollutants and solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas\nwhere hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The most significant of these environmental laws is as follows:\n\u00b7\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws, which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;\n\u00b7\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States;\n\u00b7\nThe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, and comparable state statutes, which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste;\n\u00b7\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), which governs the discharge of pollutants, including natural gas wastes into federal and state waters;\n\u00b7\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells; and\n\u00b7\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) which governs the emission of pollutants into the air,\nWe believe we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA, CWA, SDWA, CAA and related state and local laws and regulations. We also believe we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nFederal regulatory initiatives relating to the protection of threatened or endangered species could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nThe Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species' habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We conduct operations on federal oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species are currently listed as threatened or endangered, or could be listed as such, under the ESA. Operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist may require us to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may restrict or preclude our drilling activities in those areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. On March 27, 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken, whose habitat is over a five-state region, including Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, where we conduct operations, as a threatened species under the ESA. Listing of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species imposes restrictions on disturbances to critical habitat by landowners and drilling companies that would harass, harm or otherwise result in a \"taking\" of this species. However, the FWS also announced a final rule that will limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from the listing if those landowners and businesses have entered into certain range-wide conservation planning agreements, such as those developed by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), pursuant to which such parties agreed to take steps to protect the lesser prairie chicken's habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if its actions harm the lesser prairie chicken's habitat. We entered into a voluntary Candidate Conservation Agreement (CCA) with the WAFWA, whereby we agreed to take certain actions and limit certain activities, such as limiting drilling on certain portions of our\nacreage during nesting seasons, in an effort to protect the lesser prairie chicken. Such CCA could result in increased costs to us from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on drilling activities, which costs, delays or limitations may be significant. We could encounter similar issues if the greater sage grouse is listed as a threatened or endangered species because its habitat includes our areas of operation. A listing decision is anticipated in 2015.\nWe use some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risk and uncertainty in their application.\nOur horizontal drilling operations utilize some of the latest drilling and completion techniques. The risks or such techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nlanding the wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u00b7\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u00b7\nrunning casing the entire length of the wellbore;\n\u00b7\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\n\u00b7\nthe ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur hydraulic fracturing activities are subject to risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nWe use hydraulic fracturing for the completion of almost all of our wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping fluid and proppant at high pressure into a hydrocarbon bearing formation to create and hold open fractures. Those fractures enable gas or oil to move through the formation's pores to the well bore. Typically, the fluid used in this process is primarily water. In plays where hydraulic fracturing is necessary for successful development, the demand for water may exceed the supply. A lack of readily available water or a significant increase in the cost of water could cause delays or increased completion costs.\nWhile hydraulic fracturing historically has been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation from federal agencies. For example, in October 2011, the EPA announced its plan to propose federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater generated during the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use of a significant volume of water with some resulting \"flowback water,\" as well as \"produced water.\" If adopted, the new pretreatment rules will require shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities. Moreover, the EPA has indicated that it may develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; however, to date, it has taken no action to do so. In addition to the use of water, hydraulic fracturing fluid contains chemicals or additives designed to optimize production. Many states already require companies to disclose the components of this fluid, and additional states and municipalities, as well as the federal government, may follow with additional regulations regarding disclosure and other issues concerning hydraulic fracturing. Indeed, in May 2013, the BLM published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands that replaces a prior draft of proposed rulemaking issued by the agency in May 2012. The revised proposed rule would continue to require public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, confirmation that wells used in fracturing operations meet appropriate construction standards, and development of appropriate plans for managing flowback water that returns to the\nsurface. A final rule is expected to be published in 2015. In May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Many additional regulations also are being considered by federal, state and municipal governments and agencies, including limiting water withdrawals and usage, water disposal, restricting which additives may be used, implementing local or state-wide hydraulic fracturing moratoriums and temporary or permanent bans in certain environmentally sensitive and other areas. Public sentiment against hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production has become more vocal, which could lead to permitting and compliance requirements becoming more stringent. Consequences of these actions could increase our capital, compliance, and operating costs significantly, as well as delay or halt our ability to develop our oil and gas reserves.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nStudies have suggested that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be impacting the earth's climate. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, also present in natural gas as a secondary product, sometimes considered an impurity or a by-product of the burning of oil and natural gas, are examples of GHGs. The U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating, and in some cases implementing, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of GHGs. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD and/or Title V permits under EPA\u2019s GHG Tailoring Rule for their GHG emissions also may be required to meet \"Best Available Control Technology\" standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis, which includes certain of our operations. In recent proposed rulemaking EPA is widening the scope of annual GHG reporting to include not only activities associated with completion and workover of gas wells with hydraulic fracturing and activities associated with oil and natural gas production operations, but also completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing, gathering and boosting systems, and transmission pipelines.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In January 2015, President Obama announced a series of administration actions to reduce methane emissions, including rulemaking by the EPA and the BLM as well as updating of standards by the Department of Transportation\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration. The current administration intends to promulgate proposed climate change rulemaking this summer aimed at reducing GHG emissions by 45% by 2025 compared to 2012 levels. The current administration intends to finalize proposed climate change rulemaking by 2016. It is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business. Any such future laws and regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to develop and implement best management practices aimed at reducing GHG emissions, install and maintain emissions control technologies, as well as monitor and report on GHG emissions associated with our operations, and such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nOur limited ability to influence operations and associated costs on non-operated properties could result in economic losses that are partially beyond our control.\nOther companies operate approximately 23% of our net production. Our success in properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control. These factors include timing and amount of capital expenditures, the operator's expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants in drilling wells, selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities.\nOur business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for oil and gas, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, formations with abnormal pressures, casing collapses, uncontrollable flows of underground gas, blowouts, surface cratering, pipeline ruptures or cement failures. Other such risks include theft, vandalism, environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills and discharges of toxic gases. Any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\ndamage to, loss of or destruction of, property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damages;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations, civil litigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\ncosts related to repair and remediation.\nIn addition, our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. We do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations.\nAt December 31, 2014, our long-term debt consisted of $750 million of 4.375% senior notes due in 2024 and $750 million of 5.875% senior notes due in 2022. In addition to interest expense and principal on our long-term debt, we have demands on our cash resources including, among others, operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nOur ability to pay the principal and interest on our long-term debt and to satisfy our other liabilities will depend upon future performance and our ability to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by economic and capital market conditions, results of operations and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations also may be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates, as borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations. Without sufficient cash flow, there may not be adequate future sources of capital to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operating costs, we will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:\n\u00b7\nreducing or delaying capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nseeking additional debt financing or equity capital;\n\u00b7\nselling assets; or\n\u00b7\nrestructuring or refinancing debt.\nWe may be unable to complete any such strategies on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nThe indenture governing our senior notes and our credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that may limit management's discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements limit Cimarex's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;\n\u00b7\nmake loans to others;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u00b7\ncreate certain liens;\n\u00b7\nsell assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nenter into hedging contracts;\n\u00b7\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nIn addition, our revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not more than 3.5 and a current ratio (defined to include undrawn borrowings) of greater than 1.0. Also, the indenture, under which we issued our senior unsecured notes, restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, unless our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) is at least 2.25. The\nadditional indebtedness limitation does not prohibit us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the indenture governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our credit facility or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors, if the agreements so provide, to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make available further funds.\nOur acquisition activities may not be successful, which may hinder our replacement of reserves and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u00b7\ngeological risks and recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nfuture oil and gas prices and their appropriate market differentials;\n\u00b7\noperating costs; and\n\u00b7\npotential environmental risks and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections will not likely be performed on every well or facility, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Furthermore, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the identified problems.\nWe may lose leases if production is not established within the time periods specified in the leases.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. If we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves. The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 6.7% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2014. At that date, we had leases representing 56,278 net acres expiring in 2015, 263,486 net acres expiring in 2016, and 79,551 net acres expiring in 2017. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur disposition activities may be subject to factors beyond our control, and in certain cases we may retain unforeseen liabilities for certain matters.\nWe regularly sell non-core assets in order to increase capital resources available for other core assets and to create organizational and operational efficiencies. We also occasionally sell interests in core assets for the purpose of accelerating the development and increasing efficiencies in such core assets. Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets, including the approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the assets with terms we deem acceptable.\nSellers often retain certain liabilities or agree to indemnify buyers for certain matters related to the sold assets. The magnitude of any such retained liability or of the indemnification obligation is difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately could be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the company from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, the company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nCompetition for experienced, technical personnel may negatively impact our operations.\nOur exploratory and development drilling success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional personnel. The loss of any key executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. As we continue to grow our asset base and the scope of our operations, our future profitability will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly individuals with a strong background in geology, geophysics, engineering and operations.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nIn the normal course of business, we have various lawsuits and related disputed claims, including but not limited to claims concerning title, royalty payments, environmental issues, personal injuries, and contractual issues. Although we currently believe the resolution of these lawsuits and claims, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, our assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact that are not in accord with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such proceedings. Therefore, there can be no assurance that outcomes of future legal proceedings would not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, as a result of future legislation.\nVarious proposals have been made recommending the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Legislation is often introduced in Congress which would implement many of these proposals. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear, however, whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon such changes could be effective.\nThe passage of this legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could have an adverse effect on our financial position.\nThe refining industry may be unable to absorb rising U.S. oil and condensate production; in such a case, the resulting surplus could depress prices and restrict the availability of markets.\nThe export of oil and certain condensates is restricted under U.S. law. Absent a change in this law or an expansion of U.S. refining capacity, rising U.S. production of oil and condensate could result in a surplus of these products, which could cause prices for these commodities to fall and markets to constrict. If this occurs, our returns on our capital projects would decline, which could make some of our drilling plans uneconomic and which could require us to shut in some of our production. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability.", "PERMNO": 89509, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "XEC"}
