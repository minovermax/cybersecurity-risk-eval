{"cik": "66740", "company": "3M CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises\n* The Company\u2019s results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade and other external conditions.\nThe Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.\n* The Company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19).\n3M, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3M\u2019s operations. In these challenging and dynamic circumstances, 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M\u2019s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. Even with 3M\u2019s accelerated production at its global facilities combined with capacity from other manufacturers, the industry-wide challenge is that global demand for N95 and other respirators continues to exceed the industries\u2019 ability to deliver. Within individual regions and countries around the world, 3M is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. 3M\u2019s manufacturing, supply chain and distribution protocols have, for example, been impacted by the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act. In addition, trade barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3M going into the most needed areas. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Some of these COVID-related factors have increased demand for certain 3M products, while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. 3M has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its N95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3M against those who seek to exploit 3M\u2019s brand and reputation and defraud others. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. As economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the Company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. As part of the return to work process at the Company, the Company could face additional privacy and data security risks related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to COVID-19 testing, temperature checks, and contact tracing. Due to the speed and scope with which the COVID situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\nBecause the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company\u2019s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n* The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as \u201cPFAS.\u201d The PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise.\n* The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, the Sunshine Act, or other matters. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company\u2019s suppliers, vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M\u2019s Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements or with legal requirements.\nThe outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the Company may negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences\n* The Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company\u2019s incentive programs, or the customer\u2019s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products; and (v) changes in the\nbusiness environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.\n* The Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\nThis ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n* The Company\u2019s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, natural disasters and other disruptive factors.\nThe Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters and other disruptive events, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Company\u2019s receipt of adequate supplies or disruption to key manufacturing sites\u2019 operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and third-party service providers, security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nation-state actors, computer viruses, hardware, software, and system vulnerabilities, ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The Company\u2019s increased adoption of remote working, which was driven by the pandemic, may also introduce additional threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. Any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, interference with the Company\u2019s operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results.\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. The Company\nrealigned from five to four business segments, effective in April of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. Successful execution of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important to the Company\u2019s future results.\n* The Company\u2019s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important, which, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M\u2019s brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\n* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n* Change in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings are important to 3M\u2019s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company\u2019s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor\u2019s. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have served to lower 3M\u2019s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company\u2019s capital structure could impact 3M\u2019s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n* Changes in tax rates, laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related factors stated above, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.", "PERMNO": 22592, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "MMM"}
