{"cik": "1035201", "company": "CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GROUP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.\nCalifornia Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.\nOur revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.\nWe periodically file rate increase applications with the commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, liabilities, and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases. If a commission determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.\nIf our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nRegulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.\nIf we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets. If the commission disagrees with our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties. Furthermore, there is a risk that the commission could determine that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the ratepayers rather than our stockholders.\nChanges in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business.\nRegulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the CPUC allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the CPUC reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The original decision by the commission to change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy, affected our business.\nWe rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future.\nOur water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned.\nEnvironmental laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.\nWe are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.\nNew and more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs.\nOn July 1, 2014, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) changed the water quality standard for chromium-6 in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 10 parts per billion or less of chromium-6 in our California water supply. We have two districts where every well does not comply with the new standard. The new standard is expected to restrict water supply significantly increase capital spending and operation expenses in the impacted districts. The commission authorized a memorandum account in 2014 to track all costs associated with compliance with the new chromium-6 standard. Although we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.\nLegislation regarding climate change may impact our operations.\nFuture legislation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California rate payers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.\nThe Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program, which went into effect January 1, 2011, requires diesel engines to use low carbon fuel such as biodiesel or other alternatives. This may increase the operating cost of our generators and vehicles.\nWe maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers, including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that we retrofitted prior to the end of 2010 to meet California emission standards. If future legislation further impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it will increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.\nStarting January 1, 2010, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) will require mitigation of green house gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our rate payers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.\nCap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.\nWe are party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our paying damages not covered by insurance.\nWe have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding California Public Utilities Commission's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWastewater operations entail significant risks.\nWhile wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDemand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.\nDemand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.\nIn addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions for our non-California operations may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during the drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.\nFinally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.\nThe adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings.\nWe depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 the amount of rainfall;\n\u2022 the amount of water stored in reservoirs;\n\u2022 underground water supply from which well water is pumped;\n\u2022 availability from water wholesalers;\n\u2022 changes in the amount of water used by our customers;\n\u2022 water quality;\n\u2022 legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;\n\u2022 changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and\n\u2022 population growth.\nWe purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results.\nThere is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon emissions is changing the chemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and the earth's overall climate. Because scientific efforts have been global in nature, and because climate modeling has not yet been predictive on a local scale, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have in our service areas. In addition, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred in the historical record in California but prior to our operation. Thus, we include potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.\nWe have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.\nFrom time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.\nThe parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.\nIf we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:\n\u2022 adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;\n\u2022 adversely affect operating costs;\n\u2022 increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and\n\u2022 increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.\nWe may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may also be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.\nChanges in water supply costs impact our operations.\nThe cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 34.5% and 35.9% of our total operating costs in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs with variances, netted against variance in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and up to 36 month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.\nDependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations.\nPurchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.\nPurchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2014 and 2013, purchased power expense represented 6.4% and 6.3% of our total operating costs, respectively. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the commission authorizes a rate change but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA and therefore variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.\nOur ability to generate new operating contracts or renewal of existing operating contracts is affected by local politics.\nOur revenue and non-regulated revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as well as renew operating contracts with cities, other agencies and municipal utility districts. As our services are sold in a political environment, there is exposure to changing trends and municipal preferences. Terrorist acts have affected some political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of water or wastewater utility services. Municipalities own and municipal employees operate the majority of water and wastewater systems. Significant marketing and sales efforts are spent demonstrating the benefits of contract operations to elected officials and municipal authorities. The existing political environment means decisions affecting our business are based on many factors, not just economic factors.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to add or replace property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.\nOur ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.\nWhile the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.\nWe are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.\nMany of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.\nWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.\nAs a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 94% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.\nOur subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.\nWe may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.\nAcquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:\n\u2022 problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies or products with our existing businesses and products;\n\u2022 liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;\n\u2022 diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;\n\u2022 failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022 difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and\n\u2022 difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.\nWe may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.\nWe may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must effectively:\n\u2022 hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;\n\u2022 retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;\n\u2022 implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;\n\u2022 expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and\n\u2022 manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nOur billed revenues will decrease, and such decrease may be material, if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $136.4 million, or 22.8%, of our 2014 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. If any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.\nOur ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by state commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors, which may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by state commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nOur non-regulated activities operate in a competitive market.\nWhile a majority of our business is regulated, our non-regulated activities participates in a competitive market. We compete with several larger companies whose size, financial resources, customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance contracts. Due to the nature of our contract operations business, and to the very competitive nature of the market, we must accurately estimate the cost and profitability of each project while, at the same time, maintaining prices at a level low enough to compete with other companies. Our inability to achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of operations.\nDemand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.\nWe believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future because of the volatility of the stock market and a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include: regulatory developments; general economic\nconditions and trends; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts; actual or anticipated developments in our competitors' businesses or the competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us or our industry; and major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of our stock.\nEquity markets in general can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Such price and volume fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.\nAdverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.\nA substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.\nAt December 31, 2014, 708 of our 1,105 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.\nWe believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for healthcare and pensions, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.\nWe depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.\nOur operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.\nAlthough we own facilities in a number of states, over 94% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, utility cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.\nWe are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California relative to other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.\nThe effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The California Public Utilities Commission has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.\nOur water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.\nWe operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.\nIn light of the threats to the nation's health and security ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.\nWe depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.\nWe retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.\nWe evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.\nWe rely on our information technology (\"IT\") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Although we do not believe that our IT systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations, our IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022 power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;\n\u2022 operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u2022 physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;\n\u2022 computer viruses;\n\u2022 intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and\n\u2022 Earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters.\nThese events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.\nThe accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:\n\u2022 the useful life of intangible rights;\n\u2022 the number of years to depreciate certain assets;\n\u2022 amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;\n\u2022 our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;\n\u2022 future costs and assumptions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits;\n\u2022 regulatory recovery of deferred items;\n\u2022 possible tax uncertainties; and\n\u2022 projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.\nThe quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with contractual agreements, misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material or could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability to raise future capital.\nFurther, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market's confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition, non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which would further reduce our stock price.\nWe may be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or other accounting or financial reporting standards, the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be required to adopt IFRS or other accounting or financial reporting standards different from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which is currently applicable to our accounting and financial reporting. In 2008 the SEC released a proposed roadmap for the adoption of IFRS. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board are currently working together to replace current GAAP with a convergence of GAAP and IFRS accounting standards. Under GAAP we are subject to the accounting procedures for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, which, among other things, allows us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases. Currently, IFRS does not contain provisions equivalent to the current GAAP accounting procedures. In 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 14 which basically allows for an adopter of IFRS to continue using regulatory accounting standards from its prior GAAP while the IASB works out its own regulatory accounting standard. The implementation and adoption of new accounting or financial reporting standards could affect our reported performance, which in turn could favorably or unfavorably impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, the transition to and application of new accounting or financial reporting standards could result in increased administrative costs.\nMunicipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.\nState statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities. However, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss. If a public agency were to acquire our utility property by eminent domain action, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward.", "PERMNO": 20750, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CWT"}
