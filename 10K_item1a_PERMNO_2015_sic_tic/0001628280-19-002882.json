{"cik": "1502034", "company": "GNC HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors could cause our financial performance to differ significantly from the goals, plans, objectives, intentions and expectations expressed in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our market share, revenues and growth prospects.\nThe market for health, wellness and performance products is large, highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Current and prospective participants include specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi-level marketing organizations, on-line merchants, mail-order companies and a variety of other smaller participants. We believe that the market is also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. In the United States, we compete for sales with heavily advertised national brands manufactured by large pharmaceutical and food companies, as well as other brands, some of which have greater market presence, both brick and mortar and online, name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources, including some competitors that may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, as some products become more mainstream, we experience increased price competition and adverse impacts to category share and growth for those products as more participants enter the market or we fail to anticipate changes to consumer preferences.\nOur international competitors include large international pharmacy chains, major international supermarket chains and other large U.S.-based companies with international operations. Our wholesale and manufacturing operations compete with other wholesalers and manufacturers of third-party nutritional supplements. We may not be able to compete effectively and our attempts to do so may require us to reduce our prices, which may result in lower margins. Failure to effectively compete could adversely affect our market share, revenues and growth prospects.\nFurther, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis through the use of smartphones and digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive pricing. We compete in multiple product categories and sales channels, including large format stores; traditional and specialty formats; mass merchants; and catalog; internet-based and direct-sell retailers; and vendors that sell directly to customers. Many factors affect the extent to which competition could affect our results, including as it relates to pricing, quality, assortment, marketing, promotions and advertising, service, locations, capital expenditures, category share and reputation, and prolonged competitive pressures could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nWe continue to explore new strategic initiatives but we may not be able to successfully execute on, or realize the expected benefit from the implementation of, our strategic initiatives, and our pursuit of new strategic initiatives may pose significant costs and risks.\nThe continued success of our business is contingent on, among other things, the acquisition of new customers and the retention of existing customers. This success depends on our adoption of strategic alternatives, including those focused on improving the customer experience, increasing customer engagement and personalization, providing a relevant and inspiring product assortment and improving customer loyalty and retention. We conducted a vast array of consumer tests, pilot programs and other market research throughout 2015 and 2016 as part of our comprehensive review of our customers\u2019 experience. Based on this work, we launched our One New GNC single-tier pricing model and new customer loyalty programs, myGNC Rewards and PRO Access, at the end of 2016. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our management\u2019s success in implementing these and other strategic initiatives. Also, our short-term operating results could be unfavorably impacted by the opportunity and financial costs associated with the implementation of these strategic plans, and we may not realize the expected benefits from such strategies. In addition, we may not be successful in achieving the intended objectives of these strategic initiatives in a timely manner or at all.\nResources devoted to product innovation may not yield new products that achieve commercial success.\nOur ability to develop new and innovative GNC-branded products depends on, among other factors, our ability to understand evolving customer and market trends and our ability to translate these insights into commercially viable new products. If we are unable to do so, our customer relationships and product sales could be harmed significantly. Furthermore, the nutritional supplements industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our stores as a source for the latest products. This could harm our customer relationships and cause losses to our market share. The development of new and innovative products also requires significant investment in research and development and testing of new ingredients, formulas and possibly new production processes. The R&D process can be expensive and prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty. Products may appear\npromising in development but fail to reach market within the expected time frame, or at all. We may face significant challenges with regard to a key product launch. Further, products also may fail to achieve commercial viability due to pricing competitiveness with other retailers, including online retailers, failure to timely bring the product to market, failure to differentiate the product with our competitors and other reasons. Finally, there is no guarantee that our development teams will be able to successfully respond to competitive products that could render some of our offerings obsolete. Development of a new product, from discovery through testing to the store shelf, typically takes between four to seven months, but may require an even longer timeline if clinical trials are involved. Each of these time periods can vary considerably from product to product and therefore the costs and risks of producing a commercially viable product can increase significantly as time passes.\nDifficulties with our vendors may adversely impact our business.\nOur performance depends on our ability to purchase products at sufficient levels and at competitive prices from vendors who can deliver products in a timely and efficient manner and in compliance with our vendor standards and all applicable laws and regulations. We currently have a large number of vendor relationships. Generally, we do not have any long-term purchase agreements or other contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products. Historically, we have not relied on any single vendor for our products and have not had difficulties replacing vendors for various products we sell. However, in the future there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to acquire desired products in sufficient quantities or on terms acceptable to us, or be able to develop relationships with new vendors to replace any discontinued vendors. Our inability to acquire suitable products in the future or our failure to replace any one or more vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any significant change in the payment terms that we have with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity.\nMany of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items. These smaller vendors generally have limited resources, production capacities and operating histories, and some of our vendors have limited the distribution of their products in the past. Accordingly, these smaller vendors may be more susceptible to cash flow issues, downturns in economic conditions, production difficulties, and quality control issues than larger vendors. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience products out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales. In addition, although we generally have charge-back privileges in our vendor agreements, there is no assurance that we would be able, if necessary, to return product to these vendors, obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from any of our vendors should we so desire, and from time to time, we may be in litigation with one or more vendors. Many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we need. This long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, exposing us to shifts in consumer demand and discretionary spending.\nOther supplier problems that we could face include product shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, supplier financial weaknesses, inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes with suppliers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers, as described above. Given the importance of third-party suppliers to our business, if any of these risks materializes, our ability to obtain raw materials and products and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including electronic payments systems, and our failure to do so, or other problems with these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on various third party information technology systems to manage our operations and the core system needs of our business. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt our operations, including our ability to track, record and analyze the merchandise that we sell, process shipments of goods, process financial information or credit card transactions, deliver products or engage in similar normal business activities. Over the last several years, we have implemented, and we continue to implement, modifications and upgrades to such systems, including changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality, and acquiring new systems with new functionality. These types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems into our current systems. Further, our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, sabotage, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers or sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our associates. Any of these events could lead to system interruptions, including the nonavailability or nonfunctionality of our website, processing and order fulfillment delays and loss of critical data for us, our suppliers or our internet service providers, and could prevent us\nfrom processing customer purchases. Because we are dependent on third-party service providers for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our systems and operations, which may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner, if at all. Accordingly, any computer, internet, network or system disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPrivacy protection is increasingly demanding, and we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with security breaches, data loss, credit card fraud and identity theft that could cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenue, suffer reputational harm with our customers, as well as other risks.\nThe protection of customer, employee, vendor, franchisee and other business data is critical to us. We and our franchisees receive confidential customer data, including payment card and personally identifiable information, in the normal course of customer transactions. In order for our sales channel to function, we and other parties involved in processing customer transactions must be able to transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely over public networks. While we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information, the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures and result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to our data systems and misappropriating confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent a compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable, degrade, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any compromise of our data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage, interruption of our operations, increased operating costs associated with remediation, equipment acquisitions or disposal, added personnel, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business or investor confidence. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and material liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nFederal, state, provincial and international laws and regulations govern the collection, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our employees, customers, vendors and franchisees. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy has been increasingly demanding in recent years, and may see the imposition of new and additional requirements by states and the federal government as well as foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Compliance with these laws and regulations may result in cost increases related to the development of new processes to meet these requirements by us and our franchisees.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our revenues and international growth prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 217 company-owned Canadian stores, 11 company-owned The Health Store stores located in Ireland, 5 company-owned stores located in China, and 1,941 international franchise locations in approximately 50 international countries (including distribution centers where retail sales are made).\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international presence, including through the expansion of franchise locations. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to operating in foreign countries, and any expansion of our international operations will increase the effects of these risks. These risks include, among others:\n\u2022political and economic instability of foreign markets;\n\u2022foreign governments' restrictive trade policies;\n\u2022inconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022the imposition of, or increase in, duties, taxes, government royalties or non-tariff trade barriers;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022difficulty of enforcing contractual obligations of foreign franchisees;\n\u2022increased costs in maintaining international franchise and marketing efforts;\n\u2022problems entering international markets with different cultural bases and consumer preferences;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations applicable to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022operating in new, developing or other markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations relating to contract and intellectual property rights.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and our growth strategy.\nAdditionally, if the opportunity arises, we may expand our operations into new and high-growth international markets. However, there is no assurance that we will expand our operations in such markets in our desired time frame. To expand our operations into new international markets, we may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. We may enter into these transactions to acquire other businesses or products to expand our products or take advantage of new developments and potential changes in the industry. Our lack of experience operating in new international markets and our lack of familiarity with local economic, political and regulatory systems could prevent us from achieving the results that we expect on our anticipated time frame or at all. If we are unsuccessful in expanding into new or high-growth international markets, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur current debt profile and obligations under our debt instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and otherwise adversely impact our operating income and growth prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was $1,152.3 million, including $147.3 million on our Tranche B-1 Term Loan, of which has been fully paid down in the first quarter of 2019, $188.6 million principal amount of 1.5% convertible senior notes due 2020 that the Company issued in a private offering in August 2015 (the \"Notes\") (net of $13.1 million related to the conversion feature and discount), $572.2 million on our Tranche B-2 Term Loan due in 2021, of which $114 million has been paid down in the first quarter of 2019, and $275 million on our asset-based Term Loan due in 2022. Provided that all outstanding amounts under the convertible senior notes exceeding $50.0 million have not been repaid, refinanced, converted or effectively discharged prior May 2020, the maturity date of the Tranche B-2 becomes May 2020, subject to certain adjustments. For additional detail regarding our indebtedness and each of these facilities, see Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\" Note 8, \"Long-Term Debt / Interest Expense.\"\nThis level of debt and their respective payment obligations could materially adversely affect our financial condition. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources, or to obtain future borrowings under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, sell assets or borrow more money, which we may not be able to do on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Further, we may be required to use all or a large portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other business activities.\nIn addition, the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain, and the agreements governing our future indebtedness will likely contain, customary restrictions on us or our subsidiaries, including covenants that restrict us or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, from:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022\ngranting liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nmaking investments;\n\u2022\nconsolidating or merging with, or acquiring, another business;\n\u2022\nselling or otherwise disposing of our assets;\n\u2022\npaying dividends and making other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nincurring capital expenditures in excess of limitations set within the agreement.\nOur $100 million asset-based Revolving Credit Facility requires that, for so long as availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is below a certain level, we meet a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of (a) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, less certain capital expenditures and taxes, to (b) the sum of cash interest expense, scheduled amortization and certain dividends and distributions. If we fail to satisfy such ratio, then we will be restricted from\ndrawing available borrowings under the asset-based Revolving Credit Facility and any amount outstanding may become due and payable subject to defined rights to cure, which may impair our liquidity.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions of our Senior Credit Facility may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt obligations, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable subject to defined rights to cure. A default on any of our debt obligations could trigger certain acceleration clauses and cause those and our other obligations to become due and payable subject to defined rights to cure. Upon an acceleration of any of our debt, we may not be able to make payments under our other outstanding debt.\nIn addition, the size of our current indebtedness, and the restrictions imposed under our current debt documents may increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and industry, and restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or capitalizing on business opportunities and generally place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nOur retail operations are dependent on securing suitable store locations. Our operations require us to maintain significant lease obligations, which may require us to continue paying rent for store locations that we no longer operate.\nOur sales are affected, in part, by the location of our stores, especially in the United States. Our business is contingent on consumer traffic being driven to our store locations, which may be adversely affected by, among other factors, economic downturns, the closing or continued decline of anchor department stores and/or specialty stores in malls or other developments where our stores are located, and a decline in the popularity of shopping among our target customers. Further, any terrorist act, natural disaster, public health or safety concern that decreases the level of shopping traffic generally, or that affects our ability to open and operate stores in such locations, could have a material adverse effect on our business. To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations such as in regional and neighborhood malls, as well as high-traffic urban retail areas and streets. We cannot be certain that desirable locations will continue to be available at favorable rates. Some traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic, driven by economic conditions as well as the closure of certain mall anchor tenants.\nSubstantially all of our retail stores are leased, including stores that we lease and sublease to franchisees in the United States. We are subject to various risks associated with our current and future real estate leases. Our costs could increase because of changes in the real estate markets and supply or demand for real estate sites. We generally cannot cancel our leases, so if we decide to close or relocate a location (or a franchisee fails), we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including paying the base rent for the remaining lease term. As each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all and may not be able to find replacement locations that will provide for the same success as current store locations.\nIf we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOmni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop online. As part of our omni-channel strategy, we anticipate the need to continue making investments in technology. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our e-commerce businesses or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, lost sales, or data security breaches, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on our manufacturing operations to produce a significant amount of the products we sell, disruptions in our manufacturing system or losses of manufacturing certifications could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships.\nOur manufacturing operations produced approximately 25% of the products we sold in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Other than powders, chewables and liquids, nearly all of our proprietary products are produced in our manufacturing facility located in Greenville, South Carolina. Any significant disruption in our operations at our Greenville, South Carolina facility for any reason, including as a result of regulatory requirements, an FDA determination that the facility is not in compliance with the cGMP regulations, the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war or other force of nature, could disrupt our supply of products, adversely affecting our sales and customer relationships.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products, the ingredients they contain and any similar products distributed by other companies could cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the demand for our products and our ability to generate revenues and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumer perception of the safety and quality of our products and the ingredients they contain, as well as that of similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer perception of products and the ingredients they contain can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention and other publicity about product use. A future research report or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less favorable or that questions earlier research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues. As such, period-to-period comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as a measure of our future performance. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of our products or the ingredients they contain or any other similar products distributed by other companies with illness or other adverse effects, that questions the benefits of our or similar products, or that claims that such products are ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the demand for our products, our ability to generate revenues and the market price of our common stock.\nOur success also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand, consumer preferences, and shopping patterns regarding nutritional supplements. Consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to continual change and evolution. Additionally, our customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through e-Commerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels or media (through online and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media), which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of the proposed delivery which may make it more difficult for us to adapt to changes in consumer preferences.\nOur sales may decline significantly if we misjudge the market for our new products, which may result in significant inventory markdowns and lower margins, missed opportunities for other products, or inventory write-downs, and could have a negative impact on our reputation and profitability.\nA significant disruption to our distribution network, inventory management system, or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales and operations or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.\nWe rely on our ability to replenish depleted inventory in our stores through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from the distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea and truck. Unexpected delays in those deliveries or increases in transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs) could significantly decrease our ability to make sales and earn profits. In addition, labor shortages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.\nWe must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, we also must guard against accumulating excess inventory. If we fail to anticipate accurately either the market for the merchandise in our stores or our customers\u2019 purchasing habits, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA substantial amount of our revenue is generated from our franchisees, and our revenues could decrease significantly if our franchisees do not conduct their operations profitably or if we fail to attract new franchisees.\nOur franchise operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our revenues from franchise stores depend on the franchisees' ability to operate their stores profitably and adhere to our franchise standards. The closing of franchise stores or the failure of franchisees to comply with our policies could adversely affect our reputation and could reduce the amount of our franchise revenues. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating income.\nIf we are unable to attract new franchisees or to convince existing franchisees to open additional stores, any growth in royalties from franchise stores will depend solely upon increases in revenues at existing franchise stores. In addition, our ability to open additional franchise locations is limited by the territorial restrictions in our existing franchise agreements as well as our ability to identify additional markets in the United States and other countries. If we are unable to open additional franchise locations, we will have to sustain additional growth internally by attracting new and repeat customers to our existing locations.\nWe may incur material product liability claims, or experience product recalls, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our sales and margin, reputation, revenues and operating income.\nAs a retailer, distributor and manufacturer of products designed for human consumption, we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury. Our products consist of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. Our products could contain contaminated substances, and some of our products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur.\nIn addition, third-party manufacturers produce many of the products we sell. We rely on these manufacturers to ensure the integrity of their ingredients and formulations. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, we may also be liable for various product liability claims for products we do not manufacture. Our ultimate liability for these products that are manufactured by third parties depends on a number of factors, including our contractual relationship with the vendor, the creditworthiness of the vendor and any insurance that we have. Therefore, we may be unable to adequately protect ourselves against claims with respect to products manufactured by a third-party.\nWe have been and may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. See Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\" Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, product liability claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products, regardless of the merits or outcomes of such claims. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nIn addition, we may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of the products we formulate, manufacture or sell are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of such products. A significant recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of the products we manufacture or sell may require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected costs and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products may adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and thus decrease consumer demand for our products.\nIn the past, due to frequently changing consumer preferences in the dietary supplement space, we have offset losses related to recalls and removals with reformulated or alternative products; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to offset all or any portion of losses related to any future removal or recall. As a result of the indeterminable level of product substitution and reformulated product sales, we cannot reliably determine the potential impact of any such recall or removal on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nAn increase in the price and shortage of supply of key raw materials could adversely affect our business.\nOur products are composed of certain key raw materials. If the prices of these raw materials were to increase significantly, our costs to manufacture the product could increase, the prices our contract manufacturers and third-party manufacturers charge us for our GNC-branded products and third-party products could increase significantly and we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers. Additionally, in the event any of our, or our contract manufacturer\u2019s, third-party suppliers or vendors become unable or unwilling to continue to provide raw materials in the required volumes and quality levels or in a timely manner, we, or our contract manufacturers, would be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement supply sources. If we, or they, are unable to identify and obtain alternative supply sources in a timely manner or at all, our business could be adversely affected. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Events such as the threat of political or social unrest, or the perceived threat thereof, may also have a significant impact on raw material prices and transportation costs for our products. In addition, the interruption in supply of certain key raw materials essential to the manufacturing of our products may have an adverse impact on our suppliers' ability to provide us with the necessary products needed to maintain our customer relationships and an adequate level of sales.\nGeneral trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating in 2018, with multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect during 2018. Furthermore, China or other countries may institute retaliatory trade measures in response to existing or future tariffs imposed by the U.S. that could have a negative impact on our business. If any of these events continue as described, we may need to seek alternative suppliers or vendors, raise prices, or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral economic conditions, including a prolonged weakness in the economy, may affect consumer purchases, which could adversely affect our sales and the sales of our business partners, as well as our ability to access credit on terms previously obtained.\nOur results, and those of our business partners to whom we sell, are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer spending, including general economic and business conditions; consumer confidence; wages and employment levels; the housing market; consumer debt levels; availability of consumer credit; credit and interest rates; fuel and energy costs; energy shortages; taxes; general political conditions, both domestic and abroad; and the level of customer traffic within department stores, malls and other shopping and selling environments. Consumer product purchases, including purchases of our products, may decline during recessionary periods. Further, historically, credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced disruption\ncharacterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions, increased volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability and intervention from the United States and other governments.\nContinued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term or widespread downturn, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the global commercial and residential real estate markets and related mortgage markets and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility. The cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by these conditions. A prolonged downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economy may materially adversely affect our business, revenues and profits and the market price of our common stock, and we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from our existing financial institutions and the credit markets if needed, and if available, to the extent required and on acceptable terms. If we cannot obtain funding when needed, in each case on acceptable terms, we may be unable to adequately fund our operating expenses and fund required capital expenditures, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nCompliance with new and existing laws and governmental regulations could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the USDA, and the EPA. These activities are also regulated by various state, local and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, manufacture, labeling and marketing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). Dietary supplements and dietary ingredients that do not comply with FDA\u2019s regulations and/or the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (\"DSHEA\") will be deemed adulterated or misbranded. Manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded, and the FDA may take enforcement action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement on the market. The FDA has broad enforcement powers. If we violate applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA may bring enforcement actions against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk based on the required submission of serious adverse events or other information, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a \"health claim.\" See Item 1, \"Business-Government Regulation-Product Regulation\" for additional information. Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements with respect to those products. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to an increased risk of litigation and liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.\nAdditional or more stringent laws and regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. In addition, regulators' evolving interpretation of existing laws could have similar effects.\nFurther, our franchise activities are subject to federal, state and international laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises and the governance of our franchise relationships. These laws impose registration, extensive disclosure requirements and bonding requirements on the offer and sale of franchises. In some jurisdictions, the laws relating to the governance of our franchise relationship impose fair dealing standards during the term of the franchise relationship and limitations on our ability to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. We may, therefore, be required to retain an underperforming franchise and may be unable to replace the franchisee, which could adversely impact franchise revenues. In addition, we cannot predict the nature and effect of any future legislation or regulation on our franchise operations.\nAdditionally, due to our significant international operations we are subject to The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which is broader in scope than the FCPA, that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Our continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of FCPA\nviolations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with FTC regulations and the consent decree imposed on us by the FTC could result in substantial monetary penalties and could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and requires that all advertising to consumers be truthful and non-misleading. The FTC actively monitors the dietary supplement space and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies, including us, for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. As a result of these enforcement actions, we are currently subject to a consent decree that limits our ability to make certain claims with respect to our hair care products. See Item 1, \"Business-Government Regulation-Product Regulation\" for more information. Failure by us or our franchisees to comply with the consent decree and applicable regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect our brand name, competitors may adopt trade names that dilute the value of our brand name, and prosecuting or defending infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using some aspect of our products, which could adversely affect our revenues and market share.\nWe have invested significant resources to promote our GNC brand name in order to obtain the public recognition that we have today. Because of the differences in foreign trademark laws concerning proprietary rights, our trademarks may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States. Also, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others. For example, we are currently engaged in trademark disputes in foreign jurisdictions over \"GNC\", \"LIVE WELL\" and other similar trademarks and trademark applications. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and effectiveness of our past and future marketing efforts and could cause customer confusion. This could in turn adversely affect our revenues, profitability and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently and may in the future be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using some aspect of our products. Claims of intellectual property infringement also may require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Claims that our technology or products infringe on intellectual property rights could be costly and would divert the attention of management and key personnel, which in turn could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holdings Co., Ltd. pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, as previously disclosed, reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, may further dilute the ownership of such holders, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs previously disclosed, on February 13, 2018, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended from time to time, the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holdings Co., Ltd. (the \u201cInvestor\u201d), pursuant to which the Company has issued and sold to the Investor, and the Investor agreed to purchase from the Company, 299,950 shares of a newly created series of convertible preferred stock of the Company, designated the \u201cSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d (the \u201cConvertible Preferred Stock\u201d), for a purchase price of $1,000 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $300 million (the \u201cSecurities Purchase\u201d). The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $5.35 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Investor assigned its interest in the Securities Purchase Agreement to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., a company incorporated in the People's Republic of China (\"Harbin\"). The transactions were effectuated as follows: (i) 100,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were issued on November 8, 2018 for a total purchase price of $100,000,000, (ii) 50,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were issued on January 2, 2019 for a total purchase price of $50,000,000 and (iii) 149,950 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were issued on February 13, 2019 for a total purchase price of $149,950,000.\nHarbin currently owns all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, and based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018, plus the additional Convertible Preferred Stock subsequently issued to Harbin, the Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Harbin is convertible into approximately 40.1% of our common stock. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends, payable quarterly in arrears, at an annual rate of 6.5% of the stated value of the Convertible Preferred Stock, and are entitled to vote together with the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock as a single class, in each case, on an as-converted basis. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock also have certain limited special approval rights, including over amendments to the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, bylaws or other charter documents, including the Certificate of Designations in any manner that adversely affects any rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Convertible Preferred Stock or holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.\nConversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We have granted Harbin registration rights in respect of the shares of common stock underlying the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of these shares of our common stock into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by Harbin of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe are required to pay dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to our common stock, and we may be required under certain circumstances to repurchase the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock; such obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nHolders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends, payable quarterly in arrears, at an annual rate of 6.5% of the stated value of $1,000 per share, subject to increase in connection with the payment of dividends in kind. Dividends are payable, at the Company\u2019s option, in cash from legally available funds or in kind by issuing additional shares of Convertible Preferred Stock with such stated value equal to the amount of payment being made or by increasing the stated value of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock by the amount per share of the dividend or in a combination thereof. In addition, the holders of our Convertible Preferred Stock have certain redemption rights, including upon certain change in control events involving us, which, if exercised, could require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, prior to any distributions to holders of our common stock or other capital stock of the Company ranking junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock. Our obligations to pay dividends to the holders of our Convertible Preferred Stock or any required repurchase of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for distribution to holders of our common stock, or for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Convertible Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nHarbin may exercise significant influence over us, including through its ability to elect up to five members of our Board of Directors.\nBased on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018, plus the additional Convertible Preferred Stock subsequently issued to Harbin, the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Harbin represent approximately 40.1% of the voting rights of our common stock, on an as-converted basis, so Harbin will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement between the Company and Harbin, Harbin has the right to designate up to five directors (each an \u201cInvestor Designee\u201d) to the Board. The number of Investor Designees may be adjusted from time to time, not to exceed five, in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, to equal Harbin or its assigns\u2019 proportionate ownership of the Company, rounded up to the nearest whole number of directors. When Harbin\u2019s ownership of the Company falls below 15% of the outstanding common stock on as-converted basis, Harbin will no longer have the right to designate directors. Each of the Investor Designees is required to be reasonably satisfactory to the Company\u2019s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Harbin and its affiliates may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders. For example, Harbin and its affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us.\nThe terms and features of our current Notes may have a negative impact on our liquidity, dilution or reported financial results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Further, upon the occurrence of certain \u201cfundamental changes\u201d, holders of our Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation, as well as our repurchase obligations, through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash upon conversions of Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any\napplicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nIn addition, the effect of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nWe operate a portion of our business with joint venture partners, which may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility; actions taken by the other partner may materially impact our financial position and results of operations; and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from a joint venture.\nIn connection with Harbin\u2019s investment in the Company, we entered into a commercial joint venture in Hong Kong with respect to our e-commerce business in China (the \u201cHK JV\u201d). The HK JV has an exclusive right to use our trademarks and manufacture and distribute our products in China (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) via e-commerce channels. The HK JV is controlled 65% by Harbin and 35% by the Company. Likewise, we are in the process of forming a second joint venture with Harbin in China (the \u201cChina JV\u201d) to operate GNC\u2019s retail business in China. The China JV will have an exclusive right to use our trademarks and manufacture and distribute our products in China (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau) via retail stores and pharmacies. Finally, on March 1, 2019 we entered into a joint venture arrangement with IVC regarding our Nutra manufacturing business (the \u201cManufacturing JV\u201d). The Manufacturing JV is controlled 57% by IVC and 43% by the Company, and the Company\u2019s ownership percentage will decrease over the next four years until IVC owns 100% of the Manufacturing JV. These relationships require us to share or cede operational control with respect to a critical portion of our market or product supply source, such that we may no longer have the flexibility to control completely the long-term manufacturing strategy. If we do not timely meet our commitments in such circumstances, our rights may be adversely affected. If our joint venture partners are unable or fail to uphold their obligations or do not operate in accordance with our expectations, our costs of operations could be increased, our revenue could decrease, and our reputation and brand could be adversely impacted. We could also incur liability as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners. Disputes between us and Harbin or IVC may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate product development and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nWe depend on the services of key executives and other skilled professionals and our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates. Any failure to attract or retain such individuals could affect our business strategy and adversely impact our performance and results of operations.\nOur senior executives are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying opportunities and arranging necessary financing. In addition, other key employees below the executive level, who are skilled professionals with deep knowledge of our business, are critical to the execution and success of our strategy. Our success also depends on the continued contributions of our store and field associates. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates.\nLosing the services of any of these groups of individuals could adversely affect our business and we may be unable to identify candidates of sufficient experience and capabilities in a timely fashion or at all, which could negatively impact our business and operations. Further, our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these store and field associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain qualified store and field associates in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are not insured for a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could materially and adversely affect our operating income and profitability.\nWe have procured insurance independently for the following areas: (1) general liability; (2) product liability; (3) directors and officers liability; (4) network security and privacy liability; (5) property losses; (6) workers' compensation; (7) employment practice; and (8) various other areas. In addition, although we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain insurance in these areas in the future, because of increased selectivity by insurance providers, we may only be able to obtain such insurance at increased rates and/or with reduced coverage levels. Furthermore, we are self-insured for other areas, including: (1) physical\ndamage to our vehicles for field personnel use; and (2) physical damages that may occur at company-owned stores. We are not insured for some property and casualty risks due to the frequency and severity of a loss, the cost of insurance and the overall risk analysis. In addition, we carry product liability insurance coverage that requires us to pay deductibles/retentions with primary and excess liability coverage above the retention amount. Because of our deductibles and self-insured retention amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. We currently maintain product liability insurance with a retention of $4.0 million per claim with an aggregate cap on retained loss of $10.0 million. We could raise our deductibles/retentions, which would increase our already significant exposure to expense from claims. If any claim exceeds our coverage, we would bear the excess expense, in addition to our other self-insured amounts. If the frequency or severity of claims or our expenses increase, our operating income and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations or expose us to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges from our operations into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water and groundwater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for remedial actions, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. New laws, changes in existing laws or the interpretation thereof, or the development of new facts or changes in their processes could also cause us to incur additional capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations and environmental permits. For example, in March 2008, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (the \"DHEC\") requested that we investigate contamination associated with historical activities at our South Carolina facility. Any failure by us to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of our operations, including operations at our manufacturing facility. We also could incur monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims or cleanup or other costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such requirements.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment without regard to fault or knowledge about the condition or action causing the liability. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or for properties to which substances or wastes that were sent in connection with current or former operations at its facilities. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could also adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties, or to use them as collateral for financing.\nOur franchisees are independent operators and we have limited influence over their activities, including their implementation of strategic marketing and advertising programs.\nOur revenues substantially depend upon our franchisees' sales volumes, profitability and financial viability. The support of our franchisees is critical for the success of our marketing programs and other strategic initiatives we seek to undertake, and the successful execution of these initiatives will depend on our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees. However, our franchisees are independent operators and we cannot control many factors that impact the profitability of their stores. Pursuant to the franchise agreements, we can, among other things, mandate signage, equipment and hours of operation, establish operating procedures and approve suppliers, distributors and products, as well as certain strategic initiatives. However, the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, and we need the active support of our franchisees if the implementation of our strategic initiatives is to be successful. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or standards set by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. In addition, franchisees may not hire and train qualified managers and other personnel. Our efforts to build alignment with franchisees may result in a delay in the implementation of our marketing and advertising programs and other key initiatives. Although we believe that our current relationships with our franchisees are generally good, there can be no assurance that our franchisees will continue to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives.\nWhile we ultimately can take action to terminate franchisees that do not comply with the standards contained in our franchise agreements, any delay in identifying and addressing problems could harm our image and reputation, and our franchise revenues and results of operations could decline.\nAdditionally, we have limited influence over their ability to invest in other businesses or incur excessive indebtedness. In some cases, these franchisees have used the cash generated by their stores to expand their other businesses or to subsidize losses incurred by such businesses. Additionally, as independent operators, franchisees do not require our consent to incur indebtedness. Consequently, our franchisees have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial distress as a result of over leveraging. To the extent that our franchisees use the cash from their GNC stores to subsidize their other businesses or experience financial distress, due to over leverage or otherwise, it could negatively affect (1) our operating results as a result of delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund contributions and rents for properties we lease to them, (2) our future revenue, earnings\nand cash flow growth (3) our financial condition and (4) our reputation. In addition, lenders that are adversely affected by franchisees who default on their indebtedness may be less likely to provide current or prospective franchisees necessary financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes may result in financial losses.\nWe may from time to time utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in fuel and certain other commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We could recognize losses on these contracts or fail to recognize the benefits intended by these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or to the extent that a counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these instruments involves judgment or use of estimates. Furthermore, changes in the value of derivatives designated under hedge accounting to the extent not fully offset by changes in the value of the hedged transaction can result in ineffectiveness losses that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have recognized impairment charges in the past and may recognize additional such charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe evaluate goodwill and our indefinite-lived brand intangible asset for impairment on at least an annual basis. We evaluate property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for recoverability when indicators of impairment exist. We will recognize an impairment charge if: our indefinite-lived brand intangible asset has a carrying value that exceeds its estimated fair value; our goodwill has a carrying value for an applicable reporting unit that exceeds its fair value; or our property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets have estimated future undiscounted cash flows that are less than the applicable carrying values. In assessing fair value, we rely primarily on a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies. These analyses rely on the judgments and estimates of management, which involve inherent uncertainties. Impairment losses are significantly affected by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value as well as the Company's total market capitalization. Estimates of future operating cash flows are identified from strategic long-term plans, which are based upon experience, knowledge, and expectations; however, these estimates can be affected by such factors as future operating results, future store profitability, future volumes, revenue and expense growth rates and asset disposal values and future economic conditions, all of which can be difficult to predict accurately. Any significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could affect the fair value of our long-lived assets and could result in future impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations. For example, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $38.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. While we currently believe that the fair values of our long-lived assets exceed their respective carrying values, changes in our estimates and assumptions regarding the future performance of our business could result in further impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and overall financial condition.\nOur holding company structure makes us dependent on our subsidiaries for our cash flow and subordinates the rights of our stockholders to the rights of creditors of our subsidiaries in the event of an insolvency or liquidation of any of our subsidiaries.\nHoldings is a holding company and, accordingly, substantially all of our operations are conducted through its subsidiaries. Holdings' subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. As a result, Holdings' cash flow depends upon the earnings of its subsidiaries. In addition, Holdings depends on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by its subsidiaries. Holdings' subsidiaries have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations. If there is an insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of Holdings' subsidiaries, Holdings' stockholders will have no right to proceed against their assets. Creditors of those subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of those subsidiaries before Holdings, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale or disposal.\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has varied during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 between a high of $5.26 on January 18, 2018 and a low of $2.25 on December 21, 2018. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including those additional factors discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report, as well as: variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or other investors; revisions in analyst estimates or announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; or the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock.\nNatural disasters (whether or not caused by climate change), unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and global political events could cause permanent or temporary distribution center or store closures, impair our ability to purchase, receive or replenish inventory or cause customer traffic to decline, all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes (whether or not caused by climate change), unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. To the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, a significant number of stores, a manufacturing facility or our corporate headquarters, or impact one or more of our key suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries to our stores and through lost sales. In addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption to our information systems. These events also could have indirect consequences, such as increases in the cost of insurance, if they were to result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nOur current and historical effective tax rate may not be indicative of future rates.\nOn December 22, 2017, United States tax reform legislation known as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This rate reduction is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, our future effective tax rate may differ from current and historical rates due to the 2017 Tax Act. Furthermore, in light of our global earnings mix, future changes in domestic and international tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as changes to our tax positions could also impact the effective tax rate on a prospective basis.", "PERMNO": 12660, "SIC": 5400, "TIC": "GNCIQ"}
