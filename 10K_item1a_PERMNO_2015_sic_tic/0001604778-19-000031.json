RISK FACTORS.\nOur operating results fluctuate.\nOur revenue, earnings, margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. If demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons, our revenue and profitability could be impacted. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nbusiness, political and macroeconomic changes, including trade disputes and downturns in the semiconductor industry and the overall global economy;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer confidence caused by many factors, including changes in interest rates, credit markets, expectations for inflation, unemployment levels, and energy or other commodity prices;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast our customers' demand for our products accurately;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third-party foundries and other third-party suppliers to manufacture, assemble and test our products in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 and distributors\u2019 ability to manage the inventory that they hold and to forecast accurately their demand for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve cost savings and improve yields and margins on our new and existing products;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize the expected benefits of any acquisitions or strategic investments, including our recent acquisition of Active-Semi International, Inc. (\u201cActive-Semi\u201d); and\n\u2022\nour ability to utilize our capacity efficiently or to acquire additional capacity in response to customer demand.\nIt is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors. In addition, any prolonged adverse effect on revenue could alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short-term and long-term strategies. If our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors, our stock price may decline.\nOur operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins as our industry\u2019s product life cycles are short and our customers' requirements change rapidly.\nOur largest markets are characterized by short product life cycles and the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product requirements, driven by end user demand for more functionality, improved performance, lower costs and smaller form factors. Our largest MP customers typically refresh some or all of their product portfolios by releasing new models each year. In some cases, product designs we pursue represent either opportunities to substantially increase our revenue by winning a new design or a risk of a substantial revenue loss by losing an incumbent product in a customer's device.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner and secure production orders from our customers. The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past. Our successful product development depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to predict market requirements and define and design new products that address those requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to design products that meet our customers\u2019 cost, size and performance requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products that are competitive and can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance;\n\u2022\nacceptance of our new product designs;\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified product design engineers;\n\u2022\nour timely completion of product designs and ramp up of new products according to our customers\u2019 needs with acceptable manufacturing yields; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our customers\u2019 products and the duration of the life cycle of such products.\nWe may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or cost-efficient manner, and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements. Most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors, and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performing product. If we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins against our competitors, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected. Even when a design win is achieved, our success is not assured. Design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more. Many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices, which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win. In many cases, the average selling prices of our products decline over the products\u2019 lives, and we must achieve yield improvements, cost reductions and other productivity enhancements in order to maintain profitability. The actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers\u2019 products.\nWe depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nA substantial portion of our MP revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers. Our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base. Collectively, our two largest end customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 45%, 44% and 45% of our revenue for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe top-tier cellular handset OEMs are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis, which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities. While the financial rewards and market affirmation from a design win for these premier customers are greater, competition for these projects is intense. The concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors, both positive and negative, affecting those customers. If demand for their products increases, our results are favorably impacted, while if demand for their products decreases, they may reduce their purchases of, or stop purchasing, our products and our operating results would suffer. Even if we achieve a design win, our customers can delay or cancel the release of a new handset for any reason. Most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their devices with little notice to us and with little or no penalty. The loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the United States government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced.\nWe receive a portion of our revenue from the United States government and from prime contractors on United States government-sponsored programs, principally for defense and aerospace applications. These programs are subject to delays or cancellation. Further, spending on defense and aerospace programs can vary significantly depending on funding from the United States government. We believe our government and defense and aerospace business has been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending. Reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe depend heavily on third parties.\nWe purchase numerous component parts, substrates and silicon-based products from external suppliers. We also utilize third-party suppliers for numerous services, including die processing, wafer bumping, test and tape and reel. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity constraints, manufacturing yields, product quality and fabrication costs.\nAlthough our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable ISO 9001 and/or TS-16949 quality standards, we have experienced quality and reliability issues in the past with certain suppliers. Quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products, our reputation and our results of operations.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products through third party distributors. We depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors\u2019 technical support and favorable business terms related to payments, discounts and stocking of acceptable inventory levels. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products. Our distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by our distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nWe face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities.\nWe operate wafer fabrication facilities in Florida, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. We currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers, as well as internal assembly facilities in China, Costa Rica, Germany and the U.S., to assemble and test our products. We currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in China, Costa Rica and the U.S., and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in Asia to test our products.\nA number of factors related to our facilities will affect our business and financial results, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust production capacity in a timely fashion in response to changes in demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe significant fixed costs of operating the facilities;\n\u2022\nfactory utilization rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to qualify our facilities for new products and new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe availability of raw materials, the impact of the volatility of commodity pricing and tariffs imposed on raw materials, including substrates, gold, platinum and high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, indium, silicon, phosphorous and palladium;\n\u2022\nour manufacturing cycle times;\n\u2022\nour manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nthe political, regulatory and economic risks associated with our international manufacturing operations;\n\u2022\npotential violations by our international employees or third-party agents of international or U.S. laws relevant to foreign operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and manage qualified production personnel;\n\u2022\nour compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid prolonged periods of down-time in our facilities for any reason.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters, industrial accidents, cybersecurity incidents, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, extreme weather conditions, public health issues, military actions, acts of terrorism, political or regulatory issues and other man-made disasters or catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms and flooding. We carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks, with limits we deem adequate, for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations. However, the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent that losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers. Furthermore, even if our own operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a business disruption, natural disaster or catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their orders, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we experience poor manufacturing yields, our operating results may suffer.\nOur products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex. In many cases, our products are assembled in customized packages. Many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity. Our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality, performance and reliability. Our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test yields. Defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module, which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled. Due to the complexity of our products, we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues, particularly with respect to new products.\nOur customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products. The number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022\ndesign errors;\n\u2022\ndefects in photomasks (which are used to print circuits on a wafer);\n\u2022\nminute impurities and variations in materials used;\n\u2022\ncontamination of the manufacturing environment;\n\u2022\nequipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nlosses from broken wafers or other human error; and\n\u2022\ndefects in substrates and packaging.\nWe constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields. Typically, for a given level of sales, when our yields improve, our gross margins improve, and when our yields decrease, our unit costs are higher, our margins are lower, and our operating results are adversely affected.\nCosts of product defects and deviations from required specifications could include the following:\n\u2022\nwriting off inventory;\n\u2022\nscrapping products that cannot be fixed;\n\u2022\naccepting returns of products that have been shipped;\n\u2022\nproviding product replacements at no charge;\n\u2022\nreimbursement of direct and indirect costs incurred by our customers in recalling or reworking their products due to defects in our products;\n\u2022\ntravel and personnel costs to investigate potential product quality issues and to identify or confirm the failure mechanism or root cause of product defects; and\n\u2022\ndefending against litigation.\nThese costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins. Our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues, and product demand could be reduced, which could harm our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products.\nIn order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest end customers, we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers. However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer. As a result, we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales. Because demand for our products may not materialize, or may be lower than expected, manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs, increased obsolescence and higher operating costs. These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers\u2019 accumulated levels of inventory. If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write-off inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results.\nWe sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers, and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business.\nPlatform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for OEMs and ODMs that include the platform provider\u2019s baseband and other complementary products. A platform provider may own or control IP that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards, which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of RF products for these standards. Platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide RF products to their customers as part of the overall system design, and we competed with other RF companies to have our products included in the platform provider\u2019s system reference design. This market dynamic has evolved in recent years as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own RF technologies and components.\nPlatform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor. Accordingly, we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors. Because platform providers control the overall system reference design, if they offer competitive RF technologies or their own RF solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design, we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with OEMs and ODMs that are seeking a turn-key design solution, even if our products offer superior performance. This requires us to work more closely with OEMs and ODMs to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices.\nOur relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving, and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks from international sales and operations.\nWe operate globally with sales offices and R&D activities as well as manufacturing, assembly and test facilities in multiple countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in Asia. As a result, we are subject to regulatory, geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S., including:\n\u2022\nglobal and local economic, social and political conditions and uncertainty;\n\u2022\ncurrency controls and fluctuations;\n\u2022\nformal or informal imposition of export, import or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs and other related restrictions;\n\u2022\nlabor market conditions and workers\u2019 rights affecting our manufacturing operations or those of our customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in capital and securities and commodities trading markets;\n\u2022\noccurrences of geopolitical crises such as terrorist activity, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability, which may disrupt manufacturing, assembly, logistics, security and communications and result in reduced demand for our products;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations that differ among jurisdictions, including those covering taxes, intellectual property ownership and infringement, imports and exports, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, data privacy, and environment, health, and safety; and\n\u2022\npandemics and similar major health concerns, which could adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns.\nSales to customers located outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 84% of our revenue in fiscal 2019, of which approximately 57% and 18% were attributable to sales to customers located in China and Taiwan, respectively. We expect that revenue from international sales to China and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue. Any weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business. The imposition by the U.S. of tariffs on goods imported from China, countermeasures imposed by China in response, U.S. export restrictions on sales of products to China and other government actions that restrict or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers, could increase our manufacturing costs and reduce our product sales in China and other markets.\nAs a global company, our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates. Our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations, and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results. The functional currency for most of our international operations is the U.S. dollar. We have foreign operations in Asia, Europe and Costa Rica, and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the U.S. Our international revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreign-based operations are, in some instances, denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies, such as the Costa Rican Colon, Euro, Pound Sterling, Renminbi and Singapore Dollar. If the U.S. dollar weakens compared to these and other currencies, our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into U.S. dollars.\nEconomic regulation in China could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in China. For many years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid growth and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and to contain inflation, including currency controls and measures designed to restrict credit, control prices or set currency exchange rates. Such actions in the future, as well as other changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including actions in furtherance of China\u2019s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers, could increase the cost of doing business in China, foster the emergence of Chinese-based competitors, decrease the demand for our products in China, or reduce the supply of critical materials for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries, particularly in China. For example, between July 2018 and May 2019, the Office of the United States Trade Representative imposed 25% tariffs on specified product lists, including certain electronic components and equipment, totaling approximately $250 billion in Chinese imports. In response, China imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The U.S. government has also threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $325 billion of Chinese imports, and China has threatened additional retaliatory actions. While the imposition of these tariffs did not have a direct, material adverse impact on our business during fiscal year 2019, the direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China economic and trade policy disagreement. For example, imposition of tariffs on our customers\u2019 products that are imported from China to the U.S. could harm sales\nof such products, which would harm our business. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation.\nFurthermore, we have experienced restrictions on our ability to sell products to certain foreign customers where sales of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action. The U.S. government has in the past issued export restrictions that effectively banned American companies from selling products to ZTE, one of our customers, and in May 2019 imposed a similar ban on sales of all products to Huawei, which accounted for 13% of our total revenue during fiscal 2019. As of the date of this report, we are unable to predict the scope and duration of the export restrictions imposed on Huawei and the corresponding future effects on our business. Even if such restrictions are lifted, any financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed on Huawei could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations. In addition, Huawei or other foreign customers affected by future U.S. government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by adopting our foreign competitors\u2019 solutions.\nMoreover, U.S. government actions targeting exports of certain technologies to China are becoming more pervasive. For example, in 2018, the U.S. adopted new laws designed to address concerns about the export of emerging and foundational technologies to China. In addition, in May 2019, President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in transactions that imposed undue national security risks. These actions could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain technologies, including products we provide to China-based customers.\nThe loss or temporary loss of Huawei or other foreign customers or the imposition of restrictions on our ability to sell products to such customers as a result of tariffs, export restrictions or other U.S. regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our sales, business and results of operations.\nWe operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies.\nWe compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling RF solutions, as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules. In addition to our direct competitors, some of our largest end customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products. Increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products, reduced demand for our products, losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development, engineering and manufacturing costs.\nMany of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions, historical affiliations with OEMs, considerable internal manufacturing capacity, established IP rights and substantial technological capabilities. The semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years, a trend we expect to continue. Many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors.\nIndustry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIt is difficult to predict future demand for our products, which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity and avoid periods of overcapacity. Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products also can lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market.\nCapacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers. In recent years, we have made significant capital investments to expand our premium filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns. In certain cases, these capacity additions exceeded the near-term demand requirements, leading to overcapacity situations and underutilization of our manufacturing facilities.\nAs many of our manufacturing costs are fixed, these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods of underutilization. Underutilization of our manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease, we may be required to close or idle facilities and write down our long-lived assets or shorten the useful lives of underutilized assets and accelerate depreciation, which would increase our expenses. For example, to address manufacturing overcapacity, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we commenced a phased closure of a SAW filter manufacturing facility in Florida and a transfer of production to our North Carolina facility, which we expect will be completed by the end of fiscal 2020. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we announced the temporary idling of a BAW manufacturing facility in Texas. These actions resulted in impairment charges, accelerated depreciation and other restructuring-related costs and expenses.\nWe may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing.\nOn December 5, 2017, we entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and a syndicate of lenders (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement includes a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. This facility contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, including our Notes, or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements, which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes a $400.0 million senior delayed draw term loan (the \"Term Loan\"), of which $100.0 million was funded at closing and then subsequently repaid during March 2018. At our discretion, we may draw down the remaining balance in up to two advances prior to June 30, 2019. Additionally, we may request that the Term Loan or the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed $300.0 million.\nIn November 2015, we issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\") and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\") pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 19, 2015 (the \"2015 Indenture\"). During fiscal 2019, we completed the repurchase of all of the 2023 Notes and all but $23.4 million of the 2025 Notes. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, we issued $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\" and together with the 2025 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d) pursuant to an indenture dated as of July 16, 2018 (as supplemented, the \u201c2018 Indenture\u201d and together with the 2015 Indenture, the \u201cIndentures\u201d).\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Term Loan and the Notes, and to fund working capital, planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay our debt, including the Term Loan and the Notes. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations. Additionally, the Credit Agreement and the Indentures limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the Term Loan and the Indentures governing the Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility. If we violate covenants under the Credit Agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe price of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic and political conditions, including market conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n\u2022\nactual or expected variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndifferences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperations and stock performance of competitors and major customers;\n\u2022\naccounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill and restructuring;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions, strategic alliances, capital commitments, or new products announced by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our common stock;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nloss of key customers.\nWe cannot assure that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance.\nDamage to our reputation or brand could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers and other stakeholders. If we fail to address issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, we could significantly harm our reputation and our brand. Our reputation may also be damaged by how we respond to corporate crises. Corporate crises can arise from catastrophic events as well as from incidents involving product quality, security, or safety issues; allegations of unethical behavior or misconduct or legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate governance issues; data or privacy breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. If we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands and could lead to litigation or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. Damage to our reputation could harm customer relations, reduce demand for our products, reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affect our stock price, and may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming and expensive.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including our priorities for the use of our cash for other purposes, such as capital spending and acquisitions, restrictions under securities laws and the agreements and instruments governing our debt and because of changes in our cash flows, tax laws and the market price of our common stock.\nOur acquisitions and other strategic investments, including our recent acquisition of Active-Semi, could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy and as demonstrated in our recent acquisition of Active-Semi, we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions and strategic investments that could complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities. In the event of future acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies, we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership, incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities. Such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock. Acquisitions and strategic investments also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;\n\u2022\ncontrols, processes, and procedures of an acquired business may not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and we may fail to identify compliance issues or liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs, capital expenditures or working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nacquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees from a company we acquire or in which we invest;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing operations;\n\u2022\ndissynergies or other harm to existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nlosses or impairment of investments from unsuccessful research and development by companies in which we invest;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate acquired businesses, operations, products, technologies and personnel; and\n\u2022\nunrealized expected synergies.\nMoreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations.\nIn order to compete effectively, we must:\n\u2022\nhire and retain qualified employees;\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop leaders for key business units and functions;\n\u2022\nexpand our presence in international locations and adapt to cultural norms of foreign locations; and\n\u2022\ntrain and motivate our employee base.\nOur future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing, R&D and administrative support. We do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees. We must also continue to attract qualified personnel. The competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the number of people with experience, particularly in RF engineering, integrated circuit and filter design, and technical marketing and support, is limited. In addition, existing or new immigration laws, policies or regulations in the U.S. may limit the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, operate as a global company or service our international customer base. Changes in the interpretation and application of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future, which could harm our business and our results of operations.\nWe rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of\nour pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold. Further, we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Our competitors may also be able to design around our patents.\nThe laws of some countries in which our products are developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. This increases the possibility of misappropriation or infringement of our technology and products. Although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Additionally, our competitors may be able to independently develop non-infringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours.\nWe may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Generally, intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material, adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights. Such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation, diverting the attention of management and technical personnel. An unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business, which may include injunctions, exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties. In addition, if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on third-party intellectual property rights, such finding could adversely affect the demand for our products.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our proprietary information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities to provide us with competitive advantages. We protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners and other third parties. We also design our computer networks and implement various procedures to restrict unauthorized access to dissemination of our proprietary information.\nWe face internal and external data security threats. Current, departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to copy, obtain or misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business. Like others, we are also subject to significant system or network disruptions from numerous causes, including computer viruses and other cyber-attacks, facility access issues, new system implementations and energy blackouts.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, phishing, spoofing, and other cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. While we defend against these threats on a daily basis, we do not believe that such attacks to date have caused us any material damage. Because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate, counter or ameliorate all of these techniques. As a result, our and our customers' proprietary information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident, and divert management and other resources. We routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems. We cannot, however, assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber-attack or network disruptions.\nThe costs related to cyber-attacks or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others. Occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts or our IP. Moreover, these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products, product development delays, or diversion of the attention of management and key\ninformation technology and other resources, or otherwise adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price.\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data by or about our employees, customers or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information regarding our employees and others that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, or by our third party service providers, including business process software applications providers and other vendors that have access to sensitive data, could result in damage to our reputation, disruption of our business activities, significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.\nGlobal privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. For example, the European Union has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which requires companies to comply with rules regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged non-compliant activity. Finally, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nWe are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters and our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.\nProduct liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles, and such insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against all claims. If one of our customers recalls a product containing one of our devices, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including replacement costs, direct and indirect product recall-related costs, diversion of technical and other resources and reputational harm. Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest end customers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from sale of the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations and climate change.\nWe are subject to a broad array of U.S. and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those related to the use, transportation, storage, handling, emission, discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing, assembly and testing processes. Our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in:\n\u2022\nregulatory penalties and fines;\n\u2022\nlegal liabilities, including financial responsibility for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated;\n\u2022\nexpenses to secure required permits and governmental approvals;\n\u2022\nreputational damage;\n\u2022\nsuspension or curtailment of our manufacturing, assembly and test processes; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment or to modify our equipment, facilities or manufacturing processes to bring them into compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nExisting and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products. In addition, many of our largest end customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility policies, which often include employment, health, safety, environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements. Compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses, and non-compliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business.\nNew climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or procure substitute raw materials that may cost more or be more difficult to procure. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in increased costs for us and our suppliers. Various jurisdictions are developing other climate change-based regulations that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Future compliance with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nRegulations in the U.S. currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. We may face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deterring, preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of Qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u2022\ngranting to the board of directors sole power to set the number of directors and fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent.\nIn addition, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contains provisions that regulate \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, except under certain circumstances. These provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context, and may also make it more difficult for a third party to\nreplace directors on our board of directors. Further, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur operating results could vary as a result of the methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 of this report). Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations.\nDecisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results.\nFrom time to time, changes in the business environment have led us to change the scope of our operations or business, which has resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges, and this could occur in the future. The amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict. Factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include:\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of plans and programs that are subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate work councils;\n\u2022\nchanges in assumptions related to severance and post-retirement costs;\n\u2022\nthe timing of future divestitures and the amount and type of proceeds realized from such divestitures; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of certain long-lived assets and goodwill.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in China, Germany, Singapore, the U.S. and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in our overall profitability and the amount of profit determined to be earned and taxed in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including those described in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of either our gross deferred tax assets or gross deferred tax liabilities;\n\u2022\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nchanges in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, domestic and foreign, or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and\n\u2022\na future decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.\nChanges in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in Singapore and Costa Rica would have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur subsidiaries in Singapore and Costa Rica have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through December 2021 and March 2024, respectively. In their efforts to deal with budget deficits, governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and, potentially, increased tax rates for corporations. As part of this effort, governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays. In February 2017, Singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from our existing Development and Expansion Incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after June 30, 2021. Future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.\nThe enactment of international or domestic tax legislation, or changes in regulatory guidance, may adversely impact our results of operations.\nCorporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts, and increased tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we have business operations. In 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which included a number of changes to U.S. tax laws that impacted us, including the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the \u201cTransitional Repatriation Tax\u201d) and the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions. In addition, other countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentations rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Legislative changes, interpretations and guidance, and changes in prior tax rulings and decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes resulting from these initiatives, could increase our effective tax rate and result in taxes we previously paid being subject to change, which may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85035, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "QRVO"}
