{"cik": "867374", "company": "ELECTRONICS FOR IMAGING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe market for our super-wide and wide format printers is very competitive.\nThe printing equipment industry is extremely competitive. Our super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet products compete against several companies that market industrial digital inkjet printing systems based on electrostatic, drop-on-demand, and continuous drop-on- demand inkjet, and other technologies and printers utilizing UV curable ink including Agfa, Domino, Durst, Canon, HP, Inca, Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh. Certain competitors have greater resources to develop new products and technologies and market those products, as well as acquire or develop critical components at lower costs, which would provide them with a competitive advantage. They could also exert downward pressure on product pricing to gain market share.\nThe local competitors in the Chinese and Korean markets are developing, manufacturing, and selling inexpensive printers mainly to the local markets. Our ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including the price, performance, and acceptance of our current printers and any products we develop in the future.\nWe also face competition from existing conventional super-wide and wide format digital inkjet printing methods, including screen printing and offset printing. Our competitors could develop new products, with existing or new technology, that could be more competitive in our market than our printers.\nThe market for our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers is very competitive.\nOur Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printer competes with ceramic tile decoration printers manufactured in Spain, Italy, Brazil, China, and smaller emerging competitors in other markets such as\nIndonesia. Competition in the Chinese market consists of small Chinese ceramic tile decoration printers and European manufacturers that are reducing prices to gain market share.\nMost ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printer manufacturers have a background in analog equipment for ceramic tile plants and tile manufacturing facilities, while Durst and Flora entered the ceramic tile decoration market from the digital graphic arts business. Our ceramic tile decoration imaging competitors are a mix of large, medium, and small ceramic tile decoration printer manufacturers, which are primarily privately owned. Nevertheless, our competitors could develop new products, with existing or new technology, that could be more competitive in our market than our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers.\nWe face strong competition for printing supplies such as ink.\nWe compete with independent manufacturers in the ink market.\nOur UV ink is sold to users of our super-wide and wide format UV industrial inkjet printers, which have advanced quality control systems to ensure that correct color and non-expired ink is used to prevent damage to the printer. This results in most ink used in our super-wide and wide format printers being sold by us. While third party ink is available, its use compromises the printer\u2019s quality control system and also voids most provisions of our printer warranty and service contracts.\nNevertheless, we cannot guarantee we will be able to remain the principal ink supplier for our printers. We could experience an overall price reduction within the ink market, which would also adversely affect our gross profit. The loss of ink sales or price reduction in our printer installed base could adversely impact our revenue and gross profit.\nOur solvent-based ceramic digital ink is sold to users of our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers. Until we began formulating our solvent-based ceramic digital ink in our facility in Ypsilanti, Michigan, our customers were required to fulfill their ceramic digital ink requirements from third party suppliers. Although we are focused on developing this recurring revenue stream, we cannot guarantee that we will become the primary supplier of ceramic digital ink to the users of our printers.\nWe face strong competition in our Productivity Software operating segment.\nOur Productivity Software operating segment, which includes our business process automation, cloud-based order entry and order management, cross-media marketing, and imposition solution systems, faces competition from software application vendors that specifically target the printing industry. These vendors are typically small, privately-owned companies. We also face competition from larger vendors that currently offer, or are seeking to develop, business process automation printing products including HP, Epicor, and SAP. We face competition from Oracle, SAP, Solarsoft, and Heidelberg in the packaging software market.\nWe believe the principal competitive factor affecting our markets is the market acceptance rates for new printing technology. There can be no assurance that we will continue to advance our technology and products or compete effectively against other companies\u2019 product offerings.\nWe do not typically have long-term purchase contracts with the printer manufacturer customers that purchase our Fiery DFE and software solutions. They have in the past reduced or ceased, and could at any time in the future reduce or cease, to purchase products from us, thereby harming our operating results and business.\nAlthough end customer and reseller channel preference for Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand, most Fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to design, develop, and integrate Fiery technology into their print engines. We have established direct relationships with several leading printer manufacturers and work closely with them to design, develop, and integrate Fiery DFE and software technology to maximize the\ncapability of their print engines. These manufacturers act as distributors and sell Fiery products to end customers through reseller channels. A significant portion of our revenue is, and has been, generated by sales of our Fiery DFE and software solutions to a relatively small number of leading printer manufacturers. For example, Xerox provided 11% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Because sales of our Fiery products constitute a significant portion of our revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us, we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our Fiery revenue in future periods. Accordingly, if we lose or experience reduced sales to one of these printer manufacturer customers, we will have difficulty replacing that revenue with sales to new or existing customers.\nWith the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations, we typically do not have long-term volume purchase contracts with our significant printer manufacturer customers, including Xerox, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, and Canon, and they are not obligated to purchase products from us. Accordingly, our printer manufacturer customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether. In the past, these printer manufacturer customers have elected to develop products on their own for sale to end customers, incorporated technologies developed by other companies into their products, and have directly sold third party competitive products, rather than rely solely or partially on our products. We expect that these printer manufacturer customers will continue to make such elections in the future.\nMany of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development, quality testing, marketing, and other tasks with these printer manufacturers. We cannot control their development efforts or the timing of these efforts. We rely on these printer manufacturers to develop new printer and copier solutions, applications, and product enhancements that utilize our Fiery DFE technologies and software solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our success in the DFE industry depends on the ability of these printer manufacturers to utilize our technologies to develop the right solutions with the right features to meet ever changing customer requirements and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes.\nBecause our printer manufacturer customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell, any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers or any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general, including reduced end user demand, would likely harm our results of operations. Certain printer manufacturer customers have experienced serious financial difficulties in the past, which led to a decline in sales of our products. If any significant customers face such difficulties in the future, our operating results could be harmed through, among other things, decreased sales volume, write-off of accounts receivable, and write-off of inventories related to products we have manufactured for these customers\u2019 products.\nEntry into new markets or distribution channels could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenue.\nWe continue to explore opportunities to develop or acquire additional product lines in new markets, such as print management business process automation software, document scanning solutions, ceramic tile decoration UV ink, and industrial inkjet printers. We expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services, which will increase our operating expenses.\nWe do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels, or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services, or if we will generate sufficient revenue from these activities to offset the additional operating expenses we incur. Even if we are able to introduce new products or services, if customers do not accept these new products or services, or if we are not able to price such products or services competitively, our results of operations will likely be adversely affected.\nEconomic uncertainty has negatively affected our business in the past and may negatively affect our business in the future.\nOur revenue and profitability depend significantly on the overall demand for information technology products that enable printing of digital data, which in turn depends on a variety of macro- and micro-economic conditions. In addition, revenue growth and profitability in our Industrial Inkjet operating segment depends on demand and spending for advertising and marketing products and programs, which also depends on a variety of macro-and micro-economic conditions.\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions, including Europe, poses a risk as our customers may delay purchases of our products in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, and/or declines in income or asset values. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or terminate their activities have resulted in a tightening in the credit market, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from a credit crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer and distributor insolvencies; increased difficulty in managing inventories; and other financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury operations.\nRecently, economic uncertainty is particularly acute in Europe and especially the \u201csouthern European\u201d countries (i.e., Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece) and in Ireland. We have no European sovereign debt investments. Our European debt and money market investments consist of non-sovereign corporate debt included within money market funds and corporate debt securities of $42.2 million, which represents 16% of our money market funds and corporate debt securities at December 31, 2014. Our European debt investments are with corporations domiciled in the northern and central European countries of Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Norway, France, Belgium, Finland, and the U.K. We do not have any investments in the higher risk \u201csouthern European\u201d countries (i.e., Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy) or in Ireland. We believe that we do not have significant exposure with respect to our money market and corporate debt investments in Europe. Nevertheless, we do have some exposure due to the interdependencies among the European Union countries.\nSince Europe is composed of varied countries and regional economies, our European risk profile is somewhat more diversified due to the varying economic conditions among the countries. Approximately 26% of our receivables are with European customers as of December 31, 2014. Of this amount, 22% of our European receivables (6% of consolidated net receivables) are in the higher risk southern European countries (mostly Spain, Portugal, and Italy), which are adequately reserved. The ongoing relocation of the ceramic tile industry from southern Europe to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia will reduce our exposure to credit risk in southern Europe. Nevertheless, if the ongoing economic uncertainty continues in southern Europe and spreads among all the European Union countries, we may experience difficulty collecting receivables from our European customers.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economies, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated from operations outside the U.S. Approximately $352.0 (45%), $315.6 (43%), and $298.0 (46%) million of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, shipped to locations outside the Americas, primarily to Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and APAC. We expect that sales shipped outside the Americas will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenue. We maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the U.S. Our future revenues, costs, and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in each country\u2019s economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization, and other\nrelated legal matters. If our future revenues, costs, and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Specifically, the slowdown in the Chinese construction market has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our results of operations, specifically within our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printer business. Our revenue in the APAC region, excluding Japan, decreased by 7% during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of this impact.\nWe face risks from currency fluctuations.\nGiven the significance of non-U.S. sales to our total revenue, we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars, we have exposure from non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales (consisting of the Euro, Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar). We have a substantial number of international employees, resulting in material operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We have exposure from non-U.S. dollar-denominated operating expenses in foreign countries (primarily the Euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi, and Australian dollar).\nChanges in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect our consolidated operating expenses and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. We hedge our operating expense exposure in Indian rupees. The notional amount of our Indian rupee cash flow hedge was $2.9 million at December 31, 2014.\nForward contracts not designated as hedging instruments consist of hedges of Brazilian real, British pound sterling, and Euro-denominated intercompany loans with notional amounts of $63.8 million, British pound sterling and Euro-denominated trade receivables with notional amounts of $20.8 million, and Indian rupee net monetary assets with notional amounts of $1.9 million at December 31, 2014.These forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment since there is a natural offset for the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated asset or liability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures, but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies in the future. Our efforts to reduce risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks from our international operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks because of our international operations as follows:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to access cash generated by international operations, especially in China and Brazil, due to restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, distribution of cash to shareholders outside of such countries, foreign exchange control, and other restrictions,\n\u2022\ncustomer credit risk, especially in emerging or economically challenged regions, with accompanying challenges to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise.\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation, including labor regulations, and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals, permits, or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue, business, and operations,\n\u2022\nviolations of governmental regulation, including labor regulations, could result in fines and penalties, including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries, and could materially adversely affect our business,\n\u2022\ninternational labor regulations may be substantially different than the regulations we are accustomed to in the U.S., which may negatively impact labor efficiency and workforce relations,\n\u2022\ntrade legislation in either the U.S. or other countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance laws, or other trade policies, could adversely affect our ability to sell or manufacture in international markets,\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries,\n\u2022\npotential changes in the tax structures of European countries necessitated by the recent global economic downturn, and\n\u2022\nsome of our sales to international customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d) and certain transactions require prior approval of the DOC or other governmental agencies.\nWe incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S. In many foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as outsourced business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, and agents of acquired companies did not take actions in violation of such laws and regulations prior to the date they were acquired by us, although we perform due diligence procedures to endeavor to discover any such actions prior to the acquisition date.\nWe license software used in most of our Fiery products and certain Productivity Software products from Adobe and the loss of these licenses would prevent shipment of these products.\nWe are required to obtain separate licenses from Adobe for the right to use Adobe PostScript\u00ae software in each copier or printer model that uses a Fiery DFE, and other Adobe software for certain Productivity Software products. Although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use Adobe PostScript\u00ae and other Adobe software when required, Adobe is not required to, and we cannot be certain that Adobe will, grant future licenses to Adobe PostScript\u00ae and other Adobe software on reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. To obtain licenses from Adobe, Adobe requires that we obtain quality assurance approvals from them for our products that use Adobe software. Although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurance approvals from Adobe, we cannot be certain they will grant us such approvals in the future. If Adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals, if the Adobe licenses are terminated, or if our relationship is otherwise materially impaired, we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate Adobe PostScript\u00ae or other Adobe software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nWe manufacture our super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers and formulate our ceramic digital ink primarily in single locations. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at these facilities could adversely affect our business.\nOur VUTEk super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are primarily manufactured in a single location in our Meredith, New Hampshire facility. Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Castellon, Spain facility. Our ceramic digital ink that is used in our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers is formulated in a single location in our Ypsilanti, Michigan facility. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at any of these facilities could affect the supply of our product, our ability to meet customer demand, and our ability to maintain market share.\nWe are developing contingency plans utilizing the capabilities of certain contract manufacturers in the event of a significant interruption in the manufacturing process at any of the aforementioned facilities. Until those plans are complete, disruptions in the manufacturing process at any of our sole source internal facilities could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or delays or shortages of supply of these components, could adversely affect our business.\nCertain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. These include CPUs, chip sets, ASICs, and other related semiconductor components; inkjet print heads for our super-wide and wide format, label and packaging, and ceramic tile decoration industrial digital inkjet printers, and certain key ingredients (primarily pigments and photoinitiators) for our digital UV ink. We generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our component suppliers and conduct business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis. If we are unable to continue to procure these sole or limited sourced components from our current suppliers in the required quantities, we will have to qualify other sources, if possible, or redesign our products. If we are unable to obtain the print heads that we currently use, we would be required to redesign our printers to use different print heads. If we are unable to obtain the required pigments, we would need to reformulate our digital UV and ceramic ink and test the new ink formulation. These suppliers may be concentrated within similar industries or geographic locations, which could potentially exacerbate these risks. We cannot provide assurance that other sources of these components exist or will be willing to supply us on reasonable terms or at all, or that we will be able to design around these components. Any unavailability, delays, or shortages of these components or any inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements, could harm our business.\nBecause the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times, in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet demand. Further, as has occurred in the past, in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize, we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete. To meet projected demand, we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent on sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly. As a result, we are subject to risk of inventory obsolescence, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nMarket prices and availability of certain components, particularly memory subsystems and Intel-designed components, which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products, have fluctuated significantly in the past. Such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including reduced gross profit.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors, with whom we do not have long-term contracts, to manufacture and deliver products to our customers. The loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business.\nWe subcontract with other companies to manufacture certain of our products and we generally do not have long-term agreements with these subcontractors. While we closely monitor our subcontractors\u2019 performance, we cannot be assured that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner. In the past, a weakened economy led to the dissolution, bankruptcy, or consolidation of some of our subcontractors, which decreased the available number of subcontractors. If the available number of subcontractors were to decrease in the future, it is possible that we would not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner, or at all, particularly if demand for our products increases.\nThe existence of fewer subcontractors may reduce our negotiating leverage, thereby potentially resulting in higher product costs. Financial problems resulting in the inability of our subcontractors to make or ship our\nproducts, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we change subcontractors, we could experience delays in finding, qualifying, and commencing business with new subcontractors, which would result in delayed delivery of our products and potentially the cancellation of orders for our products.\nWe have outsourced our Fiery production with Avnet, label and packaging digital inkjet printer production with Roberts, and formulation of certain solvent ink with Nazdar. Certain Industrial Inkjet sub-assemblies are manufactured by subcontractors. Should our subcontractors experience any inability, or unwillingness, to manufacture or deliver our products, then our business, financial condition, and operations could be harmed. Since we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our subcontractors, any of our subcontractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit them from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability to fill our orders in a timely manner. In such event, we may not be able to find suitable replacement subcontractors, in which case our financial condition and operations would likely be harmed.\nWe may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence, excess, or shortages related to our Industrial Inkjet printers and ink.\nWe procure raw materials and internally manufacture our super-wide format and ceramic tile decoration industrial digital inkjet printers and formulate digital UV and ceramic digital ink based on our sales forecasts. If we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we may produce or purchase excess inventory, which may result in our inventory becoming obsolete. We might not produce the correct mix of products to match actual demand if our sales forecast is not accurate, resulting in lost sales. If we have excess printers, ink, or other products, we may need to lower prices to stimulate demand.\nOur ink products have a defined shelf life. If we do not sell the ink before the end of its shelf life, it will have to be written off. We have also experienced UV ink shortages in the past and may continue to experience such shortages in the future. UV ink shortages may require that we incur additional costs to respond to increased demand and overcome such shortages.\nIf we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to develop and manufacture products, or meet demand for our products, in a timely fashion.\nWe depend on skilled employees, such as software and hardware engineers, quality assurance engineers, chemists and chemical engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills. We are headquartered in the Silicon Valley and have research and development facilities in 13 U.S. locations. We have research and development facilities in India, Europe, the U.K., Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, China, Australia, and Japan. Competition has historically been intense among companies hiring engineering and technical professionals. In times of professional labor imbalances, it has in the past and is likely in the future, to be difficult to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and to retain these employees. There are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the Silicon Valley and our operations in India that may attempt to hire our employees.\nOur VUTEk printers are manufactured at our Meredith, New Hampshire facility, which is not located in a major metropolitan area. We have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining adequately skilled labor and management at this location.\nThe movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees. If we do not offer competitive compensation, we may not be able to recruit or retain employees, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop products in a timely fashion, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nGrowing market share in the Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet operating segments increases the possibility that we will experience additional bad debt expense.\nThe leading printer manufacturers, which comprise the majority of the customer base in our Fiery operating segment, are typically large profitable customers with little credit risk to us. Our Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet operating segments sell primarily through a direct sales force to a broader base of customers than Fiery. Many of the Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet customers are smaller and potentially less creditworthy. Our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet customer base is primarily located in geographic regions, which have recently been subject to economic challenges including southern Europe (primarily Spain, Italy, and Portugal) and emerging markets in APAC. Furthermore, if we increase the percentage of Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet products that are sold internationally, it may be challenging to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise. Due to these and other factors, growing Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software market share may cause us to experience an increase in bad debt expense.\nAcquisitions may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties assimilating and integrating operations, personnel, technologies, products, and information systems of acquired businesses.\nWe seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources. We have also purchased companies and businesses for the primary purpose of acquiring their customer base. As part of this effort, we have in the past made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of other companies or other companies\u2019 assets.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating operations, employees, technologies, or products, and the required focus of management attention, time, and effort to accomplish successful integration;\n\u2022\nrisk of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience, or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\npossible write-downs of impaired assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration;\n\u2022\npossible restructuring of personnel or leased facilities;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\npossible overruns (compared to expectations) relative to the expense levels and cash outflows of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nadverse reactions by customers, suppliers, or parties transacting business with the acquired company or us;\n\u2022\nrisk of negatively impacting stock analyst ratings;\n\u2022\npotential litigation or any administrative proceedings arising from prior transactions or prior actions of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to protect or secure technology rights;\n\u2022\npossible overruns of direct acquisition and integration costs; and\n\u2022\nif we issue equity securities in connection with any future acquisition, it may be dilutive to our existing stockholders; alternatively, acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash (as was the case with respect to each of our acquisitions during the past three years) will reduce cash reserves.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky. We cannot provide assurance that previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business, operating results, financial condition, or stock price.\nWe face risks relating to the potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.\nWe complete a review of the carrying value of our goodwill and long-lived assets annually and, based on a combination of factors (i.e., triggering events), we may be required to perform an interim analysis.\nGiven the uncertainty of the economic environment and its potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of any economic downturn, or the period or strength of any subsequent recovery, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at December 31, 2014 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units, whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2015 or prior to that, if an interim triggering event has occurred. It is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. No foreshadowing events have occurred as of December 31, 2014.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign employment laws and may face claims in the future under such laws.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign employment laws and from time to time face claims by our employees and former employees under such laws. There are no material claims pending or threatened against us under federal, state, or foreign employment laws, but we cannot be sure that material claims under such laws will not be made in the future against us, nor can we predict the likely impact of any such claims on us, or that, if asserted, we would be able to successfully resolve any such claims without incurring significant expense.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information.\nWe rely on copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret protection, in addition to nondisclosure agreements, licensing, and cross-licensing arrangements to establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which afford only limited protection. We have patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and various foreign countries. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications or from any future applications, or that, if issued, any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results. We cannot be certain that any patents that have been, or may in the future be issued to us, or which we license from third parties, or any other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. In addition, we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents, licenses, or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information.\nMany countries in which we derive revenue do not have comprehensive and highly developed legal systems, particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights, which, among other things, can result in a prevalence of infringing products and counterfeit goods in certain countries, which could harm our business and reputation.\nAs different areas of our business change or mature, from time to time we evaluate our patent portfolio and decide to either pursue or not pursue specific patents and patent applications related to such areas. Choosing not to pursue certain patents, patentable applications, and failing to file applications for potentially patentable inventions, may harm our business by, among other things, enabling our competitors to more effectively compete with us, reducing potential claims we can bring against third parties for patent infringement, and limiting our potential defenses to intellectual property claims brought by third parties.\nLitigation has been, and may continue to be, necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. Such litigation, whether or not concluded successfully, could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation.\nThird parties have claimed in the past, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe, or may infringe, their proprietary rights. Such claims have resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation in the past and could have a similar result in the future. Such claims and any related litigation, whether or not we are successful in the litigation, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we cannot assure that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be subject to risk of loss due to fire because certain materials we use in our ink formulation process are flammable.\nWe use flammable materials in the digital UV and ceramic digital ink formulation process; therefore, we may be subject to risk of loss resulting from fire. The risk of fire associated with these materials cannot be completely eliminated. We own certain facilities that manufacture or warehouse our ink, which increases our exposure to such risk. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses caused by fire, including business interruption insurance. If one or more of these facilities is damaged or otherwise ceases operations as a result of fire, it would reduce our digital UV and ceramic ink manufacturing capacity, which may reduce revenue and adversely affect our business.\nThe location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to risk of earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters.\nOur corporate headquarters, including a significant portion of our research and development facilities, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is known for seismic activity. This area has also experienced flooding in the past. Many of the components necessary for our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas that are subject to risk from natural disasters including the San Francisco Bay Area, Taiwan, and Japan.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood, tsunami, hurricane, typhoon, or other business interruptions due, for example, to power shortages and other interruptions could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may be subject to environmental-related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents.\nOur business operations involve the use of certain hazardous materials at three locations. At these facilities, we formulate and store UV, ceramic, solvent, thermoforming, and dye sublimation ink. The formulation and storage of solvent ink and ceramic ink requires the use of solvents. Our formulation of solvent ink is limited as we have primarily outsourced solvent ink formulation. However, we launched internal formulation and marketing of ceramic solvent-based ink during 2014 at our facility in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The solvents used in ceramic ink formulation have low volatility by design. As a result, ceramic ink poses less environmental risk compared with true solvent inks.\nThe hazardous materials and solvents that we use are subject to various governmental regulations relating to their transfer, handling, packaging, use, and disposal. We store ink at warehouses world-wide, including Europe and the U.S., and shipping companies distribute ink at our direction. We face potential liability for problems such as large spills or fires that may arise at ink manufacturing locations. While we customarily obtain insurance coverage typical for this kind of risk, such insurance may not be sufficient. If we fail to comply with these laws or an accident involving our ink waste or chemicals occurs, or if our insurance coverage is not sufficient, then our business and financial results could be harmed.\nFuture sales of our hardware products could be limited if we do not comply with current and future environmental and chemical content regulation in electrical and electronic equipment.\nWe believe that our products are currently compliant with RoHS, WEEE, REACH, and other regulations for the European Union as well as with China RoHS and other applicable international, U.S., state, and local environmental regulations. We monitor environmental compliance regulations to ensure that our products are fully compliant prior to the implementation of any potential new requirements. However, new unforeseen legislation could require us to re-engineer our products, complete costly analyses, or perform supplier surveys, which could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. We could also incur additional costs, sanctions, and liabilities in connection with non-compliant product recalls, regulatory fines, and exclusion of non-compliant products from certain markets.\nOur products may contain defects, which are not discovered until after shipping, which could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves.\nOur products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others, which may contain undetected defects. We have in the past discovered software and hardware defects in certain of our products after their introduction, resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such defects or, in certain circumstances, replacing the defective product, which may damage our relationships with our customers. Defects could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipment and any such defects could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenue. Defects in our products (including defects in licensed third party software) detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and the incurrence of additional expense, which could harm our operating results. We generally provide a twelve month hardware limited warranty from date of shipment for certain Industrial Inkjet printer and Fiery DFE products, which may cover both parts and labor.\nOur standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions, including but not limited to alteration, modification, misuse, mishandling, and storage or operation in improper environments. While we recorded an accrual of $9.7 million at December 31, 2014, for estimated warranty costs that are estimable and probable, based on historical experience, we may incur additional costs of revenue and operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect adequately the cost to resolve or repair defects in our products or if our liability limitations are declared enforceable, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenue.\nMaintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us. There are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Although we take preventive measures to protect our products, and we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events, these procedures may not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, reduce or delay future purchases, or purchase competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures to protect their computer systems from attack, which could delay or reduce purchases of our products. Any of these actions or responses by customers could adversely affect our revenue.\nSystem failures, or system unavailability, could harm our business.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, internal technology systems, and internal and external websites for our development, marketing, operational, support, and sales activities. Our hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from malicious code released into the internet through vulnerabilities in popular software programs. These systems are also subject to acts of vandalism and potential disruption by actions or inactions of third parties. Any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a low of $36.62 to a high of $47.75. We expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nability to initiate or complete stock repurchase programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products or services by our competitors or by us;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to strategic relationships, acquisitions, or investments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nany failure to meet security analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the securities analysts\u2019 rating of our securities;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and the affects of military engagements or natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncommencement of litigation or adverse results of pending litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial performance and/or market valuations of other software and high technology companies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions.\nBecause of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading price of our securities could decline as a result. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies, impacted by the continuing uncertainty in our economy. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate volatility.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of fixed income debt securities classified as available-for-sale securities. As a result, our investment portfolio is subject to counterparty risk and volatility if market interest rates fluctuate.\nWe attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years; however, we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations. This may cause volatility in our investment portfolio value.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical and dental coverage. Our self-insurance reserves may not be adequate to cover our medical and dental claim liabilities.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical and dental coverage, excluding employees covered by health maintenance organizations. We generally have an individual stop loss deductible of $125 thousand per enrollee unless specific exposures are separately insured. We have accrued a contingent liability of $1.4 million as of December 31, 2014, which is not discounted, based upon examination of historical trends, historical actuarial analysis, our claims experience, total plan enrollment (including employee\ncontributions), population demographics, and other various estimates. Although we do not expect that we will ultimately pay claims significantly different from our estimates, self-insurance reserves, net income, and cash flows could be materially affected if future claims experience differs significantly from our historical trends and assumptions.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility.\nIn November 2013, our board of directors authorized $200 million for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. This authorization expires in November 2016. Any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility. There can be no assurance that repurchases will be made at the best possible price. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, but are not necessarily limited to, the amount and timing of future stock repurchases and the origin of funds used for such repurchases. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time. Any such suspension could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nOur profitability may be affected by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign countries. Intercompany transaction pricing can impact our tax liabilities. We are potentially subject to tax audits in various countries and tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatments, including intercompany pricing or other matters, and assess additional taxes. We regularly review the likely outcomes of these audits to determine whether our tax provisions are sufficient. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the final assessments of these audits can have a material impact on our net income.\nOur effective tax rate in the future may be impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and new information discovered during the preparation of our tax returns. U.S. and foreign tax legislative initiatives, such as proposals for fundamental tax reform in the United States or multi-jurisdictional actions to address \u201cbase erosion and profit-shifting\u201d by multinational companies, could adversely affect our effective tax rate, if enacted. Any of these changes could negatively impact our net income.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (\u201cNotes\u201d) in cash, repay the Notes at maturity, or repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change.\nIn September 2014, we completed a private placement of $345 million principal amount of Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in Note 7-Convertible Senior Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make conversion payments in cash, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion, as described in Note 7-Convertible Senior Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted or at their maturity.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash (such as the Notes) could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, requires us to separately account for the liability and equity components of the Notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects our non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the Notes is included in additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to recognize non-cash interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in current and future periods as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their principal amount over their term. We will report lower net income because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the original issue discount and the Notes\u2019 non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Notes.\nUnder certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method. The effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess were issued, if we elected to settle such excess in shares. We cannot be sure that accounting standards will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method in the future. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nCertain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and under Delaware law could delay or impair a change in control.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows the board of directors to issue preferred stock, which may include powers, preferences, privileges, and other rights superior to our common stock, thereby limiting our stockholders\u2019 ability to transfer their shares and may affect the price they are able to obtain. Our amended and restated bylaws do not allow stockholders to call special meetings and include, among other things, procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, which may have the effect of delaying or impairing attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control or hostile takeovers of the Company.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain\nsignificant stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of delaying or impairing the removal or replacement of management, proxy contests, or changes in control. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that has the effect of delaying or impairing a change in control of the Company could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that certain investors may be willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77971, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "EFII"}
