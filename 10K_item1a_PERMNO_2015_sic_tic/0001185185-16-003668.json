{"cik": "1001463", "company": "Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion with respect to our consolidated financial statements although our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles, assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.\nInherent risks currently exist in this industry as a result of the determination by many nationally-chartered banks that they would be operating outside the federal laws by accepting deposits from cannabis oil producers. Many states have legalized the growing, production, sale, and consumption of various cannabis related products, but the federal government has continued to take the position that such activities are not legal. However, the federal government has taken the posture for years that it will defer to the states in those matters insofar as certain products, such as those containing a high concentration of THC, are not transported across state lines. While the federal government has generally turned a blind eye to these matters in favor of state legislation, it nonetheless sends confusing signals to the industry. As such, many nationally-chartered banks fear prosecution under money-laundering or other statutes, relegating some businesses to maintain large sums of cash on hand, even meeting payrolls and accounts payable obligations with cash rather than checks. As a result, those businesses are placed at high risk of internal and external theft and crimes relating to the lack of controls and security afforded by transactional banking. The Company is currently utilizing credit unions for its deposit needs, but this still creates risks when the proceeds at diverse production locations , often themselves in cash due to the same issues, cannot be deposited in nearby accessible depositories. The Company has acquired an armored vehicle for use in the transport of cash and cannabis products, but believes those risks will not be minimized until national depository institutions allow cannabis-related businesses to utilize their facilities.\nBecause We Have Limited Operating History, it is Difficult to Evaluate Our Business.\nOn January 15, 2016 the Company acquired certain assets that it will utilize in revenue-producing operations under two new operating subsidiaries related to the medical cannabis industry. As a result of our limited operating history in those businesses, you have very little operating and financial data about us upon which to base an evaluation. You should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties we may encounter, including those frequently encountered by new companies. If we are unable to execute our plans and grow our business, either as a result of the risks identified in this section or for any other reason, this failure would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects, and financial condition.\nThe medical cannabis industry faces very uncertain regulation in the light of the continuing deregulation of cannabis products in many states, either as high-CBD/low-THC products, or as high-THC products, but the continuing regulation of the cannabis industry by the federal government. While the federal government has for several years chosen to not intervene in the cannabis business conducted legally within the states that have legislated such activities, there is nonetheless the potential that the federal government may at any time chose to begin enforcing its rules against the manufacturing, possession, or use of cannabis-based products. Similarly, there is the possibility that the federal government may enact legislation or rules that authorize the manufacturing, possession or use of those products under specific guidelines. In the event the federal government were to tighten its regulation of the industry, the Company would likely suffer substantial losses. In the event the federal government were to loosen or change its rules or laws in favor of the industry, the Company would have an opportunity to benefit substantially if it were properly positioned to take advantage of the new opportunities.\nAs such, the purchase of our securities is a purchase of an interest in what should be considered as a high risk venture or in a new or \u201cstart-up\u201d venture with all the unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and difficulties to which such ventures are subject.\nWe plan to grow through acquisitions\nWe plan to grow through expansion of our new operations, creation of new businesses, acquisitions, and/or mergers, and investors have little current basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target businesses' operations or our ability to identify and integrate acquired operations into our company. Because we intend to develop and expand our business at least in part through selective acquisitions of or mergers with other businesses, there are significant risks that we may not be successful. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional companies or assets or successfully integrate such additional companies or assets into our Company without substantial costs, delays or other problems. In addition, companies we may acquire may not be profitable at the time of their acquisition or may not achieve levels of profitability that would justify our investment. Acquisitions may involve a number of special risks, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nadverse short-term effects on our reported operating results,\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management's attention,\n\u00b7\ndependence hiring, training, and retaining key personnel,\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities,\n\u00b7\namortization of acquired intangible assets, some or all of which could reflect poorly on our operating results and financial reports,\n\u00b7\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies; and,\n\u00b7\nincursion of debt to make acquisitions or for other operating uses.\nTo the extent we complete a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.\nWe will seek to implement our acquisition strategy in certain industries that may have unknown risks due to governmental regulation\nThe medical cannabis industry faces very uncertain regulation in the light of the continuing deregulation of cannabis products in many states, either as high-CBD/low-THC products, or as high-THC products, but the continuing regulation of the cannabis industry by the federal government. While the federal government has for several years chosen to not intervene in the cannabis business conducted legally within the states that have legislated such activities, there is nonetheless the potential that the federal government may at any time chose to begin enforcing its rules against the manufacturing, possession, or use of cannabis-based products.\nInherent risks currently exist in this industry as a result of the determination by many nationally-chartered banks that they would be operating outside the federal laws by accepting deposits from cannabis oil producers. Governmental regulation in this area may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, or may eliminate this barrier to normalization of the capital controls function.\nWe may acquire a business in what may be considered a mature industry in which single-digit or low double-digit growth may occur. Most growth for our Company would, accordingly, occur largely through acquisitions. To the extent that competitors are also seeking to grow through acquisitions, we could encounter competition for those acquisitions or a generally increasing price to acquire going concerns.\nA primary part of the Company\u2019s strategy is to establish revenue through the acquisition of or merger with additional companies or operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, combine with, or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate the operations of additional companies into those of the Company without encountering substantial costs, delays or other problems. In addition, there can be no assurance that companies acquired in the future will achieve or maintain profitability that justify liabilities that could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial condition. The Company may compete for acquisition, merger, and expansion opportunities with companies that have greater resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or merger candidates will be available, that purchase terms or financing for acquisitions or mergers will be obtainable on terms acceptable to the Company, that acquisitions or mergers can be consummated, or that acquired businesses can be integrated successfully and profitability into the Company\u2019s operations. Further, the Company's results of operations in fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition or merger could be materially adversely affected while the Company integrates the acquired business into its existing structure.\nThe Company will attempt to acquire or merge with business entities that are going and functioning concerns with a trailing history of profitability, but may acquire or merge with certain businesses that have either been unprofitable, have had inconsistent profitability prior to their acquisition or combination therewith, or that have had no operating history. An inability of the Company to improve the profitability of these acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Finally, the Company's acquisition and merger strategy places significant demands on the Company's resources and there can be no assurance that the Company's management and operational systems and structure can be expanded to effectively support the Company's acquisition strategy. If the Company is unable to successfully implement its acquisition and merger strategy, this inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, or financial condition. The Company may face the opportunity to enhance shareholder value by being acquired by another company. Upon any acquisition of the Company, the Company would be subject to various risks, including the replacement of its management by persons currently unknown. There can also be no assurance that, if acquired, new management will be successfully integrated or can profitably manage the Company. In addition, any acquisition or merger of or by the Company may involve immediate dilution to existing shareholders of the Company. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to or desire to be acquired, or be able to acquire or merge with additional companies.\nNeed for Additional Financing\nThe Company does not have adequate capital or resources to fund its operations and other capital needs for the next six months without new and expanding revenue sources or additional capital infusion, and there can be no assurance that such funds will become available in amounts sufficient to meet the obligations of our business. The Company may require additional amounts of capital for its future expansion and working capital, possibly from private placements of its common stock or borrowing, but there can be no assurance that such financing will be available, or that such financing will be available on acceptable terms.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our Chief Executive Officer, Richard K. Pertile. The loss of Mr. Pertile\u2019s services could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company does not presently maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Pertile, but may obtain such insurance at the discretion of its board of directors for such term as it may deem suitable or desirable. Our future success may depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. The competition for such personnel can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we can attract, assimilate or retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel for favorable compensations in the future.\nTechnological Change\nTechnology, particularly the ability to (i) stay abreast of and ahead of current production oil extraction technologies; (ii) successfully create and promote new products related to our industry; (iii) continue to take a leading role in maintenance and distribution of our planned GeoTraking technology as it relates to RFID tracking from seed to sale, HIPAA compliance across the board including in its proprietary PoS systems, and otherwise; and (iv) use the Internet to conduct business and allow several management functions, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service announcements, introductions and enhancements, and changing customer demands. Our future success will to some degree depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, our ability to adapt its solutions to meet evolving industry standards and our ability to improve continually the performance, features and reliability of its solutions. Similarly, the Company must also continue to examine new processes and technologies related to its new citrus byproducts subsidiary. The failure of the Company to adapt successfully to such changes in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful implementation of solutions, or that any new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions will adequately meet the requirements of its current and prospective customers and achieve any degree of significant market acceptance. If the Company is unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if its solutions or enhancements do not achieve a significant degree of market acceptance, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition\nAny industry served by the Company is likely to be highly competitive across the entire United States and the rest of the world. In particular, the cannabis industry, being the impetus of all the Company\u2019s attention at this juncture, is very highly competitive and has drawn thousands of competing entities. While the Company believes its technology, programs, and plans place it in a posture to compete at the highest levels, the sheer numbers of competitors must be recognized. The Company has elected to devote the majority of its efforts on production and sales of its products and services within the continental United States, but may institute operations in diverse countries. Even so, the Company must be considered as currently competing with other companies in diverse countries than can potentially produce and sell competitive products at lower prices. While the Company believes that there are other hurdles for those foreign entities to overcome, including the high cost of international shipping to U.S. buyers, we believe that they nonetheless can compete with us in our markets. We will potentially compete with a variety of companies, both domestic and international, and as such will be subject to various levels of competition. There is no assurance the Company will be able to adhere to its plans or to engage in any acquisitions or mergers at all. The Company will consider fielding opportunities to buy, sell or distribute its products in other countries.\nControl\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors owns or controls a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions.\nAs of January 15, 2016, in subsequent actions related to the acquisition of assets of the MariJ Group of companies by the Company, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Richard K. Pertile, was issued 1,014,000 new Common shares of the Company in exchange for his interests in the acquired entities. In addition, he was granted, from the CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Company until that date, Steven L. Sample, the right of first refusal to purchase 2,500,000 shares of Mr. Sample\u2019s Common stock of the Company in a window between April 4 and May 4, 2019, and was also given a proxy to vote those shares in the interim. As such, following those transactions, Mr. Pertile owned 6.57% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock and controlled through the proxy 2,500,000 additional votes, or 16.20% of the total issued and outstanding voting power of the Company for a combined 3,514,000 votes, or 22.77% of the total. As a result, he currently possesses significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions. His effective control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. As of the same date, Mr. Sample, the outgoing CEO and Chairman of the Company, continued to control the dispositive voting power of his remaining personal shares of the Company, after accounting for those votes given to Mr. Pertile by proxy, of 3,015,479 shares, or 19.54% of all issued and outstanding votes of the Company. In the event Mr. Sample were to combine his votes on any issue with the votes held by Mr. Pertile, they would jointly possess 42.31% of the voting power of the Company, allowing them significant influence that could elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions. As of that same date, all officers and directors of the Company owned a combined total 6,809,979 shares representing 44.26% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock and voting power. Based upon the Company's current business plan, it is anticipated that Mr. Pertile will continue to have substantial influence over, if not effective control over the Company\u2019s operations in the near future, including the election of a majority of its board of directors, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities, and other matters of corporate governance, perhaps even after some potential subsequent issuances by the Company of new common shares for capital raising activities, acquisitions, or merger activities.\nWe may, in the future, issue additional shares of common stock, which would reduce investors\u2019 percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of 150,000,000 shares of common stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.\nManagement of Growth\nThe Company is continually seeking to identify and acquire viable businesses. As a result, the Company must manage relationships with a growing number of third parties as it seeks to accommodate this goal. The Company's management, personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the Company\u2019s future operations. The Company's ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operating and financial procedures and controls, to replace or upgrade its operational, financial and management information systems and to attract, train, motivate, manage and retain key employees. If the Company's executives are unable to manage growth effectively, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If successful in acquiring or combining with other operations, the Company anticipates it may inherit a substantial portion of the staff necessary to operate the new entities, but there is no assurance that will happen, or that if it does happen, that the staff will remain employed by the Company for any period of time. We may find that some of the personnel and management of any acquisition target(s) may not be suitable for continued employment, while other suitable candidates may elect to discontinue their employment or affiliation with the Company for various reasons. This can create a burden on the Company\u2019s management as it seeks to fill key positions. Failure of the Company to do so in a timely manner can result in disruption of operations, loss of revenues, and an attendant reduction in profits or even substantial losses.\nRisks Associated with Expansion\nThe Company desires to start, acquire or combine with other businesses, perhaps in diverse locations and markets. To date, the Company does not have substantial experience in developing services on a regional or national scale. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to deploy successfully its goods or services in those markets. There are certain risks inherent in doing business in several diverse markets, such as; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, potentially adverse tax consequences, local restrictions, controls relating to inter-company communications and technology, difficulties in staffing and managing distant operations, fluctuations in manpower availability, effects of local competition, weather and climactic trends, and customer preferences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the success of the Company's operations and, consequently, on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nProduct and Service Offerings\nOn January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the assets and related businesses of the MariJ Group of companies consisting of four (4) entities, and intends to conduct its future business operations through two (2) newly-created wholly-owned subsidiaries utilizing the majority of those assets. The four acquired entities include:\nMariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOn January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the assets and business of MariJ Agricultural, Inc., a Florida corporation. Those assets and business were placed into the Company\u2019s new subsidiary named MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cMariJ\u201d). While that entity had only began revenue-producing operations in Q4 of 2015, it is anticipated to expand its operations and revenues substantially in 2016 as an Acacia subsidiary following planned capital expansion based on success in raising the funding necessary to fuel those plans.\nMariJ\u2019s impetus will in the extraction and processing of very high quality, high-CBD/low-THC content medical grade cannabis oils from medical hemp plants. MariJ specializes on organic strains of the plant, setting itself apart from the general producers of non-organic products. In addition, MariJ has the technical expertise and capability to process and formulate the oils and to employ them in its compounding operations. MariJ will seek to become engaged as owner or co-owner of a grow facility in Florida or other location(s) such as to produce its own plants for processing. MariJ has also been preparing for the 2016 rollout of its newly-developed, proprietary Geotraking Technology that is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability standard (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) utilizing its \u201cplant to patient\u201d solution. This Geotraking Technology is designed to provide a full-channel patient care tracking system that is fully compliant under today\u2019s strict HIPAA regulations that require privacy and security of the patient\u2019s information. Beginning with RFID labeling and tracking of every single seed employed in the grow program and continuing through the sale of prescription products in a sophisticated retail PoS delivery system, the GeoTraking Technology will be the most advanced system available.\nMariJ\u2019s revenues are anticipated to be generated from several activities, including but not limited to the following:\na.\nCannabis oil extraction and processing. MariJ has a unique mobile cannabis oil processing and extraction unit designed into a heavy-duty vehicle. That unit has already begun performing extractions and processing of medical hemp oils at various sites, and is currently developing additional contracts for services.\nb.\nWholesale sale of raw and processed medical cannabis oils.\nc.\nLaboratory testing and certification services. MariJ has begun construction of a mobile laboratory and testing unit, also on a heavy-duty truck chassis, intended to address the growing demand for these services in the medical cannabis industry.\nd.\nLicensing and support of the Company\u2019s GeoTraking Technology systems\ne.\nProcessing and compounding services for medical grade cannabis oils\nThe Company is preparing to seek additional investments and financing to pay the costs of building its second mobile oil extraction and processing unit, to finance final construction of its mobile laboratory and testing unit for the same industry, and to complete the roll-out of its GeoTraking Technology system. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in its plans to generate the required capital.\nCanna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc.\nThe Company acquired the assets and the business of Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, LLC, a Florida organization, on January 15, 2016. The Company intends to utilize this new subsidiary to engage in research and development activities as well as retail and wholesale distribution of medical cannabis products and dietary supplements, depending upon our ability to comply in each instance with FDA rules and other regulations. As a part of its R&D efforts, the new subsidiary will seek to align itself with institutions of higher learning in working to develop new products and to identify and develop additional uses for its medical cannabis products.\nWhile this subsidiary has not yet implemented revenue-producing operations, it is anticipated to begin generating revenues after mid-2016. Those revenues will be generated from several activities, including the following:\na.\nCanna-Cures will seek to enter into research and development projects with institutions of higher learning in efforts to develop new and better strains of medical cannabis related products for dispensing as medications, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and probably dietary supplements. Canna-Cures anticipates participating in state and federal grants in conjunction with one or more universities as a means to defray part of its costs in these efforts.\nb.\nPrivate label packaging services. The Company has obtained a majority of the equipment required to engage in the business of packaging and labeling of medical cannabis oils, oil-infused products, and related items.\nc.\nRetail sales of medical cannabis oils, oil-infused products, and other merchandise through its web-based portal or retail dispensaries planned for that purpose. These activities are dependent in large part upon meeting FDA regulations and criteria relating to the sale and distribution of cannabis-infused products, and the Company is currently in the process of determining the status of those criteria.\nd.\nRetail and wholesale sales of cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and dietary supplements containing its high-quality cannabis oil extracts, again dependent upon the same FDA regulations and criteria as mentioned in item (c) above.\nThe Company will require additional capital to finalize these plans and accommodate the roll-out of its services for this subsidiary, and intends to begin its capital raising activities within the next 60 to 90 days or less. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in its plans to generate that capital.\nJR Cannabis Industries, LLC\nThe third entity acquired in the transactions of January 15, 2016 was JR Cannabis Industries, LLC. That entity was a service business providing management services in coordination with the activities of MariJ Agricultural. Following the acquisition of those entities, Acacia determined that it no longer needed services the same of r similar to those of JR Cannabis Industries, and therefore has elected to recreate it as a subsidiary of the Company.\nTropiFlora, LLC\nThe fourth and final entity acquired in the transactions of January 15, 2016 was TropiFlora, LLC\nIn the acquisition transactions of January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the non-capital assets and the business of TropiFlora, LLC, but not the goodwill or the capital assets of TropiFlora, as a part of its efforts to engage growing cannabis in Florida. Prior to TropiFlora\u2019s acquisition by MariJ, and ultimately by Acacia, it was a grower with decades of experience in the nursery industry with the capacity to grow large quantities of plants. MariJ and subsequently Acacia acquired the business of TropiFlora to position itself to be issued a Growers License under the new 2015 Florida cannabis laws. If successful in obtaining a Florida Growers License, TropiFlora, as an Acacia subsidiary, would cultivate and distribute legal medical cannabis products in the state, opening the door to the sale of the non-euphoric strains of cannabis to treat patients with seizure disorders and cancer. However, the State of Florida announced the names of the five applicants that were to be awarded the Growers Licenses, but TropiFlora was not among the winners. Substantial legal objections have arisen as to the Florida license award process, prompting the filing of a number of complaints and spawning litigation with the State. The Company believes that, among other things, TropiFlora was unfairly judged for the licensing opportunity. The legal complaints instituted by TropiFlora while a part of the MariJ Group of companies and before its acquisition by Acacia left many questions that can only be answered as the cases progress through the administrative and judicial systems. As a result of the fact that substantial sums would be required to pursue the reversal of the perceived errors in the licensing process, the Company believes it is not in its best interests to continue on that course. Accordingly, the Company has therefore determined to exercise its option to rescind the TropiFlora acquisition under the certain specific terms and conditions agreed prior to its acquisition. Thus, the Company will take no action to create or operate a subsidiary utilizing the acquired TropiFlora assets.\nAs such, the Company intends to instead seek one or more other potential new licensing opportunities within Florida in conjunction with the anticipation of future license offerings, or to seek licensing opportunities in other states.\nThe Company may seek to start, acquire, or combine with other service or non-service entities, including those involved in manufacturing, transportation, distribution, chemical products, or otherwise. It is important to our future success to expand the breadth and depth of our offerings to be competitive and to enhance our potentials for growth of revenues and profits. Expansion of our categories and offerings in this manner will require significant additional expenditures and could strain our management, financial and operational resources. For example, we may find it prudent to acquire or build, outfit, and operate a new manufacturing facility or to initiate a new transport subsidiary where one is not currently available. We cannot be certain that we would be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner or that we would be able to offer certain products or services in demand by our customers, or to do so in a quality manner. Furthermore, any new product or service offering that is not favorably received by the Company\u2019s clients could damage our reputation. The lack of market acceptance of new products or services or our inability to generate satisfactory revenues from expanded product or service offerings to offset their costs could harm our business. If we do not successfully expand our sales operations, our revenues may fall below expectations. If we do not successfully expand our operations on an ongoing basis to accommodate increases in demand, we will not be able to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner, which would harm our business. Most of our product or service operations are anticipated to be handled at our facilities, but some services may be performed at offsite locations or by approved vendors or contractors. Any future expansion may cause disruptions in our business and may be insufficient to meet our ongoing requirements. The Company may move into various businesses as sales, manufacturing, transport, marketing, or otherwise, and is not limited to considering only product or service business offering. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying new businesses, or if it can be successful in acquiring or merging with any new business if identified.\nGovernment Regulation and Legal Uncertainties\nAny new legislation or regulation, or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to the Company's business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCheck, Credit Card, and Other Fraud\nOur business could be harmed if we experience significant credit, wire transfer, draft, check, credit card, or other fraud. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent transactions, our revenues and results of operations could be harmed. The Company may attempt to obtain insurance as partial protections from such potential losses, but even while the Company\u2019s exposure to loss in this event may be limited by the purchase of any such insurance, losses could nonetheless occur. Any losses sustained as a result of fraud or fraudulent activity would adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations, and its financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nLiability Claims\nThe Company may face costly liability claims by consumers or other businesses. Any claim of liability by a client, employee, consumer or other entity against us, regardless of merit, could be costly financially and could divert the attention of our management. It could also create negative publicity, which would harm our business. Although we maintain certain forms of liability insurance, it may not provide protections in the event of certain liability claims, or may not be sufficient to cover a covered claim if one is made.\nThe Company may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable.\nThe Company has limited capital resources. Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern, the Company may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations.\nOur lack of history in our current industry makes evaluating our business difficult.\nWe have a limited operating history in our current industry and we may not sustain profitability in the future.\nTo sustain profitability, we must:\n\u00b7\ndevelop and identify new clients in need of our product;\n\u00b7\neconomically increase production output;\n\u00b7\ncompete with larger, more established competitors in our industry;\n\u00b7\nmaintain and enhance our brand recognition; and\n\u00b7\nadapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments.\nWe may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives. Further, our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development, particularly companies in highly competitive industries. The historical information in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance. For example, we expect that our future annual growth rate in revenues will be moderate and likely be less than the growth rates experienced in the early part of our history.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, brand and reputation, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may experience a rapid growth in operations, which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively identify, integrate, develop and motivate new employees, and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. To attract top talent, we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages. The risks of over-hiring or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability.\nAdditionally, if we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, brand and reputation, results of operations and financial condition. If operational, technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. This will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers. These system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses.\nWe may be subject to regulatory inquiries, claims, suits, or prosecutions which may impact our profitability.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions. We can give no assurance that we will prevail in such regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Responding to, defending and/or settling regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions may be time-consuming and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business. A negative outcome in any of these proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services, potential liabilities or additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nExpanding our product offerings or number of offices may not be profitable.\nWe may choose to develop new products to offer. Developing new offerings involves inherent risks, including:\n\u00b7\nour inability to estimate demand for the new offerings;\n\u00b7\nour inability to perfect the new products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to locate and identify new buyers for those products;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from more established market participants; and\n\u00b7\na lack of market understanding.\nIn addition, expanding into new geographic areas and/or expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market.\nRisks of Low Priced Stocks\nFollowing its initial public offering of its common stock in 1996, the Company\u2019s shares were originally traded on the NASDAQ Exchange into 2000 as Gibbs Construction, Inc. under the trading symbol GBSE. Gibbs encountered severe financial difficulties in 2000, after which it was moved from the NASDAQ Capital Markets to the OTC Pink Sheets. Following the resurrection of the Company\u2019s operations in 2007 through the intervention and assistance of the Company\u2019s CEO, Mr. Sample, its stock currently trades on the OTCQB exchange under the trading symbol ACCA. Most of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common shares continue to be restricted shares resulting in a small \u201cfloat\u201d. For that and other reasons the Company\u2019s securities have been thinly traded, and while a trading market for the Company's common stock could develop further with its current or new operations and the further release of restrictions on registered shares, there can be no assurance that it will do so.\nFollowing the acquisition of the MariJ Group of companies on January 15, 2016 the Company saw immediate and continuing increased activity in the trading of its stock, with trading volumes exceeding any for at least the past ten years.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) has adopted regulations which define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security, such as those of the Company, that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. In the event the Company determined to offer its common stock for sale, or elected to utilize its common stock in an acquisition of merger transaction, it would be required to advise the potential purchasers or parties to any such acquisition or merger transaction of the risks of penny stocks. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock by a retail customer, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange commission relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Accordingly, market makers may be less inclined to participate in marketing the Company\u2019s securities, which may have an adverse impact upon the liquidity of the Company\u2019s securities.\nIf the Company were successful in identifying a new business opportunity and/or identifying an acquisition or merger target, became successful in actually launching a new business or acquiring or merging with any such target, and was successful in bringing profitable operations to the Company, it would intend to seek to meet the new listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital market and attempt to return to that Exchange, which listing requirements include minimal capitalization, share price, and other benchmark requirements. There is no assurance the Company can successfully identify any suitable new business opportunity, acquisition or merger candidate, or if successful in identifying a new business opportunity or merger/acquisition candidate, that it can be successful in developing a new business or completing any acquisition or merger, or if successful in developing a new business or completing any acquisition or merger that the Company could be successful in meeting the new listing requirements of the NASDAQ, or if successful in meeting those requirements, that the NASDAQ would accept the Company as a member, or that if the Company were successful in achieving a listing on the NASDAQ exchange that its share values would improve. Any attempt to return to the NASDAQ Exchange, even if the Company were successful in meeting the requirements to do so, could take as long as two years or more to complete.\nWe are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called \u201cpenny stocks\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. Our common stock is therefore considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, and we are subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the \u201cPenny Stock Rule\u201d. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nNo Assurance of Payment of Dividends\nShould the Company acquire additional operations, and should the operations of the Company become profitable, it is likely that the Company would retain much or all of its earnings in order to finance future growth and expansion. Therefore, the Company does not presently intend to pay dividends, and it is not likely that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.\nPotential Future Capital Needs\nThe Company may not be successful in generating sufficient cash from its new operations or in raising capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms to meet its capital needs. The failure to generate sufficient cash flows or to raise sufficient funds may require the Company to delay or abandon some or all of its development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities, and may make it difficult for the Company to respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. While the Company may seek to raise capital through the offering of common stock, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so, or if successful in raising capital that the proceeds in any such offering will be sufficient to permit the Company to implement its proposed business plan, or that any assumptions relating to the implementation of such plan will prove to be accurate. To the extent that the proceeds of any such offering are not sufficient to enable the Company to generate sufficient revenues or achieve profitable operations, the inability to obtain additional financing will have a material adverse effect on the Company. There can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that the Company will be successful in finding new operations.\nImplementation of Business Plan\nThe Company currently does not have sufficient working capital to pursue our business plan in its entirety as described herein. Our ability to implement our business plan will depend on our ability to obtain sufficient working capital and to execute its business plans. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain additional capital, or, if available, that such capital will be available at terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate profit from operations, or if profits are generated, that they will be sufficient to carry out our business plans, or that the plans will not be modified.", "PERMNO": 82822, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACCA"}
