{"cik": "1024628", "company": "ZAP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to obtain adequate working capital from Chinese banks to finance the manufacturing of the products ordered by the dealers, Jonway may not be able to meet delivery commitments and would have to refund deposits made by dealers that have placed orders and paid down payments.\nZAP Jonway has been experiencing a shortage of working capital, and has continued to manage cash flow by delaying delivery of products that have been ordered and has received portions of the payments. Jonway has relied on a revolving credit line from the Chinese banks, but with the banks reducing the credit availability, Jonway may not be able to meet delivery commitment dates which would result in order cancellation and shrinkage of backlog. This may reduce dealership confidence in the Jonway and their interest to continue to market and sell the products.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to raise additional funding to support the on-going capital investment needed to produce new models and stay competitive in the automobile market, then this would erode the competitiveness of its products.\nZAP Jonway has been trying to raise funding to support on-going product development and next generation new models in order to stay competitive. To remain competitive, ZAP Jonway has to launch new models every 18 months in order to keep up with market trends and technology advancements. Inability to raise adequate funding would reduce the ability of ZAP Jonway to produce new models of its products.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to find the bank financing needed by the dealerships in China to support the dealers\u2019 show room and stock their warehouse inventory, then dealers may decide to choose other products to sell in their dealerships, and the lack of stock in the warehouse also may deter interest by the dealers to continue promoting the products.\nDue to the tight bank credits available to small businesses, many dealers now are in need of the automobile companies to provide financing and guarantees in order to fund the showroom stock and the warehouse. Without the financing support, many dealers may not be able to continue selling our products.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to adequately fund marketing and sales in order to establish and strengthen our sales network, product brand and promote the Company\u2019s products, then ZAP Jonway may be limiting the growth of the revenues and the expansion of the business.\nZAP Jonway may not be able to adequately fund marketing and sales, and thereby limiting the exposure needed to promote the products and bring market awareness of its product line. This would limit the growth and expansion of the overall business.\nIf ZAP Jonway does not maintain proper disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWhile the audit of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm has included a consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis of designing audit procedures, our independent registered public accounting firm has not considered internal controls over financial reporting for the purpose of expressing an opinion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If such an evaluation had been performed, material weaknesses or other control deficiencies may have been identified. In addition, material weaknesses and other control deficiencies may be identified when our management performs evaluations of internal controls in the future. Ensuring that ZAP has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that allows us to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is costly and time-consuming, and we are required to evaluate these controls frequently.\nZAP has a history of losses and ZAP Jonway\u2019s future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis is uncertain, which could have a harmful effect on ZAP Jonway\u2019s business and the value of ZAP\u2019s common stock.\nZAP incurred net losses attributable to ZAP of $17.6 million; $15.0 million and $21.8 million, for years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively and has had net losses in each quarter since its inception. Jonway incurred net losses of $13.9 million, $ 14.2 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Jonway has outstanding short term loans in total of US$9.8 million as of December 2014 with multiple Chinese banks, and the collateral used for the loan has used up all of Jonway Auto\u2019s factory building and land. This loan has been used to finance Jonway\u2019s losses over the last few years. Additionally outstanding notes payable amounts to $17.7 million as of December 2014. Due to the slow down of the economy of China, Chinese banks have reduced the credit line available to small and medium size businesses in order to increase their credit reserves, anticipating the continuing down turn in the economy. Jonway\u2019s short term loan with Taizhou was recently reduced by US $1 milion which has created a credit crunch for the company. Despite orders in the pipeline for both the SUV and minivan, Jonway without adequate working capital, has not been able to keep up with manufacturing the products to meet the delivery. Jonway anticipates that the other short term loans that remain may also be reduced which will further negatively impact the working capital.\nZAP Jonway believes that it may continue to incur operating and net losses for our gasoline and electric vehicles until at least the time ZAP Jonway begins significant volume deliveries of the new models of Jonway\u2019s electric vehicle models, and when the international sales of the EVs picks up volume. We expect to begin international sales of the electric vehicles in limited quantities for key countries in 2015. However, due to the uncertainty of type approval processes in different countries, this international sales volume and the EV sales may be delayed in some of the countries if the testing process requires substantial investment and corrective changes to the vehicles. Even if we are able to successfully obtain type approvals in all the required countries for the electric vehicle models, there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful as it depends on market adoption of full electric vehicles in the sales regions that ZAP Jonway targeted. Our profitability will be dependent upon the successful development of new and additional sales EV dealership networks and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of our electric vehicles models, which may not reach our targeted volumes to achieve profitability this year. Gross margins were low in 2014 due to the low volume and the competitive pricing of new competitors into the SUV markets in China. The unexpectedly low of economic growth in China in 2014 also affected the sales of vehicle. The reduction of bank credit has reduced the financial support needed by dealers to grow their business, place larger orders and continue to expand market and sell the products. Increased cost in sales and marketing also contributed to increased operating costs, which increased the net loss of the overall business. The rising RMB has created challenges in competitiveness of the Chinese products internationally, as a result, the gross margins of international sales also suffered as a result of the RMB float.\nZAP Jonway expects the rate at which we will incur losses to continue in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u00b7\nBuild the new EV dealership networks in China\n\u00b7\nincrease our business development and manufacturing activities for the new van model and electric vehicles in China;\n\u00b7\nbegin international business development, marketing and sales which requires expensive type approval testing\n\u00b7\ndevelop international semi-knock down kit (SKD) manufacturing activities that may be required in some of the countries to attain favorable import tax rates;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to design, develop new models to keep up with demands of the market and compete against new models from competitors and manufacture our follow on planned new gas and electric vehicles;\n\u00b7\nbolstering our after-sale services network especially internationally;\n\u00b7\nbuild inventories of parts and components for our new gas and electric vehicles;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and equip manufacturing facilities to produce our new gas and electric vehicle models;\n\u00b7\nexpand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;\n\u00b7\nincrease our sales and marketing activities to support new models promotion;\n\u00b7\nincrease our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations; and\n.\nOverall rising RMB is likely to continue which will increase the cost of operations in China.\nBecause ZAP Jonway will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive substantial incremental revenues to offset the operational costs with respect thereto, ZAP Jonway\u2019s losses in future periods will likely to continue to incur. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipated or that these efforts may not result in increases in our revenues, which could further increase ZAP Jonway\u2019s losses.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk of your investment.\nYou must consider the risks and difficulties we face as a company with a limited operating history. If ZAP Jonway does not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. ZAP was formed in September 1994, but only began manufacturing electric automobiles in 2006. ZAP Jonway\u2019s net losses attributable to ZAP were; $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. ZAP acquired 51% of the equity shares of Jonway in January 2011. ZAP Jonway as a combined Company has a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, operating results and prospects. To date, ZAP has derived revenues principally from sales of customized versions of our standard vehicles, and to a lesser extent on consumer products. Jonway has derived revenues principally from sales of its conventional fuel SUVs. ZAP Jonway intends in the foreseeable future to derive a significant portion of its revenues from the sales of our planned electric and the main 1.5L gasoline SUV product. ZAP Jonway has no operating history with respect to its newer vehicles, which limits our ability to accurately forecast the cost of supporting the sales and customer service of the vehicles.\nIt is difficult to predict ZAP Jonway\u2019s future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business, and what competition will likely introduced in the electric vehicle space. Despite wide interests in the major targeted countries, USA and China, in electric vehicles, the competition in this space is growing, with many new models offering plug-in hybrids which pose a more durable range compared to the full electric vehicles that ZAP Jonway plans to offer in its product plans.\nZAP\u2019s primary revenue, sales and manufacturing is from Jonway Auto, based in China and Jonway\u2019s sales revenues are mostly in China currently, and subject to the market conditions, economy, as well as regulations of the Chinese government.\nMost of ZAP Jonway\u2019s revenues and sales, as well as manufacturing production operations are in China, and is subject to the market and economic conditions as well as government regulations in China. Over the years, the Chinese government regulations and policies have tended to have very direct impact on the development of specific industry sectors, whether this is in the form of restrictions, or in the form of incentives and credit availability. Many smaller dealerships were unable to continue to get bank lines to support inventory purchases and display new products on their show room floors. This credit tightening by the Chinese government on the banks will continue this year. ZAP Jonway has replaced the smaller dealers with dealers that have a stronger financial backing in larger cities, in anticipation that bank credits will not loosen up much this year.\nAutomobile manufacturing is a strictly regulated industry and ZAP Jonway uses the valuable auto license granted from a subsidiary of its holding group Jonway Group that holds the UFO license (issued in Hangzhou). Regulations, policies and incentives from central and provincial government vary over time and could hinder or help the overall ZAP Jonway sales in China. This is especially the case with electric vehicles where the government has put forth incentives from both central and selective large provincial and city governments. These incentives which are substantial could be eliminated without warning and any business plans that rely on these incentives to succeed would be vulnerable to being severely impacted.\nThe Chinese government is exercising precaution in managing the economic growth of China. The GDP forecast for China for this year and the subsequent years will be lower than prior years, as the government puts control on escalating property value, restrictions on issuing licenses for new constructions and as well as restricting licenses for new auto ownerships in the major cities, in order to reduce traffic on the road for these large cities. However, the government has waived controls on full electric vehicles and also in some cities waived the auto license fees for EVs, which in Shanghai and Beijing can be as high as $7,000 or more. These incentives could be removed any time without warning and EVs would then be subject to the same dis-incentives as traditional gasoline vehicles.\nDue to the continued losses incurred by both ZAP and Jonway Auto, Jonway Auto has been borrowing money from Chinese banks using the land and buildings from its factory in Sanmen. These loans are used for both working capital as well as supplementing the losses over the last few years. Currently all of its land and building has been used as collateral against the loans made by Jonway Automobile in order to fund the losses incurred over the last couple of years.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Jonway Auto has outstanding loans of approximately $9.8 million and bank acceptance notes of approximately $17.7 million to support the losses incurred and $69.5 million in deficit working capital. These loans and bank acceptance notes are from multiple Chinese commercial banks. Interest rates for these loans range from 5% to 9% per annum and continue to be a burden on the profitability of the company.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business and fluctuations in our operating costs.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our gas and electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry in general, and for electric vehicles in particular, typically decline over the winter season in the United States, while sales are generally higher as compared to the winter season during the spring and summer months. In China, sales declined over the spring, first quarter of the year due to holidays during Chinese New Year and summer months and were higher in the autumn and winter seasons, fourth quarter of the year due to promotions and year-end inventory clearance sales. ZAP Jonway expects sales of our vehicles to fluctuate on a seasonal basis and dependent on the country where the sales originated. However, ZAP Jonway\u2019s limited operating history and its early entry into the international markets makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles. ZAP Jonway\u2019s operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our variable sales and marketing expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue.\nZAP Jonway also expects our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture our planned vehicles, build and equip new manufacturing facilities to produce them, type approval both in China and international for the new models, incur costs for spare parts provisioning, warranty repairs or product recalls, if any, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.\nAs a result of these factors, ZAP Jonway believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful until there is more history built up of the combined companies\u2019 performance and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, ZAP Jonway\u2019s operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors that may compare the results to established auto companies, since ZAP Jonway is in the early stages of building its business in the electric vehicle space, leveraging on the experience and resources available from its sales and manufacturing of gasoline vehicle business. If this occurs, the trading price of ZAP\u2019s common stock could vary substantially depending on the results of the new business developments.\nThe future growth of our electric vehicle business is dependent upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include:\n\u00b7\nperceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles;\n\u00b7\nperceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology, including vehicle electronics and regenerative braking systems, such as the possible perception that Toyota\u2019s recent vehicle recalls may be attributable to these systems;\n\u00b7\nthe limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;\n\u00b7\nthe decline of an electric vehicle\u2019s range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge;\n\u00b7\nConcerns about electric grid capacity and reliability, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a practical solution to vehicles which require gasoline;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;\n\u00b7\nimprovements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of service for electric vehicles;\n\u00b7\nthe environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u00b7\nvolatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u00b7\nconsumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u00b7\naccess to charging stations, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost of charging an electric vehicle;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;\n\u00b7\nperceptions about and the actual overall cost of electric vehicles; and\n\u00b7\nmacroeconomic factors.\nIn addition, recent reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles. To the extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain widespread acceptance, ZAP Jonway\u2019s ability to market and sell our vehicles, particularly in colder climates, may be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, ZAP Jonway may become subject to regulations that may require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles. For example, ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. We are aware of advocacy groups, such as the United States National Federation of the Blind, which are lobbying for regulations to require electric vehicle manufacturers to adopt minimum sound standards.\nThe influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles, which would materially adversely affect ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position.\nZAP Jonway may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in ZAP Jonway\u2019s competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. ZAP Jonway\u2019s research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if ZAP Jonway is not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not manufacture engines, which make us dependent upon other suppliers of engine technology for our vehicles.\nManufacturing internationally may cause problems and present risks for ZAP Jonway.\nZAP Jonway has been focusing on manufacturing internationally, particularly in China. There are many risks associated with international business. These risks include, but are not limited to, language barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic instability, regulatory compliance difficulties, problems enforcing agreements, and greater exposure of ZAP Jonway\u2019s intellectual property to markets where a high probability of unlawful appropriation may occur. A failure to successfully mitigate any of these potential risks could damage our business.\nZAP Jonway is required to comply with all applicable domestic and foreign export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR. Some items manufactured by us are controlled for export by the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR. In addition, ZAP Jonway is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international counterparts that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts for foreign governments and officials. Violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including large monetary penalties and suspension or debarment from participation in future government contracts, which could reduce ZAP Jonway\u2019s future revenue and net income.\nBecause ZAP Jonway manufactures and sell a substantial portion of our products abroad, its operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the foreign currencies in which we denominate certain of our trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and other expenses, the U.S. dollar equivalent of such expenses would increase. We can provide no assurances that we will not experience losses arising from currency fluctuations in the future, which could be significant.\nThe range of ZAP\u2019s electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time, which may negatively influence potential customers\u2019 decisions whether to purchase our vehicles.\nThe range of ZAP electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. For example, a customer\u2019s use of their ZAP vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge. Battery deterioration and the related decrease in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles.\nDevelopments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways ZAP Jonway does not currently anticipate. For example, fuel which is abundant and relatively inexpensive in North America, such as compressed natural gas may emerge as consumers\u2019 preferred alternative to petroleum based propulsion. Any failure by ZAP Jonway to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s future success will depend upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models.\nZAP anticipates that a substantial amount of its revenue in the future will be generated from the sale of its electric vehicles. Jonway currently generates a substantial amount of its revenue from the sale of its gas fueled vehicles. Of ZAP Jonway\u2019s planned vehicles, our electric vehicles, such as the Alias, electric A380 SUV and the improved gas fueled vehicle models are expected to be in production in 2015. All of our planned products require significant investment prior to commercial introduction, and may never be successfully developed or commercially successful. There can be no assurance that ZAP Jonway will be able to design future models of electric or gas vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future model will become commercially viable. Additionally, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, ZAP Jonway may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology. To date ZAP Jonway has limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing and selling our vehicles.\nAny changes to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s electric vehicle range testing procedure or the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s energy consumption regulations for electric vehicles could result in a reduction to the advertised range of ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles which could negatively impact our sales and harm our business.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requires us to calculate and display the range of ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles sold in the United States on a label we affix to the vehicle\u2019s window. The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers, or SAE, which further requires that we test vehicles sold in the United States using the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s, or the EPA\u2019s, combined city and highway testing cycles. The EPA recently announced that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles. However, there can be no assurance that the modified EPA testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction. Any reduction in the advertised range of ZAP Jonway vehicles could negatively impact our vehicle sales and harm our business.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to reduce and adequately control the costs associated with operating our business, including our costs of manufacturing, sales and materials, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects will suffer.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to reduce and/or maintain a sufficiently low level of costs for designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing and servicing our vehicles relative to their selling prices, our operating results, gross margins, business and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant investments for the design, manufacture and sales of our vehicles. There can be no assurances that our costs of producing and delivering our vehicles will be less than the revenue we generate from sales at the time of the launch of such vehicle or that we will ever achieve a positive gross margin on sales of any specific vehicle.\nZAP Jonway incurs significant costs related to contracting for the manufacture of our vehicles, procuring the materials required to manufacture our electric cars, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. Although we expect manufacturing expenses to proportionally decrease with the localization of manufacturing in Jonway\u2019s facilities, if ZAP Jonway is unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. Many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells used in our vehicles could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased materials costs to us.\nThe automotive market is highly competitive and ZAP Jonway may not be successful in competing in this industry. ZAP Jonway currently faces competition from established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future.\nThe worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and ZAP Jonway expects it will become even more so in the future. ZAP Jonway currently faces strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of all-electric vehicles such as the Nissan LEAF, Tesla, Ford, Volkswagen, Chevy Volt, Renault and many others.\nMost of ZAP Jonway\u2019s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our incumbent competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively.\nFurthermore, certain large manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles at a substantial discount, provided that the vehicles are financed through their affiliated financing company. ZAP Jonway does not currently offer or plan to offer, any form of direct financing on our vehicles. ZAP Jonway has not in the past, and does not currently nor in the foreseeable future intend to, offer substantial customary discounts on our vehicles. The lack of direct financing options and the absence of substantial customary vehicle discounts could put ZAP Jonway at a competitive disadvantage.\nZAP Jonway expects competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for conventional and alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. ZAP Jonway\u2019s ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that ZAP Jonway will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, ZAP Jonway may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nDemand in the automobile industry is highly volatile.\nVolatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a newer automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, ZAP Jonway has less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we sell our vehicles will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers.\nDifficult economic conditions may affect consumer purchases, such as ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles.\nOver the last three years, the deterioration in the global financial markets and continued challenging condition of the macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our vehicles. The Chinese economy is slowing down, and due to government regulation that restricts the purchase of vehicles for major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing due to massive congestion and pollution problems, the demand for automobiles may decline. Despite strong incentives from government to promote the adoption of EVs by subsidies and lifting restrictions to waive EV purchases, consumers\u2019 reluctance may continue to persist due to the lack of charging infrastructures and consumers\u2019 concern with the reliability and safety of EVs. Difficult economic conditions could therefore temporarily reduce the market for vehicles in ZAP Jonway\u2019s price range. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors, including changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit.\nIf the current difficult economic environment improvement is transient, we may experience a decline in the demand for new vehicles and thus ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles as well, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Accordingly, any events that have a negative effect on the United States or China\u2019s economy or on other foreign economies or that negatively affect consumer confidence in the economy, including disruptions in credit and stock markets, and actual or perceived economic slowdowns, may harm ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nMarketplace confidence in our liquidity and long-term business prospects is important for building and maintaining ZAP Jonway\u2019s business.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to establish and maintain confidence about ZAP Jonway\u2019s liquidity and business prospects among consumers and within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results and business prospects may suffer materially. ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from now, buyers of ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with ZAP Jonway if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. If ZAP Jonway is required to downsize in the future, such actions may result in negative perceptions regarding our liquidity and long-term business prospects.\nAccordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, ZAP Jonway must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more established auto makers, we believe that, in ZAP Jonway\u2019s case, the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following:\n\u00b7\nZAP Jonway\u2019s limited operating history;\n\u00b7\nZAP limited revenues and lack of profitability to date;\nJonway Auto\u2019s outstanding loan and line of credit for working capital;\n\u00b7\nunfamiliarity with or uncertainty about our electric vehicles;\nlack of infrastructure to support the refueling/recharging of EV and new energy vehicles;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty about the long-term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles generally, or electric vehicles specifically;\n\u00b7\nthe prospect that ZAP Jonway may need ongoing infusions of external capital to fund our planned operations;\n\u00b7\nthe size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe prospect or actual emergence of direct, sustained competitive pressure from more established auto makers.\nMany of these factors are largely outside of ZAP Jonway\u2019s control, and any negative perceptions about our liquidity or long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed.\nZAP Jonway may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, ZAP Jonway\u2019s operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\nThe design, manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2014, ZAP Jonway incurred net losses of approximately $24.3 million and used approximately $0.4 million of cash in operations while recognizing approximately $28.7 million in revenue. As of December 31, 2014, ZAP Jonway had cash and cash equivalents of $0.24 million. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to ZAP Jonway on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Future issuance of ZAP equity or equity-related securities will dilute the ownership interest of existing ZAP shareholders and our issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of our company. Jonway Auto\u2019s cash flow depends heavily on continuing orders from its domestic and international markets, and using the payments to finance the bulk of the required working capital to deliver the products in order to fulfill the sales orders. If the future orders were to slow down, or get substantially reduced, ZAP and Jonway Auto would need more funding to support its cash flow in order to make payment to its suppliers and meet its working capital cash needs.\nIf ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles fail to perform as expected, we may have to recall our products and our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. ZAP has received an order from Department of Transportation (DOT) in the U.S. to recall its 2008 Xebra vehicles with buy back because the proposed fix submitted in 2012 was not acceptable to DOT. ZAP has discontinued the sale of Xebras since 2011 and also issued recall notices last year with respect to the 2008 Xebra\u00ae model. This recall is due to the 2008 Xebras inability to meet the braking distance requirements when the vehicle is operating at its maximum speed. On November 14, 2012, NHTSA determined that ZAP has not reasonably met its recall remedy and notification requirements and ordered ZAP to take specified actions to meet its requirements. ZAP\u2019s recall includes 627 units sold in U.S. market. ZAP and the United States reached a settlement that is incorporated into a Consent Decree that was entered and approved by the U.S. District Court on July 17, 2013. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, ZAP agreed to initiate a buy-back program whereby it would offer to provide a refund of $3,100 to each eligible MY 2008 ZAP Xebra owner. ZAP began repurchasing vehicles in March, 2014. As of Dcember 31, 2014 ZAP had received 316 eligible refund requests,\nAs for other models, while we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the performance of our vehicles, particularly our electric vehicles, in the hands of our customers. While it has not initiated any product recalls to date, Jonway has had a relatively short operating history and there can be no assurances that Jonway will not be required to recall products in the future. There can be no assurance that ZAP Jonway will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. In the future, ZAP Jonway may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our vehicles or their components prove to be defective. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which would adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers\u2019 expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market. Any product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to ZAP Jonway\u2019s brand and reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nZAP Jonway has very limited experience servicing our vehicles and ZAP Jonway is using a different service model in the US through third party service contracts with US partners. If ZAP Jonway is unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we anticipate the level and quality of the service we provide our customers will have a direct impact on the success of our future vehicles. If ZAP Jonway is unable to satisfactorily service our current customers, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be impaired.\nZAP Jonway plans to service our vehicles by shipping parts to dealers, sending our authorized service personnel as necessary, providing service at our Santa Rosa location and arranging to have local US partners take up the service contracts with new vehicles delivered in the US supported by Jonway\u2019s service personnel in China. ZAP Jonway\u2019s customer service centers are distributed all over China and are trained to provide local support within their territories. We are adopting similar models internationally where ZAP will sign up local in-country partners who have presence in the major cities to provide customer service support, and provide these partners with service training and spare parts. Jonway\u2019s service facilities in China are not yet equipped to handle ZAP Jonway electric vehicles and will have to be updated and the personnel trained for this purpose. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or ZAP Jonway\u2019s limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet this service requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles ZAP Jonway is able to deliver annually increases.\nA number of potential customers may choose not to purchase ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers\u2019 service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nTraditional automobile manufacturers do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. ZAP does not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and has not yet established US dealership network. It is unclear when such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles. As our vehicles are placed in more locations, ZAP\u2019s may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects.\nIn addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many jurisdictions require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the jurisdiction. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which ZAP Jonway has no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our service practices would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. If issues arise in connection with these regulations, certain aspects of our service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law, which may require additional investment and affect the efficiencies and operations of our business processes.\nZAP Jonway may not succeed in continuing to establish, maintain and strengthen the ZAP and Jonway brands, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects.\nOur business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the ZAP and Jonway brands. Any failure to develop, maintain and strengthen our brands may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our existing and planned vehicles. If ZAP Jonway does not continue to establish, maintain and strengthen our brands, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brands will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide quality vehicles and maintenance and repair services, and we have limited experience in these areas, which are through third party arrangements. Jonway\u2019s service facilities in China are not yet equipped to handle ZAP electric vehicles and will have to be updated and the personnel trained for this purpose. In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the ZAP and Jonway brands will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. To date, Jonway has limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brands and Jonway has relied primarily on its distribution network. To further promote our brands, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening the ZAP and Jonway brands. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain strong brands, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.\nZAP Jonway is dependent on our suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our vehicles at prices and volumes acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results.\nWhile ZAP obtains components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. We refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our single source suppliers.\nWhile ZAP believes that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while ZAP believes that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for almost all of our single sourced components on a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our electric vehicles may be time consuming and costly.\nJonway obtains most of its components, such as its engines, from multiple third party suppliers, except for interior trim plastic components, which it obtains from Jonway Group.\nChanges in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond ZAP Jonway\u2019s control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace our existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to ZAP Jonway\u2019s customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of materials, in particular lithium-ion cells, could harm ZAP Jonway\u2019s business.\nZAP Jonway may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials. Any such cost increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. ZAP Jonway uses various materials in our business and the prices for these materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, ZAP Jonway is exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for batteries, particularly lithium-ion cells for our electric vehicles. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nthe inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;\n\u00b7\nDisruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and\n\u00b7\nAn increase in the cost of raw materials, such as cobalt, used in lithium-ion cells.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles. Battery cell manufacturers may have additional restrictions and constraints placed by local regulatory government agencies that may affect their ability to continue to supply lithium batteries for electric vehicle manufacturers in the event that they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. Furthermore, current fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our materials would increase our bill of materials and operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of materials by increasing vehicle prices and any attempts to increase the announced or expected prices in response to increased material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers and could materially adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results.\nThe success of our electric vehicle business depends on attracting and retaining large fleet customers. If ZAP Jonway is unable to do so, we will not be able to achieve profitability.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicle business\u2019 success depends on attracting large fleet or taxi customers to purchase our electric vehicles. If our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our vehicles and services to be of sufficiently high value and quality, cost competitive and high performing, ZAP Jonway may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers, and our business and prospects, operating results and financial condition would suffer as a result. To date, we have limited experience selling ZAP Jonway vehicles and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining large fleet or taxi customers. If for any of these reasons ZAP Jonway is not able to attract and maintain customers, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s plan to expand our network of distributors will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s plan to expand our network of distributors will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our vehicles. This planned global expansion of distributors may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree ZAP Jonway is anticipating. We will also need to ensure ZAP Jonway is in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale of our vehicles in our potential markets, which could take considerable time and expense. If ZAP Jonway experiences any delays in expanding our network of distributors, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We may not be able to expand our network at our expected rate and our planned expansion of our network of distributors will require significant cash investment and management resources.\nFurthermore, certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements, franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions. Any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results.\nZAP Jonway faces risks associated with our international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business.\nZAP Jonway faces risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. Recently, in China, rising wages in China have increased operating costs and the rising RMB exchange rate is reducing the price competitiveness of our vehicles internationally. All of this is putting pressure on the operating costs of manufacturing plants. Meanwhile, due to numerous labor disputes in large manufacturing plants, local government regulatory authorities and labor union advocates have increased their scrutiny of wages, labor conditions in China. To the extent such developments result in more burdensome labor laws and regulations or require us to increase the wages of employees, ZAP Jonway\u2019s ability to adequately staff our plants and to manufacture and ship products in China could be adversely affected, our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a reliable supplier could be negatively impacted.\nZAP currently has international operations and subsidiaries in China, and is evaluating setting up assembly plants in strategic countries where local partners are willing to invest in the production assembly plants in order to improve tax rates. Jonway is developing international distribution activities in Brazil, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, Ghana and Thailand. In the near future, Jonway intends to add other new international distribution to Southeast Asia, the Middle East and South America depending on the opportunities and strengths of the local interested partners. Additionally, as part of ZAP Jonway\u2019s growth strategy, we intend to expand our sales, maintenance and repair services internationally. However, we have limited experience to date in manufacturing, selling, and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures, including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities, in advance of generating any revenue. ZAP Jonway is subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u00b7\ncompliance of ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles to various international regulatory requirements where our vehicles are sold, or homologation;\n\u00b7\nlabor unrest and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7\nexcess costs associated with reducing employment or shutting down facilities;\n\u00b7\nconstraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices as the RMB rises and still remain competitive;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating communications among and managing international operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in marketing and attracting customers in new jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon ZAP in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to ZAP in the United States;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake; our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan and European countries, which increases the risk of unauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technology;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in obtaining or complying with export license requirements;\n\u00b7\nUnited States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nforeign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;\n\u00b7\npreferences of foreign nations for domestically owned companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and\n\u00b7\nthe strength of international economies.\nZAP Jonway also faces the risk that costs denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar. If the value of the United States dollar depreciates significantly against such currencies, our costs as measured in United States dollars will correspondingly increase and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, our battery cell purchases from international suppliers are subject to currency risk. Although ZAP present contracts are United States dollar based, if the United States dollar depreciates significantly against the local currency it could cause our international suppliers to significantly raise their prices, which could harm ZAP Jonway\u2019s financial results.\nTo respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, ZAP Jonway may further expand internationally in lower cost locations. As we pursue continued expansion in these locations, we may incur additional capital expenditures. In addition, the cost structure in certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop or as such countries join multinational economic communities or organizations, causing local wages to rise. As a result, we may need to continue to seek new locations with lower costs and the employee and infrastructure base to support our international operation. We cannot assure you that ZAP Jonway will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of our international operations or that our international operations will contribute positively to our operating results.\nIf ZAP Jonway fails to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nSome of the laws and regulations governing Jonway are vague and subject to risks of interpretation.\nSome of the laws and regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China governing our business operations in China are vague and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations governing Jonway\u2019s business, required licenses and approvals, and the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. We believe that we comply with regulatory requirements in the People\u2019s Republic of China, but there can be no certainty that government will not have a different interpretation. Despite their uncertainty, Jonway will be required to comply. In particular, Jonway\u2019s regulatory authority to manufacture vehicles is through Zhejiang UFO\u2019s listing on the Public Notice. We believe this satisfies regulatory requirements, but if the government decides otherwise, they could enforce penalties and fees and require Jonway to obtain a separate listing on the Public Notice. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed businesses may be applied retroactively. Accordingly, the effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may not be clear. ZAP Jonway cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new laws or regulations may have on our business. If any promulgated regulations contain clauses that cause an adverse impact to ZAP Jonway\u2019s operations in China, then our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nJonway\u2019s contracts are based in the Chinese Renminbi, which may fluctuate against the U.S. dollar and must be reconciled into the U.S. dollar for ZAP Jonway\u2019s consolidated financials.\nJonway\u2019s present contracts are based in the Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d), except for international trading contracts in the US dollar. The value of the RMB depends, to a large extent, on China\u2019s domestic and international economic, financial and political developments and government policies, as well as the currency\u2019s supply and demand in the local and international markets. Over the last two years, the value of the RMB largely appreciated against U.S. dollar and will continue to appreciate over time. There can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not fluctuate widely against the U.S. dollar in the future. Fluctuation of the value of the RMB will have adverse effects in reconciling Jonway\u2019s financial statements into the U.S. dollar in consolidated financials and such reconciliation may require significant resources of ZAP Jonway and therefore cause an adverse effect on ZAP Jonway\u2019s business. Additionally, the rising RMB could increasingly reduce the price competitiveness of our products internationally outside of China, and add to the overall manufacturing costs for each vehicle.\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAny reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and electric vehicles specifically. If we fail to meet conditions for tax incentives for electric vehicles, we would be unable to take full advantage of these tax incentives and our financial position could be harmed.\nIn addition, certain regulations that encourage sales of electric cars could be reduced, eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect for ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, while the federal and state governments in the United States have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars, our competitors have more experience and greater resources in working with legislators than we do, and so there is no guarantee that our vehicles would be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future. This would put ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, low volume manufacturers are exempt from certain regulatory requirements in the United States. This provides ZAP Jonway with an advantage over high volume manufacturers that must comply with such regulations. Once we reach a certain threshold number of sales in the United States, we will no longer be able to take advantage of such exemptions in the respective jurisdictions, which could lead us to incur additional design and manufacturing expense.\nJonway depends in part on government subsidies and economic incentives to finance Jonway\u2019s independent research and development, production and sale, such as a Chinese surtax exemption, technology innovation incentives and land use rights investment subsidies from local government. The related government subsidies and incentives amounted to $0.33 million and $0.24 million for Jonway in 2014 and 2013, respectively. If government policies change, or if Jonway otherwise fails to obtain these incentives, it will adversely affect ZAP Jonway\u2019s financial position and operating results. Due to lack of a business license, Jonway cannot obtain certain government grants for the auto manufacturing industry, or other incentives, such as the enterprise income tax preferential treatment, and other incentives for auto manufacturers.\nZAP\u2019s payment in its common stock in the US to compensate for services rendered by service providers and some employees may put downward pressure on stock prices.\nZAP in the US had paid some of its employees and contractors with stock and this continues to put pressure on the share price. ZAP is putting more restrain on the issuance of stock for services, and minimized the issuance of stock options to employees.\nZAP\u2019s efforts to integrate acquired businesses, especially Jonway, into our existing operation may not be successful.\nZAP Jonway may, in the future, continue to acquire businesses in China and in other jurisdictions that we believe would benefit us in terms of product diversification, brand enhancement, technological advances, geographical presence or expansion of sales and distribution networks. Our ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable targets and to obtain any necessary financing for such acquisitions. In order to complete certain acquisitions, we may require regulatory approvals or other conditions to closing that delay the completing of strategic transactions beyond the time anticipated. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired business, its personnel or its products into our existing business, particularly:\n\u00b7\nallocating management resources;\n\u00b7\nscaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites;\n\u00b7\nseparating operations or support infrastructure for entities divested;\n\u00b7\nmanaging and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and terminating unfavorable relationships;\n\u00b7\nintegrating the acquired company\u2019s systems into our management information systems;\n\u00b7\nsatisfying unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, which could require the expenditure of material amounts of cash;\n\u00b7\noperating in the geographic market or industry sector of the business acquired in which we may have little or no experience;\n\u00b7\nimproving and expanding our management information systems to accommodate expanded operations; and losing key employees of acquired operations\nThese difficulties may result in delays or failures in realizing the benefits of the acquired business or its products, diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns and, higher costs of integration than we anticipated. In addition, we may also face cultural and other issues integrating businesses in China and other jurisdictions, including oversight to ensure these businesses comply with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, particularly regarding compliance with the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. ZAP Jonway may be ineffective in fully adopting more efficient systems for timely recording and reporting to provide transparency and accuracy of all operations and finances. Delayed adoption of tracking systems may affect the performance of the Company.\nZAP Jonway may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.\nStrategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of ZAP Jonway\u2019s business. There are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationship opportunities in the future or our competitors may capitalize on such opportunities before we do. We may not be able to offer competitive benefits to other companies that we would like to establish and maintain strategic relationships with which could impair our ability to establish such relationships. Moreover, identifying such opportunities could demand substantial management time and resources, and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties. If ZAP Jonway is unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nZAP Jonway may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting non-strategic assets, which could cause our financial results to fail to meet our forecasts.\nFrom time to time, ZAP Jonway may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end-customer markets, to obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies, to enter new geographic manufacturing locations, to lower our manufacturing costs and improve the margins on our product mix, and to further develop existing customer relationships. Strategic transactions involve many difficulties and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u00b7\nintegrating acquired operations and businesses;\n\u00b7\nregulatory approvals or other conditions to closing that delay the completing of strategic transactions beyond the time anticipated;\n\u00b7\nallocating management resources;\n\u00b7\nscaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites;\n\u00b7\nseparating operations or support infrastructure for entities divested;\n\u00b7\nmanaging and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations and terminating unfavorable relationships;\n\u00b7\nintegrating the acquired company\u2019s systems into our management information systems;\n\u00b7\nsatisfying unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, which could require the expenditure of material amounts of cash;\n\u00b7\noperating in the geographic market or industry sector of the business acquired in which we may have little or no experience;\n\u00b7\nimproving and expanding our management information systems to accommodate expanded operations; and\n\u00b7\nlosing key employees of acquired operations.\nAny of these factors could prevent ZAP Jonway from realizing the anticipated benefits of a strategic transaction, and our failure to realize these benefits could reduce our sales below and increase our costs above our forecasts. Acquisitions may also be dilutive to our earnings per share if our projections and assumptions about the acquired business\u2019 future operating results prove to be inaccurate. As a result, although our goal is to improve our business and maximize shareholder value, any transactions that we complete may ultimately fail to increase our sales and net income and stock price.\nChina\u2019s foreign exchange control policy may restrict ZAP Jonway from repatriating profit from Chinese subsidiaries to ZAP and may further restrict ZAP Jonway in the future.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China regulates the conversion between the RMB and foreign currencies. Over the years, the government has significantly reduced its control over routine foreign exchange transactions under current accounts, including trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, payment of dividends and service of foreign debt. However, foreign exchange transactions by subsidiaries in China under capital accounts continue to be subject to significant foreign controls and require the approval of and or registration with, governmental authorities. There can be no assurance that these laws and regulations on foreign investment will not cast uncertainties on financing and operating plans in China. Under current foreign exchange regulations in China, subject to relevant registration at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, (\u201cSAFE\u201d), Jonway will be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the current foreign exchange policies regarding debt service and payment of dividends in foreign currencies will persist in their current formulation. Changes in foreign exchange policies in the People\u2019s Republic of China might have a negative impact on ZAP Jonway\u2019s ability to repatriate profit from Jonway to ZAP.\nIf ZAP Jonway fails to manage future growth effectively, we may not be able to market and sell our vehicles successfully.\nThe majority of ZAP Jonway sales are from Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co. Ltd. For the year ended December 31, 2014 of the total sales of $28.7 million Jonway Automobile accounted for $27.9 million. Any failure to manage ZAP Jonway\u2019s growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. ZAP Jonway\u2019s future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this expansion include:\n\u00b7\ndevelopment of sales network and dealerships;\n\u00b7\nfinancially strong partnerships internationally that can help distribute and expand sales and marketing for the targeted regions;\nForecasting production and revenue;\n\u00b7\ncontrolling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations; establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities;\n\u00b7\nimplementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes;\n\u00b7\naddressing new markets with adequate advertisement, branding and promotion; and\n\u00b7\nexpanding international operations with experienced international sales team.\nForecasting production and revenue;\n\u00b7\ncontrolling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations; establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities;\n\u00b7\nimplementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes;\n\u00b7\naddressing new markets with adequate advertisement, branding and promotion; and\n\u00b7\nexpanding international operations with experienced international sales team.\n.\nZAP Jonway has suffered some losses in personnel in 2013, and intends to replace these losses with more experienced and skilled people to do sales and marketing, financial management, design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for our vehicles. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing vehicles, particularly electric vehicles, is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm ZAP Jonway\u2019s business and prospects.\n.\nIf ZAP Jonway is unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and vehicle engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nThe loss of the services of any of ZAP Jonway\u2019s key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results. In particular, ZAP Jonway is highly dependent on the services of Priscilla Lu, Chairman of ZAP\u2019s Board, Chuck Schillings, Alex Wang, ZAP\u2019s Co-Chief Executive Officers and Fung Chi Kwong, ZAP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Only two of ZAP Jonway\u2019s key employees are bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. These employees are Chuck Schillings and Fung Chi Kwong. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team. There is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones.\nZAP Jonway is subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities.\nAs an automobile manufacturer, ZAP Jonway and our operations, both in the United States, in China and abroad, are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.\nContamination at properties formerly owned or operated by ZAP Jonway, as well as at properties we will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on ZAP Jonway\u2019s financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our planned manufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s business may be adversely affected by union activities.\nAlthough none of ZAP Jonway\u2019s employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. As we expand our business, there can be no assurances that our employees will not join or form a labor union or that we will not be required to become a union signatory. ZAP Jonway is also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nZAP Jonway is subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles, the sale of our motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and ZAP Jonway faces risks associated with changes to these regulations such as:\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities could increase the cost of electricity;\n\u00b7\nthe increase of subsidies for corn and ethanol production could reduce the operating cost of vehicles that use ethanol or a combination of ethanol and gasoline;\n\u00b7\nchanges to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of lithium-ion batteries, such as the UN Recommendations of the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations or regulations adopted by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration could increase the cost of lithium-ion batteries;\n\u00b7\nincreased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs and business models based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs of such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles; and changes to regulations governing exporting of our products could increase our costs incurred to deliver products outside the United States or force us to charge a higher price for our vehicles in such jurisdictions.\nIn addition, as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics for vehicle systems, The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and other regulatory bodies may in the future increase regulation for these electronic systems.\nTo the extent the laws change, some or all of ZAP Jonway\u2019s vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, ZAP Jonway\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\nThe battery packs in ZAP Jonway\u2019s electric vehicles make use of lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptops and cell phones. We also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells in the battery pack for certain future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. The events have also raised questions about the suitability of these lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. ZAP Jonway has delivered only a limited number of electric vehicles with lithium-ion battery cells to customers and has limited field experience with these vehicles. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. There can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt ZAP Jonway\u2019s operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor\u2019s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to ZAP Jonway\u2019s, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nZAP Jonway may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if ZAP Jonway is not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nThe risk of product liability claims, product recalls, and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of vehicles. ZAP Jonway may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. ZAP Jonway\u2019s risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. ZAP maintains product liability insurance for all ZAP vehicles with annual limits of approximately $2 million on a claim made basis, but we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims and the product liability insurance does not extend to Jonway products. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of ZAP Jonway\u2019s coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates.\nIn connection with the development and sale of ZAP Jonway\u2019s planned vehicles, we will need to comply with various safety regulations and requirements, such as certain frontal impact tests, which are required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the United States. We may experience difficulties in meeting all the criteria for this test or similar tests for our planned electric vehicles, which may delay our ability to sell them in high volumes in certain jurisdictions.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events.\nZAP\u2019s corporate headquarters are located in California, a region known for seismic activity. Jonway\u2019s manufacturing facility is located in Sanmen, China. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, ZAP Jonway\u2019s facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf ZAP Jonway\u2019s suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nZAP Jonway does not control our independent suppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices, such as environmental responsibility, fair wage practices, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations.\nViolation of labor or other laws by ZAP Jonway\u2019s suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and ZAP Jonway\u2019s brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. If we, or other manufacturers in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks related to Intellectual Property\nZAP Jonway may need to defend itself against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations or individuals, including ZAP Jonway\u2019s competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop or sell our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs, electric motors or electronic power management systems may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise asserting their rights and seeking licenses. In addition, if ZAP Jonway is determined to have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\ncease selling, incorporating or using vehicles that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages;\n\u00b7\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u00b7\nredesign our vehicles.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nZAP Jonway also licenses intellectual property from third parties, and we may face claims that our use of this in-licensed technology infringes the rights of others. In that case, we may seek indemnification from our licensors under our license contracts with them. However, our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s business will be adversely affected if ZAP Jonway is unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\nAny failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in ZAP Jonway\u2019s competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2014, we had 20 issued patents and approximately 28 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and our majority-owned subsidiary Jonway had 16 issued patents\nThe protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities. However, such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents;\n\u00b7\nour patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented intellectual property rights or for other reasons;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable;\n\u00b7\ncurrent and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents; and\n\u00b7\nour in-licensed patents may be invalidated or the holders of these patents may seek to breach our license arrangements.\nExisting trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ZAP Jonway\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult.\nZAP Jonway\u2019s patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe cannot be certain that ZAP or Jonway are the first creator of inventions covered by their respective pending patent applications or that they are the first to file patent applications on these inventions, nor can we be certain that any of ZAP or Jonway\u2019s pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against any competitor. In addition, patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus ZAP Jonway cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issue U.S. patents will be issued. Furthermore, if these patent applications issue, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States.\nThe status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. As a result, ZAP Jonway cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued, or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the near future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, patents issued to ZAP, Jonway or ZAP Jonway may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that ZAP Jonway need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of ZAP Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership among ZAP\u2019s existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nZAP\u2019s executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 69.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock, including securities convertible into shares of ZAP common stock. As a result, these shareholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these shareholders.\nZAP may face risks associated with past sales of unregistered securities.\nIn the past, ZAP has sold numerous securities which were not registered under federal or state securities laws. ZAP has strived to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws in connection with our issuances of unregistered securities. However, to the extent ZAP has not complied, ZAP may face liability for the purchase price of the securities sold, together with interest and the potential of regulatory sanctions.\nZAP\u2019s stock price and trading volume may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for ZAP\u2019s shareholders.\nThe equity trading markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of ZAP\u2019s common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition. In addition, the trading volume in ZAP\u2019s common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. ZAP has experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock over the past few years. We cannot assure you that the market price of ZAP\u2019s common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nZAP does not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nZAP has not paid cash dividends on ZAP\u2019s common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on ZAP\u2019s common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase ZAP\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 88273, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "ZAAP"}
