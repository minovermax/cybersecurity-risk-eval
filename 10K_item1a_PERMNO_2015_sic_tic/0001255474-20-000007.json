{"cik": "1255474", "company": "WHITING PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nEach of the risks described below should be carefully considered, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. In the event of the occurrence, reoccurrence, continuation or increased severity of any of the risks described below, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOil and natural gas prices are very volatile. An extended period of low oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe oil and gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. The price we receive for our oil, NGL and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf changes in regional, domestic and global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf market demand and capacity limitations on exports of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions, including embargoes and sanctions, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activity, such as the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela and Iran and conflicts in the Middle East;\n\u25cf developments of North American energy infrastructure;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf the effects of global conservation and sustainability measures;\n\u25cf proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u25cf the effects of global and domestic economy, including the impact of expected growth, access to credit, financial and other economic issues;\n\u25cf weather conditions;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf current and anticipated changes to domestic and foreign governmental regulations, such as regulation of oil and natural gas gathering and transportation, including those that may arise as a result of the upcoming U.S. Presidential election;\n\u25cf the price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf basis differentials associated with market conditions, the quality and location of production and other factors;\n\u25cf acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u25cf acts of force majeure.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements. Also, prices for crude oil and prices for natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem. Declines in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue, but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and therefore potentially lower our oil and gas reserve quantities. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences extended periods of low prices, we may, among other things, be unable to meet all of our financial obligations or make planned expenditures.\nSubstantial and extended declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices have resulted and may continue to result in impairments of our proved oil and gas properties or undeveloped acreage and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. To the extent commodity prices received from production are insufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, we will be required to reduce spending, sell assets or borrow to fund any such shortfall. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of our borrowing base under our credit agreement, which is determined at the discretion of our lenders based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to the lenders, and is subject to regular redeterminations on May 1 and November 1 of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement. Upon a redetermination, if total outstanding credit exposure exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we will be required to prepay outstanding borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess in six substantially equal monthly installments.\nLower commodity prices may also make it more difficult for us to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt as described under the risk factor entitled \u201cThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\u201d\nAlternatively, higher oil, NGL and natural gas prices may result in significant mark-to-market losses being incurred on our commodity-based derivatives, which may in turn cause us to experience net losses.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Refer to the risk factor entitled \u201cReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate...\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf substantial or extended declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf delays in or limits on the issuance of drilling permits by state agencies or on our federal leases, including as a result of government shutdowns;\n\u25cf pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u25cf pipeline takeaway and refining and processing capacity;\n\u25cf shortages of or delays in obtaining qualified personnel or equipment, including drilling rigs and completion services;\n\u25cf equipment failures or accidents;\n\u25cf adverse weather events, such as floods, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and freezing temperatures; and\n\u25cf title defects.\nOur debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding $262 million of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 2020 and $2.2 billion of senior notes, which consisted of $774 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due March 2021, $408 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due April 2023 and $1,000 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due January 2026. We had $375 million of borrowings and $2 million in letters of credit outstanding under Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation\u2019s (\u201cWhiting Oil and Gas\u201d) credit facility with $1.4 billion of available borrowing capacity. The credit agreement matures on April 12, 2023, provided that if at any time and for so long as any senior notes (other than the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 2020) have a maturity date prior to 91 days after April 12, 2023, the maturity date shall be the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of such senior notes. We are allowed to incur additional indebtedness, provided that we meet certain requirements in the indentures governing our senior notes and Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement.\nOur level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt could have important consequences for our operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes;\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u25cf increasing the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due or otherwise refinance our indebtedness;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors;\n\u25cf making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because debt under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement is subject to certain rate variability;\n\u25cf making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u25cf reducing our borrowing base when oil and natural gas prices decline and our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations.\nWe may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our repayment of outstanding debt. Refer to the risk factor entitled \u201cThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\u201d\nIf we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or are unable to use future borrowings to refinance our indebtedness or fund other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.\nOur earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and service our debt. Factors that may cause us to generate cash flow that is insufficient to meet our debt obligations include the events and risks related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. Any cash flow insufficiency would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness, we may be required to undertake various alternative financing plans, which may include:\n\u25cf refinancing or restructuring all or a portion of our debt;\n\u25cf seeking alternative financing or additional capital investment;\n\u25cf selling strategic assets;\n\u25cf reducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u25cf revising or delaying our strategic plans.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of the above alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness or otherwise fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement and the holders of our senior notes and convertible senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable. Additionally, the lenders under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money and could foreclose against our assets collateralizing our borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the amounts outstanding under any of our significant indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects.\nSuch developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting our future financial results. Refer to the Risk Factor entitled \u201cNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\u201d\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes and Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that may limit our management\u2019s discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u25cf make loans and investments;\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf create certain liens;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf enter into hedging contracts; and\n\u25cf create unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement requires us, as of the last day of any quarter, to maintain the following ratios (as defined in the credit agreement): (i) a consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities ratio (which includes an add back of the available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and (ii) a total debt to last four quarters\u2019 EBITDAX ratio of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. If we were in violation of these covenants, then we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness, including under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement. Also, the indentures under which we issued our senior notes restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness and making certain restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions, unless our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) is at least 2.0 to 1.0. Factors that may adversely affect our ability to comply with these covenants include oil or natural gas price declines, lack of liquidity in property and capital markets and our inability to execute on our business plan.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes, Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make further funds available to us. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets or be able to borrow sufficient funds to repay or refinance that indebtedness. Also, if we are in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we will not be able to pay dividends on our capital stock.\nMoreover, the borrowing base limitation on Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement is redetermined on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and may be the subject of special redeterminations described in such credit agreement based on an evaluation of our oil and gas reserves. Because oil and gas prices are principal inputs into the valuation of our reserves, if oil and gas prices decline, our borrowing base could be reduced at the next redetermination date or during future redeterminations. Upon a redetermination, if total outstanding credit exposure exceeds the redetermined borrowing base, we will be required to prepay outstanding borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess in six substantially equal monthly installments. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and a failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for investing our capital resources to produce rates of return. In developing our business plan, we consider allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including well development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. We also consider our likely sources of capital, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit\nagreement. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and future growth may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nA large portion of our producing properties are concentrated in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nA large portion of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. At December 31, 2019, approximately 93% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. Because of this concentration in a limited geographic area, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to regional factors compared to competitors having more geographically dispersed operations. These factors include, among others: (i) the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and rail transportation capacity constraints, (ii) the availability of rigs, equipment, oilfield services, supplies and labor, (iii) the availability of processing and refining facilities and (iv) infrastructure capacity. In addition, our operations in the Williston Basin may be adversely affected by severe weather events such as floods, blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes and freezing temperatures which can intensify competition for the items and services described above and may result in periodic shortages. The concentration of our operations in a limited geographic area also increases our exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife and unexpected events that may occur in the regions such as natural disasters, seismic events (which may result in third-party lawsuits), industrial accidents, labor difficulties, civil disturbances, public protests or terrorist attacks. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf oil, NGL and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our producing oil and gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews (which may include depressed oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, possible asset sales and other factors) we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties. For example, we recorded an $835 million impairment charge during 2017 for the partial write-down of the Redtail field in Colorado. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period recognized.\nWe may continue to incur cash and noncash charges that would negatively impact our future results of operations and liquidity.\nWhile executing our strategic priorities to reduce financial leverage and complexity and to lower our capital expenditures in the face of lower commodity prices, we have incurred certain cash charges. As we continue to focus on our strategic priorities, we may incur additional cash and noncash charges in the future. If incurred, these charges could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations in the period recognized.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations. The process involves the injection of mainly water and sand plus a de minimis amount of chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We expect that we will utilize hydraulic fracturing for the foreseeable future to complete or recomplete wells in the areas in which we work. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated at the state level, however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) issued guidance in 2014 to address hydraulic fracturing injections involving diesel. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule promulgating pretreatment standards for discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. The EPA,\nalong with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Department of Interior and the White House Council for Environmental Quality continue to study various aspects of hydraulic fracturing.\nIn addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Multiple states, including Texas, Colorado and Wyoming have already adopted rules requiring disclosures of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and others have enacted regulations imposing additional requirements on activities involving hydraulic fracturing. Chemical disclosure regulations may increase compliance costs and may limit our ability to use cutting-edge technology in markets where disclosure is required. Further, laws such as those restricting the use of or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling or hydraulic fracturing (such as setback ordinances) may impact our ability to fully extract reserves. No assurance can be given as to whether or not such measures might be considered or implemented in the jurisdictions in which our properties are located. If new laws, regulations or ordinances that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in the states or local municipalities where our properties are located, such legal requirements could prohibit or make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities.\nFurther, in May 2014, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to the disclosure of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. On July 11, 2014, the EPA extended the public comment period for the rulemaking to September 18, 2014. The EPA has not yet taken further action with respect to this rule. Depending on the precise disclosure requirements the EPA elects to impose, if any, we may be obliged to disclose valuable proprietary information, and failure to do so may subject us to penalties. In addition, we may be required to disclose information of third parties, which may be inaccurate or which we may be contractually prohibited from disclosing, which could also subject us to penalties.\nIn addition, in July 2014, a major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008. This study, as well as subsequent studies and reports, may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells. If such new laws or rules are adopted, our operations may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved.\nRefer to \u201cHydraulic Fracturing\u201d in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on hydraulic fracturing.\nWe have entered into physical delivery contracts and do not expect to be able to deliver all the oil required under such contracts and, as a result, we expect we will be required to make deficiency payments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had three physical delivery contracts which require us to deliver fixed volumes of crude oil. One of these contracts is tied to oil production at our Sanish field in Mountrail County, North Dakota, the second is tied to oil production in the Williston Basin and the third is tied to oil production at our Redtail field in Weld County, Colorado. Although we believe that our production and reserves are sufficient to fulfill the delivery commitments at our Sanish field in North Dakota and the Williston Basin, if we fail to deliver the committed volumes, we would be required to pay deficiency payments of $7.00 and $5.75, respectively, per undelivered barrel (subject to upward adjustment). At our Redtail field, we have determined that it is not probable that future oil production will be sufficient to meet the minimum volume requirements under the contract in this area. We expect to make periodic deficiency payments under the Redtail contract that currently total $5.24 per undelivered Bbl through the April 2020 termination date. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, total deficiency payments under this contract amounted to $64 million, $37 million and $42 million, respectively. Refer to \u201cProperties - Delivery Commitments\u201d for more information about these delivery contracts.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as the following, among others:\n\u25cf historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas;\n\u25cf the assumed effect of governmental regulation; and\n\u25cf assumptions about future prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas including differentials, production and development costs, gathering and transportation costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and availability of funds.\nTherefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, oil, NGL and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, exploration and development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, as referred to in this report, is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on 12-month average prices and current costs as of the date of the estimate. The 12-month average prices used for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $55.69 per Bbl of oil and $2.58 per MMBtu of natural gas. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the estimate. If the 12-month average oil prices used to calculate our oil reserves decline by $1.00 per Bbl, then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 would have decreased by $137 million. If the 12-month average natural gas prices used to calculate our natural gas reserves decline by $0.10 per MMBtu, then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 would have decreased by $41 million.\nOur exploration and development operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash flows, equity and debt issuances, bank borrowings, agreements with industry partners and oil and gas property divestments. We intend to finance future capital expenditures substantially with cash flow from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our credit agreement and proceeds from asset divestitures. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u25cf our proved reserves;\n\u25cf the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u25cf the costs of producing oil and natural gas; and\n\u25cf our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit agreement decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, or for any other reason, then we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels.\nWe may, from time to time, need to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional financing. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, particularly in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets\nor may significantly increase our cost to borrow. If cash generated by operations or available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the inability to access the cash and credit markets to obtain additional financing, on favorable terms or otherwise, could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, we may not be able to sustain production.\nUnless we conduct successful exploration, development and production activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline over time. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and producing our current reserves and finding economically recoverable or acquiring additional economically recoverable reserves. In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire attractive companies or properties. Therefore, we may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to sustain or replace our current and future production, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur credit rating could negatively impact our availability and cost of capital and could require us to post more collateral under certain commercial arrangements.\nSome of our counterparties have requested or required us to post collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as gathering, transportation, processing and hedging agreements. These collateral requirements depend, in part, on our credit rating. We may be requested or required by other counterparties to post additional collateral, which may be in the form of additional letters of credit, cash or other acceptable collateral. Any downgrade to our credit ratings could impact the posting of collateral consisting of cash or letters of credit, which would reduce availability under our credit agreement and negatively impact our liquidity.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production.\nIn connection with our continued development of oil and gas properties, we are exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells on these properties, caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production or the interruption of transporting oil and gas volumes produced. In addition, market conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, NGLs and natural gas, downstream market conditions and competing supply alternatives. Our ability to market our production also depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties and the ability to obtain such services on acceptable terms. We may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by market constraints or the interruption of transporting oil and gas produced. This could lead to production curtailments or shut-ins, and reduced revenue which could materially harm our business. We may enter into arrangements for transportation services and sales to reduce curtailment risks. However, these services expose us to the risk that third parties will default on their obligations under such arrangements.\nRisks associated with the production, gathering, transportation and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas could adversely affect net income and cash flows.\nOur net income and cash flows will depend upon, among other things, oil, NGL and natural gas production and the prices received and costs incurred to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling, production or transportation accidents that temporarily or permanently halt the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas will decrease revenues and increase expenditures. For example, accidents may occur that result in personal injuries, property damage, damage to productive formations or equipment and environmental damages. Any costs incurred in connection with any such accidents that are not insured against will have the effect of reducing net income. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. Also, our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends in large part on the proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and transportation facilities which are mostly owned by third parties. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. Similarly, curtailments or damage to pipelines and other transportation facilities used to transport oil, NGL and natural gas production to markets for sale could decrease revenues or increase transportation expenses. Any such curtailments or damage to the gathering systems could also require finding\nalternative means to transport oil, NGL and natural gas production, which alternative means could result in additional costs that will have the effect of increasing transportation expenses.\nAlso, accidents involving rail cars could result in significant personal injuries and property and environmental damage. In May 2015, the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration issued new rules applicable to \u201chigh-hazard flammable trains\u201d, discussed in \u201cItem 1 Business - Regulation - Regulation of Sale and Transportation of Oil\u201d above, which could increase transportation expenses. Similarly, regulatory responses to the October 2015 failure at a Southern California underground natural gas storage facility could also lead to increased expenses for underground storage.\nIn addition, drilling, production and transportation of hydrocarbons bear the inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include, but are not limited to, loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, personal injuries and death, contamination of air, soil, ground water and surface water, as well as potential fines, penalties or damages associated with any of the foregoing consequences.\nPart of our business strategy includes selling properties which subjects us to various risks.\nPart of our business strategy includes selling properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own. However, there is no assurance that such sales will occur in the time frames or with the economic terms we expect. Unless we conduct successful exploration, development and production activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, divestitures of our properties will reduce our proved reserves and potentially our production. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves sufficient to replace such reserves and production from any of the properties we sell. Additionally, agreements pursuant to which we sell properties may include terms that survive closing of the sale, including but not limited to indemnification provisions, which could result in us retaining substantial liabilities.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in substantial lease renewal costs, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established on our undeveloped acreage, the underlying leases will expire. As of December 31, 2019, the portion of our net undeveloped acreage that is subject to expiration over the next three years, if not successfully developed or renewed, is approximately 18% in 2020, 13% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, on certain portions of our acreage, third-party leases become immediately effective if our leases expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe unavailability or cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis or within our budget.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, completion crews and other oilfield equipment as demand for these items has increased along with the number of wells being drilled and completed. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs and other oilfield goods and services. Shortages of field personnel and other professionals, drilling rigs, completion crews, equipment or supplies or price increases could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations, which could restrict such operations or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nWe have specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These scheduled drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs of oil field\ngoods and services, drilling results, our ability to extend drilling acreage leases beyond expiration, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or require us to remove certain proved undeveloped reserves from our proved reserve base if we are unable to drill those PUD locations within the SEC\u2019s 5-year window.\nWeaker price differentials and/or weaker benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production generally trade at a discount, but sometimes at a premium, to the relevant benchmark prices such as NYMEX. A negative or positive difference between the benchmark price and the price received is called a differential. The differential may vary significantly due to market conditions, the quality and location of production and other risk factors, as demonstrated in the fourth quarter of 2018 when our oil differentials weakened substantially. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in the differential and decreases in the benchmark price for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain indemnities from sellers for liabilities they may have created.\nOur business strategy includes a continuing acquisition program. From 2010 through 2019, we completed 7 separate significant acquisitions of producing properties with a combined purchase price of $4.6 billion for estimated proved reserves as of the effective dates of the acquisitions of 240.2 MMBOE. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires assessment of many factors, which are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the anticipated levels of recoverable reserves, earnings or cash flow;\n\u25cf future oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf estimates of operating costs;\n\u25cf estimates of future development costs;\n\u25cf timing of future development costs;\n\u25cf estimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown potential environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs, including for example, title defects, historical spills or releases for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate.\nFurthermore, acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks associated with acquisitions, either completed or future acquisitions, include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and to realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u25cf acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u25cf we may issue additional equity or debt securities in order to fund future acquisitions.\nOur assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well, platform, facility or pipeline. Inspections may not reveal structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion or groundwater contamination,\nwhen they are made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that it created. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nOur use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts involves only a portion of our anticipated production, may limit higher revenues in the future in connection with commodity price increases and may result in significant fluctuations in our net income.\nWe enter into hedging transactions of our oil and natural gas production revenues to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas. Our hedging transactions to date have consisted of financially settled crude oil and natural gas options contracts, primarily costless collars and swaps, placed with major financial institutions. As of February 20, 2020, we had contracts covering the sale of 31 MMBbl of oil per day for the remainder of 2020 and 6 MMBbl of oil per day for all of 2021. All of our oil hedges will expire by December 2021. Refer to \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A and the \u201cDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d footnote of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for pricing information and a more detailed discussion of our hedging transactions.\nWe may in the future enter into these and other types of hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of oil and natural gas, or alternatively, we may decide to unwind or restructure the hedging arrangements we previously entered into. Hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including if production is less than expected, the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received. Hedging transactions may limit the benefit we may otherwise receive from increases in the price for oil and natural gas. Our three-way collars only provide partial protection against declines in market prices due to the fact that when the market price falls below the sub-floor, the minimum price we will receive will be NYMEX plus the difference between the floor and sub-floor. Furthermore, if we do not engage in hedging transactions or unwind hedging transactions we previously entered into, then we may be more adversely affected by declines in oil and natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging transactions. Additionally, hedging transactions may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nWe recognize all gains and losses from changes in commodity derivative fair values immediately in earnings rather than deferring any such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Consequently, we may experience significant net losses, on a non-cash basis, due to changes in the value of our hedges as a result of commodity price volatility.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and gas operations in the Rocky Mountains are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife. In certain areas, drilling and other oil and gas activities can only be conducted during certain months. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. Resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations, cause temporary declines in our oil and gas production and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including, but not limited to, the possibility of:\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u25cf abnormally pressured formations;\n\u25cf mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u25cf the loss of well control;\n\u25cf fires and explosions;\n\u25cf personal injuries and death;\n\u25cf terrorist attacks; and\n\u25cf natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to our company. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then it could adversely affect us.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues and increase capital expenditures.\nWe operate 88% of our net productive oil and natural gas wells, which represents 92% of our proved developed producing reserves as of December 31, 2019. If we do not operate the properties in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of our properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations or an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s decisions with respect to the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the period of time over which the operator seeks to generate a return on capital expenditures, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, and the use of technology, as well as the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources and the operator\u2019s relative interest in the field. Operators may also opt to decrease operational activities following a significant decline in, or a sustained period of low, oil or natural gas prices. Because we do not have a majority interest in most wells we do not operate, we may not be in a position to remove the operator in the event of poor performance. Accordingly, while we use reasonable efforts to cause the operator to act in a prudent manner, we are limited in our ability to do so.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and we may incur impairment charges if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nOur drilling results in undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and producing. Since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. Therefore, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. Furthermore, if drilling results are unsuccessful, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays. For example, during 2018 we recorded an $8 million non-cash charge for the impairment of undeveloped oil and gas properties where we have no current or future plans to drill. We may also incur such impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken. Additionally, our rights to develop a portion of our undeveloped acreage may expire if not successfully developed or renewed. Refer to \u201cAcreage\u201d in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information relating to the expiration of our rights to develop undeveloped acreage.\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf discharge permits for drilling operations;\n\u25cf drilling bonds;\n\u25cf reports concerning operations;\n\u25cf well spacing;\n\u25cf unitization and pooling of properties; and\n\u25cf taxation.\nUnder these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and litigation. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nOur operations may incur substantial costs and liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands; and impose substantial liabilities for unauthorized discharges. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations, the imposition of injunctive relief, or certain leases could be cancelled in the event that an agency refuses to issue or delays the issuance of a required permit. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previous contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or if our operations were standard in the industry at the time they were performed. Private parties, including the surface owners of properties upon which we drill, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Moreover, federal law and some state laws allow the government to place a lien on real property for costs incurred by the government to address contamination on the property.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and may have a materially adverse impact on our business. Compliance with any enacted rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance of environmental laws and regulations.\nFor example, in 2012, the EPA published final rules under the Federal Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d) that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. With regard to production activities, these rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and, in particular, requiring some of these wells to use reduced emission completions, also known as \u201cgreen completions\u201d, after January 1, 2015. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, pneumatic controllers and storage vessels.\nThe requirements were further expanded again in 2016 when the implementation of Subpart OOOOa applied limits on methane emissions to oil and gas facilities and required operators to address leaks, also known as \u201cfugitive emissions.\u201d\nHowever, in September 2019, the EPA proposed two alternative amendments to the Subpart OOOOa Rule. Both amendments remove all methane-specific requirements from production and processing segments. The first amendment would also remove transportation and storage facilities from the definition of covered facilities. The comment period for proposed rule closed on November 25, 2019. The net effect of any of these amendments, if finalized, would significantly reduce compliance obligations and associated costs.\nThe enactment of Senate Bill 19-181 \u201cProtect Public Welfare Oil And Gas Operations\u201d increased the regulatory authority of local governments in Colorado over the surface impacts of oil and gas development, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn Colorado, on April 16, 2019, Governor Polis signed into law the final version of Senate Bill 19-181 (\u201cSB 181\u201d), known as the \u201cProtect Public Welfare Oil and Gas Operations\u201d legislation. SB 181 amends the Oil and Gas Conservation Act and other statutes to change the manner in which oil and gas development is regulated in Colorado and provide the opportunity for greater control to local governments. The amendments include changes to expand the authority of local governments relating to oil and gas development, as well as rulemaking requirements involving the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (\u201cCOGCC\u201d) and the Air Quality Control Commission (\u201cAQCC\u201d) that could include more stringent air emission limits for pollutants such as methane and volatile organic carbons and more rigorous permitting requirements. In December 2019, Colorado\u2019s AQCC adopted new rules targeting air emissions from upstream oil and gas operations, and depending on the results of other ongoing and upcoming rulemakings and actions by COGCC, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and local jurisdictions, SB 181 could result in greater restrictions with respect to oil and gas development in Colorado, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Efforts similar to SB 181 are likely to continue in the future, which, if successful, could result in dramatically reducing the area available for future oil and gas development or outright banning oil and gas development in certain jurisdictions. We cannot predict the nature or outcome of future ballot initiatives, legislative actions or other similar efforts, or the effects of implementation of these efforts by local governments. If we are required to cease operating in any of the areas in which we now operate as the result of bans or moratoria on drilling or related oilfield services activities, it could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIssues surrounding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and gas that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climate changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA.\nAt present, the EPA may establish GHG permitting requirements for stationary sources already subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V requirements of the CAA. Certain of our equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, may also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHGs. For any equipment or installation so subject, we may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture related GHG emissions.\nIn October 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the rule applicable to GHGs for PSD and Title V permitting requirements. The public comment period for the rulemaking concluded on December 16, 2016. However, although the rulemaking remains on the EPA\u2019s long-term regulatory agenda, no final rule has been published.\nIn August 2015, the EPA issued a rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units. The rule, commonly called the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d, requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired generating units commencing in 2022, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030. However, in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while it was being challenged in court. On October 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan and on August 18, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (\u201cACE\u201d) rule as a replacement to the Clean Power Plan. The EPA issued the final ACE rule in June 2019. As expected, over 20 states and public health and environmental organizations have already challenged the rule. The EPA has sought expedited review in the hopes that the cases will be resolved by the summer of 2020.\nIn addition, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting and/or regional GHG \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs. Most of these \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved.\nAlso, in recent years, lawsuits have been brought against other energy companies for matters relating to climate change. Multiple states and localities have also initiated investigations in climate-change related matters. While the current suits focus on a variety of issues, at\ntheir core they seek compensation for the effects of climate change from companies with ties to GHG emissions. It is currently unknown what the outcome of these types of actions may be, but the costs of defending against such actions may rise. Finally, many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities.\nA low ESG or sustainability score could result in the exclusion of our common shares from consideration by certain investment funds and a negative perception of us by certain investors.\nCertain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) or sustainability metrics. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a company\u2019s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our common shares from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of us by certain investors.\nWe may be negatively impacted by litigation and legal proceedings.\nWe are subject from time to time, and in the future may become subject, to litigation claims. These claims and legal proceedings are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business and include, without limitation, claims relating to environmental, safety and health matters, commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers and customers, claims regarding ownership of mineral interests, including from royalty owners, claims regarding acquisitions and divestitures, regulatory matters and employment and labor matters. We may also become subject to governmental or regulatory proceedings. The outcome of such claims and legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to us. Among other pending litigation claims, the Company is involved with litigation related to a payment arrangement with a third party which currently claims damages up to $41 million, as well as court costs and interest. We also may not have insurance that covers such claims and legal proceedings. Successful claims or litigation against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, even if successful in resolving a claim or legal proceeding, such process could require the attention of members of our senior management, reducing the time they have available to devote to managing our business, and require us to incur substantial legal expenses.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect us.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel, including Bradley J. Holly, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bruce DeBoer, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary; Charles J. Rimer, Chief Operating Officer; Correne S. Loeffler, Chief Financial Officer; and Timothy M. Sulser, Chief Corporate Development and Strategy Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nWe expect to consider from time to time further strategic opportunities that may involve acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value, any of which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such transactions.\nWe expect to continue to consider acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. The Board and our management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, we may engage financial advisors, enter into non-disclosure agreements, conduct discussions, and undertake other actions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there would be uncertainty that any of these activities or discussions would result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to analyzing and pursuing such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations, and may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking such transactions or other strategic alternatives regardless of whether the transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition, disposition, partnership or other or strategic alternative in the future, we cannot be certain that we would fully realize the potential benefit of such a transaction and cannot predict the impact that such strategic transaction might have on our operations or stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory limitations and the interest of third parties in us and our assets. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any specific action or transaction. Further, any such strategic alternative may not ultimately lead to increased shareholder value. We do not undertake to provide updates or make further comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives, unless otherwise required by law.\nSubstantial acquisitions or other transactions could require significant external capital and could change our risk and property profile.\nIn order to finance acquisitions of additional producing or undeveloped properties, we may need to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments or other means. These changes in capitalization may significantly affect our risk profile. Additionally, significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of our operations and business. The character of the new properties may be substantially different in operating or geological characteristics or geographic location than our existing properties. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain external funding for additional future acquisitions or other transactions on economically acceptable terms or at all.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry and from alternative energy sources is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, obtaining investment capital, securing oilfield goods and services, marketing oil and natural gas products and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our resources allow. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nWe also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar, nuclear and electric power. The proliferation of alternative energy sources and businesses that provide such alternative energy sources may decrease the demand for oil and natural gas products. Decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn connection with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new regulations in this area may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of oil and gas derivative instruments we use to manage our risks related to oil and gas commodity price volatility.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted into law. This financial reform legislation includes provisions that require over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared. In addition, the legislation provides an exemption from mandatory clearing requirements based on regulations to be developed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC for transactions by non-financial institutions, such as us, to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. At the same time, the legislation includes provisions under which the CFTC may impose collateral requirements for transactions, including those that are used to hedge commercial risk. However, during drafting of the legislation, members of Congress adopted report language and issued a public letter stating that it was not their intention to impose margin and collateral requirements on counterparties that utilize transactions to hedge commercial risk. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation, like new margin requirements, may be established through rulemakings. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these rulemakings, new regulations in this area may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of oil and gas derivative instruments we use to hedge and to otherwise manage our financial risks related to volatility in oil and gas commodity prices.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cybersecurity attacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications. We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. We rely on such systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as contractor, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also have increased in frequency. A cyber-attack could include unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. It is possible that we could incur interruptions from cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses or malware, or that third party service providers could cause a breach of our data. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls over personally identifiable information and contractor data; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties for our computing and communications infrastructure or any other interruptions to, or breaches of, our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, loss of sensitive or confidential information or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.\nStrategic targets, such as energy-related assets and transportation assets, may be at greater risk of future cyber-attacks than other targets. The various procedures, facilities, infrastructure and controls we utilize to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats are costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. We do not expect to obtain or maintain specialized insurance for possible liability or loss resulting from a cyber-attack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business. However, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. State and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements, which could increase our cost of doing business.\nTo our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of an interruption to or a breach of our systems or those of our third party\nvendors and service providers. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of third parties, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others, any of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows:\n\u25cf unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or personally identifiable information, including by cyber-attacks or other security breaches, could cause loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to do business with us, disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and investigations;\n\u25cf a cyber-attack on a third party could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt development of additional infrastructure, effectively delaying the start of cash flow from the project;\n\u25cf a cyber-attack on downstream or midstream pipelines could prevent us from delivering product, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf a cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u25cf business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common shares.", "PERMNO": 89901, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WLL"}
