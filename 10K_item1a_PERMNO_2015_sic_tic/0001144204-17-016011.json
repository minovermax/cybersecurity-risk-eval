{"cik": "1533998", "company": "DarioHealth Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and warrants may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe were formed in August 2011 and are thus subject to the risks associated with new businesses.\nWe were formed in August 2011 as a new business and only recently entered the commercialization stage of our technology. As such, this limited operating history may not be adequate to enable you to fully assess our ability to develop and commercialize Dario\u2122, achieve market acceptance of Dario\u2122 and respond to competition. We commenced a commercial launch of the free DarioTM application in the United Kingdom in late 2013 and commenced an initial soft launch of the full DarioTM solution (including the app and the Smart Meter) in selected jurisdictions in March 2014 with the goal of collecting customer feedback to refine our longer-term roll-out strategy and continued to scale up launch during 2014 in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and New Zealand, in 2015 in Australia, Israel and Canada and in 2016 in the United States. These efforts have not generated material revenue, and it is still too early to predict if we will be able to generate significant revenues over the next 12 months. Therefore, we are, and expect for the foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties, inherent in a new business and the development and sale of new medical devices and related software applications. As a result, we may be unable to fully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, commercialize, manufacture, market, sell and derive material revenues from Dario\u2122 in the timeframes we project, if at all, and our inability to do so would materially and adversely impact our viability as a company. In addition, we still must establish many functions necessary to operate a business, including finalizing our managerial and administrative structure, continuing product and technology development, assessing and commencing our marketing activities, implementing financial systems and controls and personnel recruitment.\nAccordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their initial revenue generating stages, particularly those in the medical device and mobile heath fields. In particular, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u00b7 implement or execute our current business plan, or that our business plan is sound;\n\u00b7 maintain our management team and Board of Directors;\n\u00b7 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to effectuate our business plan;\n\u00b7 determine that our technologies that we have developed are commercially viable; and/or\n\u00b7 attract, enter into or maintain contracts with, and retain customers.\nIn the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nGiven our limited revenue and lack of positive cash flow, we will need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to us or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate.\nAccording to our management\u2019s estimates, based on our current cash on hand and further based on our budget and the assumption that initial commercial sales will commence during our anticipated timeframes, we believe that we will have sufficient resources to continue our activities only into July 2017.\nSince we might be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we will need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. We may also need additional funding for developing products and services, increasing our sales and marketing capabilities, and promoting brand identity, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes. Moreover, the regulatory compliance arising out of being a publicly registered company has dramatically increased our costs.\nWe do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Given our need for cash and that equity raising is the most common type of fundraising for companies like ours, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for stockholders of our company.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase our expenses and require that our assets be provided as a security for such debt. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or candidate products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFunding from any source may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly due to certain offering participation rights afforded to a lead investor that participated in our January 2017 private placement. If we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations and expenses, we may not be able to achieve or maintain competitiveness, which could lead to the failure of our business and the loss of your investment.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. As such, you cannot rely upon our historical operating performance to make an investment decision regarding our company.\nSince our inception, we have engaged primarily in research and development activities and only recently entered the commercialization stage. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common stock and convertible debt and have incurred losses in each year since inception including net losses of $11,607,000 and $7,296,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016 was approximately $55,000,000. We do not know whether or when we will become profitable. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to launch Dario\u2122 in additional European countries, and elsewhere and manufacture, market and sell Dario\u2122 where approved. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its report to our 2016 audited financial statements a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe only recently entered the commercialization stage, and the development and commercialization of Dario\u2122 is uncertain and expected to require substantial expenditures. We have not yet generated sufficient revenues from our operations to fund our activities, and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to obtain necessary financing to continue our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its auditors\u2019 report on the financial statements for December 31, 2016 a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. This going concern opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities or otherwise. Future reports on our financial statements may include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in the common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe only recently began commercializing Dario\u2122 and our success will depend on the acceptance of Dario\u2122 in the healthcare market.\nDario\u2122 has been CE marked since 2013, enabling us to commercialize in 32 countries across Europe as well as in certain other countries worldwide. It was also approved by the regulatory authorities in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Israel and South Africa, and most recently in December 2015, we received FDA clearance. As a result, we have a limited history of commercializing Dario\u2122 and commenced selling DatioTM in the United States in 2016.. We have limited experience engaging in commercial activities and limited established relationships with physicians and hospitals as well as third-party suppliers on whom we depend for the manufacture of our product. We are faced with the risk that the marketplace will not be receptive to Dario\u2122 over competing products and that we will be unable to compete effectively. Factors that could affect our ability to establish Dario\u2122 or any potential future product include:\n\u00b7 the development of products or devices which could result in a shift of customer preferences away from our device and services and significantly decrease revenue;\n\u00b7 the increased use of improved diabetes drugs that could encourage certain diabetics to test less often, resulting in less usage of self-monitoring test device for certain types of diabetics;\n\u00b7 the challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed) technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;\n\u00b7 the significant number of current competitors in BGMS market who have significantly greater brand recognition and more recognizable trademarks and who have established relationships with diabetics healthcare providers and payors; and\n\u00b7 intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price or at all.\nWe cannot assure you that Dario\u2122 or any future product will gain broad market acceptance. If the market for Dario\u2122 or any future product fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected, or if any of the technology and standards supported by us do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future sales, making the timing of any revenues difficult to predict.\nWe may be faced with lengthy customer evaluation and approval processes associated with Dario\u2122. Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense in developing customer adoption of Dario\u2122, which may not result in revenue generation. We must also obtain regulatory approvals of Dario\u2122 in certain jurisdictions as well as approval for insurance reimbursement in order to initiate sales of Dario\u2122, each of which is subject to risk and potential delays, and neither of which may actually occur. As such, we cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future sales.\nIf Dario\u2122 fails to satisfy current or future customer requirements, we may be required to make significant expenditures to redesign the product, and we may have insufficient resources to do so.\nDario\u2122 is being designed to address an evolving marketplace and must comply with current and evolving customer requirements in order to gain market acceptance. There is a risk that Dario\u2122 will not meet anticipated customer requirements or desires. If we are required to redesign our products to address customer demands or otherwise modify our business model, we may incur significant unanticipated expenses and losses, and we may be left with insufficient resources to engage in such activities. If we are unable to redesign our products, develop new products or modify our business model to meet customer desires or any other customer requirements that may emerge, our operating results would be materially adversely affected and our business might fail.\nWe expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from our principal technology, which leaves us subject to the risk of reliance on such technology.\nWe expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of products derived from our principal technology. Our initial product utilizing this technology is Dario\u2122. As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of Dario\u2122, including the product release cycles, regulatory issues, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition and economic and market conditions, would likely harm our operating results. We may be unable to develop other products utilizing our technology, which would likely lead to the failure of our business. Moreover, in spite of our efforts related to the registration of our technology, if patent protection is not available for our principal technology, the viability of Dario\u2122 and any other products that may be derived from such technology would likely be adversely impacted to a significant degree, which would materially impair our prospects.\nWe are dependent upon third-party manufacturers and suppliers making us vulnerable to supply shortages and problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of Dario\u2122 and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture Dario\u2122 on a commercial scale. Therefore, we rely on a limited number of suppliers who manufacture and assemble certain components of Dario\u2122. Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including, for example, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, equipment malfunction and environmental factors, failure to properly conduct their own business affairs, and infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our requirements. Our reliance on these third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf\nwe are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours;\n\u25cf\nthird parties may threaten or enforce their intellectual property rights against our suppliers, which may cause disruptions or delays in shipment, or may force our suppliers to cease conducting business with us;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\nour suppliers, especially new suppliers, may make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of Dario\u2122 or cause delays in shipment;\n\u25cf\nwe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers;\n\u25cf\nswitching components or suppliers may require product redesign and possibly submission to FDA, European Economic Area Notified Bodies, or other foreign regulatory bodies, which could significantly impede or delay our commercial activities;\n\u25cf\none or more of our sole- or single-source suppliers may be unwilling or unable to supply components of Dario\u2122;\n\u25cf\nother customers may use fair or unfair negotiation tactics and/or pressures to impede our use of the supplier;\n\u25cf\nthe occurrence of a fire, natural disaster or other catastrophe impacting one or more of our suppliers may affect their ability to deliver products to us in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf\nour suppliers may encounter financial or other business hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nWe may not be able to quickly establish additional or alternative suppliers if necessary, in part because we may need to undertake additional activities to establish such suppliers as required by the regulatory approval process. Any interruption or delay in obtaining products from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain products from qualified alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to switch to competing products. Given our reliance on certain single-source suppliers, we are especially susceptible to supply shortages because we do not have alternate suppliers currently available.\nWe rely in part on a small group of third-party distributors to effectively distribute our products.\nWe depend in part on medical device distributors for the marketing and selling of our products in certain territories in which we have launched product sales. We depend on these distributors\u2019 efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. These distributors typically sell a variety of other, non-competing products that may limit the resources they dedicate to selling Dario\u2122. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell Dario\u2122, in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer. Recruiting and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offering requires significant time and resources. To develop and expand our distribution, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distributors. Further, if our relationship with a successful distributor terminates, we may be unable to replace that distributor without disruption to our business. If we fail to maintain positive relationships with our distributors, fail to develop new relationships with other distributors, including in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing distributors effectively, or fail to provide distributors with competitive products on attractive terms, or if these distributors are not successful in their sales efforts, our revenue may decrease and our operating results, reputation and business may be harmed.\nFailure in our online and digital marketing efforts could significantly impact our ability to generate sales.\nIn several of our principal target markets, we utilize online and digital marketing in order to create awareness to Dario\u2122. Our management believes that using online advertisement through affiliate networks and a variety of other pay-for-performance methods will be superior for marketing and generating sales of Dario\u2122 rather than utilizing traditional, expensive retail channels. However, there is a risk that our marketing strategy could fail. Because we plan to use non-traditional retail sales tools and to rely on healthcare providers to educate our customers about Dario\u2122, we cannot predict the level of success, if any, that we may achieve by marketing Dario\u2122 via the Internet. The failure of our online marketing efforts would significantly and negatively impact our ability to generate sales.\nOur Dario\u2122 smart mobile application, which is a key to our business model, is available via Apple\u2019s iOS and via Google\u2019s Android platforms and maybe in the future via additional platforms. If we are unable to achieve or maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or similar platforms, or if the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store or any other applicable platform were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.\nA key component of the Dario\u2122 solution is an iPhone or Android application which includes tools to help diabetic patients manage their disease. This application is compatible with Apple\u2019s iOS and with Google\u2019s Android platforms and may in the future become compatible via additional platforms. If we are unable to make our Dario\u2122 application compatible with these platforms, or if there is any deterioration in our relationship with either Apple or Google or others after our application is available, our business would be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to each of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their respective storefronts. Each of Apple and Google has broad discretion to change its standard terms and conditions, including changes which could require us to pay to have our Dario\u2122 application available for downloading. In addition, these standard terms and conditions can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by Apple or Google. We may not receive any advance warning of such changes. In addition, each of Apple and Google have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions. In the event that either Apple or Google ever determines that we are in violation of its standard terms and conditions, including by a new interpretation, and prohibits us from distributing our Dario\u2122 application on its storefront, it would materially harm our business.\nAdditionally, we will rely on the continued function of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store as digital storefronts where our Dario\u2122 application may be obtained. There have been occasions in the past when these digital storefronts were unavailable for short periods of time or where there have been issues with the in-app purchasing functionality within the storefront. In the event that either the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store is unavailable or if in-app purchasing functionality within the storefront is non-operational for a prolonged period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of our customers to secure the Dario\u2122 application, which would materially harm our business.\nOur products are subject to technological changes which may impact their use.\nOur Dario\u2122 Smart Meter is currently designed to be plugged into the audio jack of a mobile device. In addition, we have recently completed the development of a version of the Dario\u2122 Smart Meter that connects to an iPhone 7 through the lightning jack instead of the missing audio jack. As a result, our products are subject to future technological changes to mobile devices that may occur in the future. If we are unable to modify our products to keep pace with such technological changes, it would have a material adverse effect the ability of our customers to use our products, which would materially harm our business.\nAs we conduct business internationally, we are susceptible to risks associated with international relationships.\nOutside of the United States, we operate our business internationally, presently in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Israel. The international operation of our business requires significant management attention, which could negatively affect our business if it diverts their attention from their other responsibilities. In the event that we are unable to manage the complications associated with international operations, our business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, doing business with foreign customers subjects us to additional risks that we do not generally face in the United States. These risks and uncertainties include:\n\u00b7 management, communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion;\n\u00b7 localization of products and services, including translation of foreign languages;\n\u00b7 delivery, logistics and storage costs;\n\u00b7 longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 difficulties supporting international operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties supporting customer services;\n\u00b7 changes in economic and political conditions;\n\u00b7 impact of trade protection measures;\n\u00b7 complying with import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 competition from companies with international operations, including large international competitors and entrenched local companies;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences, including foreign tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7 maintaining and servicing computer hardware in distant locations;\n\u00b7 keeping current and complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards, including local labor laws;\n\u00b7 securing or maintaining protection for our intellectual property; and\n\u00b7 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights, including the ability to transfer such rights to third parties, in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any or all of these risks could adversely affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause we expect to conduct a material portion of our business outside of the United States but report our financial results in U.S. Dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Our foreign operations will be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results are translated from the local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation. Specifically, the U.S. Dollar cost of our operations in Israel is influenced by any movements in the currency exchange rate of the New Israeli Shekel (NIS). Such movements in the currency exchange rate may have a negative effect on our financial results. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenue, operating expenses and net income. As exchange rates vary, sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from our or the capital market\u2019s expectations.\nNon-U.S. governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market Dario\u2122 and any future product in both the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our products. In some countries, particularly countries of the European Union, each of which has developed its own rules and regulations, pricing may be subject to governmental control under certain circumstances. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a medical device candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available products. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur Dario\u2122 Smart Meter, software application and associated business processes may contain undetected errors, which could limit our ability to provide our services and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings.\nDario\u2122 (including the Smart Meter and software application) may contain undetected errors, defects or bugs. As a result, our customers or end users may discover errors or defects in our products, software or the systems we design, or the products or systems incorporating our designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected. We may discover significant errors or defects in the future that we may not be able to fix. Our inability to fix any of those errors could limit our ability to provide our products, impair the reputation of our brand and diminish the attractiveness of our product offerings to our customers.\nIn addition, we may utilize third party technology or components in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us. Failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business.\nOur future performance will depend on the continued engagement of key members of our management team.\nOur future performance depends to a large extent on the continued services of members of our current management including, in particular, Erez Raphael, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Zvi Ben David, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. In the event that we lose the continued services of such key personnel for any reason, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, scientific and technical personnel, we may not be able to implement our business model successfully.\nWe believe that our management team must be able to act decisively to apply and adapt our business model in the rapidly changing markets in which we will compete. In addition, we will rely upon technical and scientific employees or third party contractors to effectively establish, manage and grow our business. Consequently, we believe that our future viability will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, scientific and technical personnel. In order to do so, we may need to pay higher compensation or fees to our employees or consultants than we currently expect and such higher compensation payments would have a negative effect on our operating results. Competition for experienced, high-quality personnel is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. We may not be able to hire or retain the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy. Our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Regulatory Approval\nThe regulatory clearance process which we must navigate is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining clearance for the commercialization of Dario\u2122 or our any future product.\nWe are not permitted to market Dario\u2122 until we receive regulatory clearance. To date, we have received regulatory clearance in Australia, Canada, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States and we are currently seeking approval in India.\nThe research, design, testing, manufacturing, labeling, selling, marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. There can be no assurance that, even after such time and expenditures, we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for clinical testing or for the manufacturing or marketing of any products. In addition, during the regulatory process, other companies may develop other technologies with the same intended use as our products.\nWe are also subject to numerous post-marketing regulatory requirements, which include labeling regulations and medical device reporting regulations, which may require us to report to different regulatory agencies if our device causes or contributes to a death or serious injury, or malfunctions in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, these regulatory requirements may change in the future in a way that adversely affects us. If we fail to comply with present or future regulatory requirements that are applicable to us, we may be subject to enforcement action by regulatory agencies, which may include, among others, any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7 untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7 customer notification, or orders for repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our current or future products;\n\u00b7 imposing operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production;\n\u00b7 refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to Dario\u2122 or future products;\n\u00b7 rescinding 510(k) clearance or suspending or withdrawing pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecution.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, on September 23, 2013, the FDA issued final guidance (which we refer to herein as the Guidance) for developers of mobile medical applications, or apps, which are software programs that run on mobile communication devices and perform the same functions as traditional medical devices. The Guidance outlines the FDA\u2019s tailored approach to mobile apps. The FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning it will not enforce requirements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) for the majority of mobile apps as they pose minimal risk to consumers. The FDA plans to focus its regulatory oversight on a subset of mobile medical apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended. We anticipate that the Dario\u2122 application will be subject to the FDA regulation as a \u201cmobile medical app.\u201d\nWe have conducted limited clinical studies of Dario\u2122. Clinical and pre-clinical data is susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent additional regulatory clearances.\nTo date, we have conducted limited clinical studies on Dario\u2122. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete additional clinical studies necessary to receive additional regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions. While studies conducted by us have produced results we believe to be encouraging and indicative of the potential efficacy of Dario\u2122, data already obtained, or in the future obtained, from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later pre-clinical studies and clinical studies. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent additional regulatory approvals. A number of companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies, even after promising results in earlier studies. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of an intended product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the device, resulting in delays to commercialization, and could materially harm our business. Even though we have received CE mark and FDA clearance of Dario\u2122, there can be no assurance that we will be able to receive approval for other potential applications of our principal technology, or that we will receive regulatory clearances from other targeted regions or countries.\nWe may be unable to complete required clinical trials, or we may experience significant delays in completing such clinical trials, which could significantly delay our targeted product launch timeframe and impair our viability and business plan.\nThe completion of any future clinical trials for Dario\u2122 or other trials that we may be required to undertake in the future could be delayed, suspended or terminated for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7 our failure or inability to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 sites participating in the trial may drop out of the trial, which may require us to engage new sites for an expansion of the number of sites that are permitted to be involved in the trial;\n\u00b7 patients may not enroll in, remain in or complete, the clinical trial at the rates we expect; and\n\u00b7 clinical investigators may not perform our clinical trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices.\nIf our clinical trial is delayed it will take us longer to ultimately commercialize Dario\u2122 and generate revenues. Moreover, our development costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trial or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. We may be faced with similar risks in connection with future trials we conduct. See \u201cBusiness - Clinical Trials\u201d for a description of our clinical trials performed to date.\nIf we or our manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation or any applicable state equivalent, our operations could be interrupted and our operating results could suffer.\nWe, our manufacturers and suppliers must, unless specifically exempt by regulation, follow the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR) and are also subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process. If our affiliates, our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in significant non-compliance or fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to adverse QSR inspectional findings, the FDA could take enforcement actions against us and our manufacturers which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. Accordingly, our operating results could suffer.\nWe are subject to the risk of reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trial work.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials. Contract research organizations may also assist us in the collection and analysis of data. These investigators and contract research organizations will not be our employees and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time that they devote to products that we develop. If independent investigators fail to devote sufficient resources to our clinical trials, or if their performance is substandard, it will delay the approval or clearance and commercialization of any products that we develop. Further, the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world require that we comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected. If our independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations fail to comply with good clinical practice, the results of our clinical trials could be called into question and the clinical development of our product candidates could be delayed. Failure of clinical investigators or contract research organizations to meet their obligations to us or comply with federal regulations could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business. Moreover, we intend to have several clinical trials in order to support our marketing efforts and business development purposes. Such clinical trials will be conducted by third parties as well. Failure of such clinical trials to meet their primary endpoints could adversely affect our marketing efforts.\nLegislative reforms to the United States healthcare system may adversely affect our revenues and business.\nFrom time to time, legislative reform measures are proposed or adopted that would impact healthcare expenditures for medical services, including the medical devices used to provide those services. For example, in March 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial changes in the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and the way that Medicare providers are reimbursed. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act requires certain medical device manufacturers and importers to pay an excise tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such medical devices are sold, beginning January 1, 2013.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2.0% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. On March 1, 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and on April 1, 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, enacted on December 26, 2013, extends these cuts to 2023. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In December 2014, Congress passed an omnibus funding bill (the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015) and a tax extenders bill, both of which may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump has recently publicly indicated an intent to lower healthcare costs through various potential initiatives. In addition, President Trump and other U.S. lawmakers have made statements about potentially repealing and/or replacing the Affordable Care Act, although specific legislation for such a repeal or replacement has not yet been introduced. While we are unable to predict what changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that future changes affect how our products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers our business could be adversely impacted.\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs, including delivery reforms such as expanded bundling of services. Hospitals are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, which may increase price sensitivity among customers for our products, and adversely affect sales, pricing, and utilization of our products. Some third-party payors must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. We cannot predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations.\nMany federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations apply to the BGMS business and medical devices. We may be subject to certain federal and state regulations, including the federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Law, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and other federal and state false claims laws. The medical device industry has been under heightened scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions involving manufacturers who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business, including arrangements with physician consultants. If our operations or arrangements are found to be in violation of such governmental regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment of our operations. All of these penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nProduct liability suits, whether or not meritorious, could be brought against us due to an alleged defective product or for the misuse of Dario\u2122 or our potential future products. These suits could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages, and an increase in our insurance rates.\nIf Dario\u2122 or any of our future products are defectively designed or manufactured contain defective components or are misused, or if someone claims any of the foregoing, whether or not meritorious, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation. Misusing our device or failing to adhere to the operating guidelines or the device producing inaccurate meter readings could cause significant harm to patients, including death. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to liability. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. While we maintain product liability insurance, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and could reduce revenue. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nPart of our business plan includes the storage and potential monetization of medical data of users of Dario\u2122. There are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (which we refer to as HIPAA). These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. We may face difficulties in holding such information in compliance with applicable law. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe failure to obtain or maintain patents, licensing agreements and other intellectual property could materially impact our ability to compete effectively.\nIn order for our business to be viable and to compete effectively, we need to develop and maintain, and we will heavily rely on, our proprietary position with respect to our technologies and intellectual property. We filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT) application for a \u201cFluids Testing Apparatus and Methods of Use\u201d in May 2011 which incorporates two U.S. provisional applications submitted in the preceding year. The PCT covers the specific processes related to blood glucose level measurement as well as more general methods of rapid tests of body fluids and has subsequently been converted into several national phase patent applications. We have also filed a significant number of other patent applications for aspects of both the Dario\u2122 Smart Meter and software. We have also obtained numerous Web domains.\nHowever, to date, we have only been issued two patents (which were issued in the United States) relating to how the Dario\u2122 blood glucose monitor draws power from and transmits data to a smart phone via the audio jack port. None of our other patents have been granted by a patent office. In addition, there are significant risks associated with our actual or proposed intellectual property. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our pending patent and other proprietary rights principally include the following:\n\u00b7 pending patent applications we have filed or will file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to opposition proceedings in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;\n\u00b7 other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u00b7 other companies may design their technologies around technologies we have licensed or developed; and\n\u00b7 enforcement of patents is complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any of our pending or future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions.\nIt is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we have licensed, our rights depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims alleging the violation of the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe may face significant expense and liability as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and intellectual property rights of others. In the event that another party has also filed a patent application or been issued a patent relating to an invention or technology claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial uncertainties and costs for us, even if the eventual outcome was favorable to us. We, or our licensors, also could be required to participate in interference proceedings involving issued patents and pending applications of another entity. An adverse outcome in an interference proceeding could require us to cease using the technology, substantially modify it or to license rights from prevailing third parties.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding relating to our licensed patents or patent applications, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, especially given our early stage of development. Our ability to enforce our patent protection could be limited by our financial resources, and may be subject to lengthy delays. A third party may claim that we are using inventions claimed by their patents and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as research, development and the sale of any future products. Such lawsuits are expensive and would consume significant time and other resources. There is a risk that a court will decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and will order us to stop the activities claimed by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having infringed their patents.\nMoreover, there is no guarantee that any prevailing patent owner would offer us a license so that we could continue to engage in activities claimed by the patent, or that such a license, if made available to us, could be acquired on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, third parties may, in the future, assert other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our services, technologies or other matters.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on devices in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patents to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patents, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly China and certain other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to medical devices and biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. To date, we have not sought to enforce any issued patents in these foreign jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce, which could result in third parties using our intellectual property to compete against us.\nAlthough we believe that we take reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure of confidential information to third parties, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them, the agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Although we seek to enter into these types of agreements with our contractors, consultants, advisors and research collaborators, to the extent that employees and consultants utilize or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise as to the intellectual property rights associated with our technology. If a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party. In addition, enforcement of our rights can be costly and unpredictable. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u00b7 these agreements may be breached;\n\u00b7 these agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach;\n\u00b7 our proprietary know-how will otherwise become known; or\n\u00b7 our competitors will independently develop similar technology or proprietary information.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. In addition, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that an employee who receives a patent or contributes to an invention during his employment may be allowed to seek compensation for such contributions from his or her employer, even if the employee\u2019s contract of employment specifically states otherwise and the employee has transferred all intellectual property rights to the employer. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the fact that a contract revokes an employee\u2019s right for royalties and compensation, does not rule out the right of the employee to claim their right for royalties. As a result, it is unclear whether and, if so, to what extent our employees may be able to claim compensation with respect to our future revenue. We may receive less revenue from future products if any of our employees successfully claim for compensation for their work in developing our intellectual property, which in turn could impact our future profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe face intense competition in the self-monitoring of blood glucose market, and as a result we may be unable to effectively compete in our industry.\nWith our first product, Dario\u2122, we compete directly and primarily with large pharmaceutical and medical device companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Bayer Healthcare Division, Johnson & Johnson LifeScan, Roche Diagnostics and Sanofi. The first four of these companies have more than 90% combined market share of the BGMS business and strong research and development capacity for next generation products. Their dominant market position since the late 1990s and significant control over the market could significantly limit our ability to introduce Dario\u2122 or effectively market and generate sales of the product. We will also compete with numerous second-tier and third-tier competitors.\nWe only recently commenced sales of our products, and most of our competitors have long histories and strong reputations within the industry. They have significantly greater brand recognition, financial and human resources than we do. They also have more experience and capabilities in researching and developing testing devices, obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances and other requirements, manufacturing and marketing those products than we do. There is a significant risk that we may be unable to overcome the advantages held by our competition, and our inability to do so could lead to the failure of our business and the loss of your investment.\nCompetition in the BGMS markets is extremely intense, which can lead to, among other things, price reductions, longer selling cycles, lower product margins, loss of market share and additional working capital requirements. To succeed, we must, among other critical matters, gain consumer acceptance for Dario\u2122 and potential future devices incorporating our principal technology and offer better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of other competitors. If our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products, we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Moreover, any broad-based changes to our prices and pricing policies could make it difficult to generate revenues or cause our revenues, if established, to decline. Some of our competitors may bundle certain software products offering competing applications for diabetes management at low prices for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy. These practices could significantly reduce demand for Dario\u2122 or potential future products or constrain prices we can charge. Moreover, if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective or desirable than Dario\u2122 or the other products that we may develop, we may not convince our customers to use our products. Any such changes would likely reduce our commercial opportunity and revenue potential and could materially adversely impact our operating results.\nIf we fail to respond quickly to technological developments our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete.\nThe BGMS market and other markets in which we plan to compete experience rapid technology developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to respond quickly to these developments, we may lose competitive position, and Dario\u2122 or any other device or technology may become uncompetitive or obsolete, causing revenues and operating results to suffer. In order to compete, we must develop or acquire new devices and improve our existing device on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum and designers and designer expertise in our industries. We must also be able to support a range of changing customer preferences. For instance, as non-invasive technologies become more readily available in the market, we may be required to adopt our platform to accommodate the use of non-invasive or continuous blood glucose sensors. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any manner in these efforts.\nIf third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of Dario\u2122, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nIn the United States and in other jurisdictions such as Germany and England, we expect that Dario\u2122\u2019s test strips should generally be available for full or partial patient reimbursement by third-party payers. Our success in marketing Dario\u2122 depends and will depend in large part on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of our products.\nIn the United States, we expect to derive nearly all our sales from sales of Dario\u2122 from direct to consumer cash sales as well as retail pharmacy and DME distributors who typically bill various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations, to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with Dario\u2122 and bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) procedures using Dario\u2122 (and our other products in development) by third-party payors is essential to the acceptance of our products by our customers.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. For example, the governmental healthcare system in the Netherlands, New Zealand and Israel have not yet approved reimbursement of Dario\u2122. In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. If sufficient coverage and reimbursement is not available for our current or future products, in either the United States or internationally, the demand for our products and our revenues will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Israel\nPotential political, economic and military instability in the State of Israel, where our management team and our research and development facilities are located, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operating subsidiary, along with our management team and our research and development facilities, is located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business and operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations. The hostilities involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Our offices, located in Caesarea, Israel, are within the range of the missiles and rockets that have been fired at Israeli cities and towns from Gaza sporadically since 2006, with escalations in violence (such as the recent escalation in July 2014) during which there were a substantially larger number of rocket and missile attacks aimed at Israel. In addition, since February 2011, Egypt has experienced political turbulence and an increase in terrorist activity in the Sinai Peninsula. Such political turbulence and violence may damage peaceful and diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt, and could affect the region as a whole. Similar civil unrest and political turbulence has occurred in other countries in the region, including Syria which shares a common border with Israel, and is affecting the political stability of those countries. This instability and any outside intervention may lead to deterioration of the political and economic relationships that exist between the State of Israel and some of these countries, and may have the potential for causing additional conflicts in the region. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various rebel militia groups in Syria. Additionally, a violent jihadist group named Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) is involved in hostilities in Iraq and Syria and have been growing in influence. Although ISIL\u2019s activities have not directly affected the political and economic conditions in Israel, ISIL\u2019s stated purpose is to take control of the Middle East, including Israel. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business may decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. Further, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nFurther, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to an economic boycott. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business.\nOur operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of Israeli citizens to perform military service.\nMany Israeli citizens are obligated to perform several days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-ups, which may include the call-up of members of our management. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInvestors may have difficulties enforcing a U.S. judgment, including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, against us, or our executive officers and directors or asserting U.S. securities laws claims in Israel.\nCertain of our directors and officers are not residents of the United States and whose assets may be located outside the United States. Service of process upon us or our non-U.S. resident directors and officers and enforcement of judgments obtained in the United States against us or our non-U.S. our directors and executive officers may be difficult to obtain within the United States. We have been informed by our legal counsel in Israel that it may be difficult to assert claims under U.S. securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel or obtain a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws against us or our officers and directors because Israel may not be the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. Israeli courts might not enforce judgments rendered outside Israel, which may make it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us or our officers and directors.\nMoreover, among other reasons, including but not limited to, fraud or absence of due process, or the existence of a judgment which is at variance with another judgment that was given in the same matter if a suit in the same matter between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel, an Israeli court will not enforce a foreign judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts (subject to exceptional cases) or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the State of Israel.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock and Warrants\nOur officers, directors and founding stockholders may exert significant influence over our affairs, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, our officers, directors and affiliated stockholders (including Dicilyon Consulting and Investment Ltd., or Dicilyon, an affiliate of David Edery, and OurCrowd Digital Health, L.P.) collectively have an approximately 44.7% beneficial ownership of our company. As a result, such individuals will have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from those individuals. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our company.\nOurCrowd Digital Health L.P. has the right to appoint up to two members of our Board of Directors, which affords such investor the potential for control over our business.\nOurCrowd Digital Health L.P., an investor that participated in our January 2017 private placement transaction, has the right, for so long as such investor holds 13% and 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, to appoint, respectively, two or one member of our Board of Directors. To date, such investor has appointed two members of our Board of Directors (Allen Kamer and Yossi Bahagon). As a result, such investor has significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors which, in turn, affords such investor the potential for material control over our business.\nOur common stock has less liquidity than many other stocks listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nHistorically, the trading volume of our common stock has been relatively low when compared to larger companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market or other stock exchanges. While we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock during the year ended December 31, 2016, we cannot say with certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock or warrants adversely, the price of our common stock or warrants and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock or warrants may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock or warrants adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock or warrants would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock or warrants or trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock and warrants may be significantly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock and warrants may be significantly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u00b7 conditions in markets generally;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u00b7 general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn particular, the market prices for securities of mHealth and medical device have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock and warrants to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 any delay in or the results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 any delay in manufacturing of our products;\n\u00b7 any delay with the approval for reimbursement for the patients from their insurance companies;\n\u00b7 our failure to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the announcements of clinical trial data, and the investment community\u2019s perception of and reaction to those data;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials conducted by others on products that would compete with ours;\n\u00b7 any delay or failure to receive clearance or approval from regulatory agencies or bodies;\n\u00b7 our inability to commercially launch products or market and generate sales of our products, including Dario\u2122;\n\u00b7 failure of Dario\u2122 or any other products, even if approved for marketing, to achieve any level of commercial success;\n\u00b7 our failure to obtain patent protection for any of our technologies and products (including those related to Dario\u2122) or the issuance of third party patents that cover our proposed technologies or products;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our product\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 our or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u00b7 general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our expenditures;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents;\n\u00b7 failure to adequately manufacture Dario\u2122 or any other products through third parties;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock or other securities, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or otherwise issued pursuant to certain contractual rights;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u00b7 low or high trading volume of our common stock due to many factors, including the terms of our financing arrangements.\nIn addition, if we fail to reach an important research, development or commercialization milestone or result by a publicly expected deadline, even if by only a small margin, there could be significant impact on the market price of our common stock and warrants. Additionally, as we approach the announcement of anticipated significant information and as we announce such information, we expect the price of our common stock and warrants to be particularly volatile, and negative results would have a substantial negative impact on the price of our common stock and warrants.\nIn some cases, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our business operations and reputation.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock and warrants.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period: (i) affiliated stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii) non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale report may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nThe right of the lead investor in our January 2017 Private Placement to participate in future financings of ours could impair our ability to raise capital.\nUnder the securities purchase agreement with the lead investor in our January 2017 private placement offering, in the event that we seek to raise money through the offer and sale of debt or equity securities, we must first offer such investor a right to participate in at least 13% of the securities we propose to offer in such funding. The existence of such right of participation, or the exercise of such rights, may deter potential investors from providing us needed financing, or may deter investment banks from working with, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our company which, in turn, could lead to our inability to continue our business.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave our stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u00b7 taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nBecause we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. While we are not currently delaying the implementation of any relevant accounting standards, in the future we may avail ourselves of this rights, and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nOur compliance with complicated U.S. regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure is expensive. Moreover, our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is uncertain given our management\u2019s relative inexperience with operating U.S. public companies.\nAs a publicly reporting company, we are faced with expensive and complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and, to the extent we complete our anticipated public offering, the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards of a U.S. public company are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, our executive officers have little experience in operating a U.S. public company, which makes our ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations uncertain. Our failure to company with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock and warrants.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u00b7 provide that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and/or President or other executive officer, our Board of Directors or a super-majority (66 2/3%) of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 place restrictive requirements (including advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals) on how special meetings of stockholders may be called by our stockholders;\n\u00b7 do not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u00b7 provide that our Board of Directors or a super-majority of our stockholders (66 2/3%) may amend our bylaws.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 15961, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "DRIO"}
