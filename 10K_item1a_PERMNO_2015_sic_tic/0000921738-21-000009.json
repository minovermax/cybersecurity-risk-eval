The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States. The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, complex and rapidly evolving, with governments, public institutions, and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, social distancing and health and safety guidelines, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings, and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences, and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have also dramatically reduced travel and demand for casino gaming and related amenities. Many jurisdictions where our properties are located required mandatory closures or imposed capacity limitations, health and safety guidelines and other restrictions affecting our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and these resulting developments caused significant disruptions to our ability to generate revenues, profitability, and cash flows and had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time. In addition, these disruptions to us and the gaming industry in general as well as significant negative economic trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our stock price.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, all of the Company\u2019s properties were closed pursuant to various orders from state gaming regulatory bodies or governmental authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19. We began reopening our properties on May 18, 2020 with reduced gaming and hotel capacity and limited food and beverage offerings in order to accommodate comprehensive social distancing and health and safety protocols. As of June 30, 2020, we had reopened 31 of our properties and as of September 30, 2020, we had reopened 39 of our properties. During the fourth quarter of 2020, our properties in Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania again temporarily suspended operations and as of December 31, 2020, we had reopened 34 of our properties. As of February 26, 2021, the only properties that remain closed are Zia Park and Valley Race Park.\nThough virtually all of our properties have reopened, we may be required again to temporarily suspend operations at our properties if ordered by such governmental bodies. Our reopened properties face restrictions on our operations, including hours of operations, capacity limitations, cleaning requirements, restrictions on the number of seats per table game, slot machine spacing, temperature checks, mask protection and social distancing requirements and food and beverage options, which impact our future operations and ability to generate the same level of revenues and cash flows as before the COVID-19 pandemic. The continued operation of our reopened properties, may be affected by our ability to retain our workforce.\nMoreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear how quickly customers will return to our properties in numbers comparable to before the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be a function of continued concerns over health and safety, ongoing social distancing measures, perceptions of the efficacy of any vaccines and the ability to achieve herd immunity, or changes in consumer spending behavior due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses. Our properties have large customer-facing footprints and large areas where customers can gather together for personal interaction. As such, some customers may choose for a period of time not to travel or visit our properties for health and safety concerns or due to overall changes in consumer behavior resulting from social distancing. Upon reopening our properties, we have seen weakened visitation, which may have been due to increased level of unemployment, continued travel restrictions or warnings, consumer fears, reduced consumer discretionary spending or general economic uncertainty. Our vendors and other suppliers could also experience potential adverse effects of the pandemic that could impact our ability to operate to the same level as prior to the closures. Cancellations, delays or shortened sports seasons and sporting events due to the COVID-19 pandemic have also had an adverse impact on the revenues of our sports betting operations. If COVID-19 continues to spread significantly in its current form or as a more contagious variant of the virus, governmental agencies or officials may order additional closures or impose further restrictions on the number of people allowed in our properties or in proximity to each other. Any of these events could result in significant further disruption to our operations and a drop in demand for our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe could experience other potential adverse impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, further charges from adjustments to the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, or impairments of investments in joint ventures.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (including how long the current resurgence may last, and whether there will be multiple resurgences in the future); the duration and impact on overall customer demand; the possibility that governmental bodies may again order temporary suspension of operation at our properties; our ability to again generate revenue and profits capable of supporting our ongoing operations; new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 or variants of the virus, or the efficacy of, or adverse reactions to, vaccines; the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity; the ability of us and our business partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses, and individuals continue to take in response to the pandemic, including limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure, casino, and entertainment activities (including concerts, sports and similar events); and how quickly economies, travel activity, and demand for gaming, entertainment and leisure activities recovers after the pandemic subsides and an effective vaccine is widely available. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration, and impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe face significant competition in the markets in which we operate and from other gaming and entertainment operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants operating from physical locations and/or through online or mobile platforms, and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Recently, there has been additional significant competition in our markets as a result of the upgrading or expansion of properties by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes permitting additional forms of gaming. As competing properties and new markets open, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. We expect each existing or future market in which we participate to be highly competitive.\nFurthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms could divert customers from our properties and our online sports betting and iGaming apps and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker, sports betting and other varieties of iGaming in a number of states. Several states have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate iGaming and iGaming operations have begun or will begin in these states. Further, there has been recent expansion of sports betting in various states, as states have passed legislation legalizing sports betting in casinos and/or online. Expansion of land-based and iGaming in other jurisdictions (both regulated and unregulated) could further compete with our traditional and iGaming operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans and as well as various land taken into trust for the benefit of certain First Nations people in Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations (including VGTs, skill games, sports betting and iGaming). Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments or fill COVID-related budget gaps by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states, in which we operate or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties. New, relocated, or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe may face reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of economic downturns (including as a result of COVID-19) which have had a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur net revenues are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at properties we manage, and as such, our business has been adversely impacted by economic downturns in the past and continues to be impacted by the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries from recessions, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness in the housing market, cultural and demographic changes, high fuel or other transportation costs, and increased stock market volatility have negatively impacted our revenues and operating cash flow.\nWe have certain properties that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of these properties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 16.7%, 10.7%, and 15.6% of our revenues from our properties within the states of Louisiana, Missouri, and Ohio, respectively. Additionally, we generated 6.6% of our revenues from our property in Charles Town, West Virginia. Our ability to meet our operating and debt service requirements is dependent, in part, upon the continued success of these properties.\nIn addition, we anticipate meaningful contributions from Ameristar Black Hawk, Greektown, and our properties in Pennsylvania. Therefore, our results will be dependent on the regional economies and competitive landscapes at these locations as well.\nWe are required to utilize a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make our rent payments under our Triple Net Leases, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nWe are required to utilize a significant portion of our cash flow from operations which was $891.1 million inclusive of rent credits utilized for the year ended December 31, 2020, to make our rent payments pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of our Master Leases with GLPI, our Meadows Lease and Morgantown Lease with GLPI, our Margaritaville Lease\nand Greektown Lease with VICI and our Tropicana Lease (as defined previously as our \u201cTriple Net Leases\u201d), although cash rent under our Tropicana Lease is nominal. In 2020, all of our properties were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 and we were able to obtain rent credits of $337.5 million from GLPI in order to maintain compliance with our Master Leases with GLPI in connection with the sale of Tropicana and the real estate associated with Morgantown. As a result of these commitments under our Triple Net Leases, our ability to fund our own operations or development projects, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. Further, our obligations under the Triple Net Leases may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness and restrict our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions. Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMost of our facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property.\nWe lease 36 of the facilities we operate, or plan to operate, pursuant to the Triple Net Leases. Termination of the Penn Master Lease, Pinnacle Master Lease, Morgantown Lease or Tropicana Lease could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, as a lessee, we do not completely control the land and improvements underlying our operations, and our landlords under the Triple Net Leases could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the facilities leased under the Triple Net Leases that are beyond our control. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our obligations under the Triple Net Leases in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that our landlords will be able to comply with their obligations under the Triple Net Leases with us. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable, we could remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Triple Net Leases even if we decided to withdraw from those locations.\nInclement weather, acts or threats of terrorism, and other casualty events could seriously disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe operations of our properties are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters, acts or threats of terrorism, concerns about contagious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other casualty events, such as hurricanes or tornados. We maintain significant property insurance, including business interruption coverage, for these and other properties. However, there can be no assurances that we will be fully, promptly, or compensated at all for losses at any of our properties in the event of future inclement weather or casualty events or from the closings of our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other contagious disease. For example, on August 27, 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall in Lake Charles, Louisiana and caused significant damage to L\u2019Auberge Lake Charles forcing it to close for approximately two weeks.\nOur operations could be disrupted if management agreements and/or leases with third parties and local governments are not renewed.\nOur operations in several jurisdictions depend on land leases and/or management and development agreements with third parties and local governments. If we, or if GLPI or VICI in the case of leases pursuant to which we are the sub-lessee, are unable to renew these leases and agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire or if disputes arise regarding the terms of these agreements, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\nA majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines and related systems operated by us at our gaming properties. A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector in recent years. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines, which could hurt our profitability.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or generate sufficient returns on our recently expanded sports betting operations and investment in Barstool Sports.\nCertain of the jurisdictions in which we operate have legalized intra-state sports wagering and have established extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements governing any such intra-state sports wagering. Our sports betting operations compete, and will continue to compete, in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors. We launched the Barstool Sportsbook app in Pennsylvania in September 2020 and in Michigan in January 2021, and we expect to launch our Barstool Sportsbook app in additional states throughout 2021. In addition, we have entered into certain market access agreements with certain other sports betting operators and may enter into agreements with additional strategic partners and other third-party vendors. The success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States; our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market; the timeliness and the technological and popular viability of our products; our ability to compete with new entrants in the market; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; cancellations and delays in sporting seasons and sporting events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that our expansion will be successful and generate sufficient returns on our investment.\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected benefits or financial returns of our investment in Barstool Sports due to fees, costs, taxes, delays or disruptions in connection with our roll out of our online and retail sportsbooks, the Barstool Sportsbook app, and iGaming products. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Barstool Sports audience will engage in sports betting and iGaming products to the extent that we expect. Any of the factors above could prevent us from receiving the expected returns of our investment in Barstool Sports, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur investment in and partnership with Barstool Sports may result in potential adverse reactions, negative publicity or changes to our business or regulatory relationships. Our relationships with state gaming regulators and business partners could be adversely affected as a result of our affiliation with Barstool Sports. Gaming regulators may not have extensive experience in the digital media industry, which may present unique challenges in regulating our business. In addition, our business partners may react negatively to actual or perceived competitive threats from our affiliation with Barstool Sports.\nOur operations and the success of our investment in Barstool Sports are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\nOur success and our competitive position are largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. Although we enter into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives and key personnel, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel. Further, Barstool Sports is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain key personnel, including content creators, bloggers, and marketing personnel. If Barstool Sports loses the services of its senior management team or other key personnel, or if there is a shortage in the availability of the requisite qualified personnel, it would limit the ability of Barstool Sports to grow, to increase sales, and promote our online sports betting and iGaming products and our gaming facilities.\nWork stoppages, organizing drives, and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nSome of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.\nFurther, there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets. In addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor, the continued expansion of gaming near our properties, including the expansion of Native American gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals. While we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result.\nWe depend on agreements with our horsemen and pari-mutuel clerks, which if we fail to renew or modify on satisfactory terms, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn jurisdictions where we operate pari-mutuel wagering, if we fail to present evidence of an agreement with the horsemen at a track, we may not be permitted to conduct live racing and to export and import simulcasting at that track and OTWs and, in West Virginia, our video lottery license may not be renewed.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain-name-protection laws to protect our proprietary rights. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In any of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on the stock price or trading volume of our common stock.\nThe U.S. securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years, including recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business (particularly in the case of class actions). As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in these lawsuits, and, especially with increasing class action claims in our industry, litigation could result in costs, settlements, or damages that could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had indebtedness of $2,431.6 million, including $1,628.1 million in outstanding term loans. In addition, we are required to make significant annual lease payments to our REIT Landlords pursuant to the Triple Net Leases, which we currently expect will be approximately $814.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2021.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and significant fixed annual lease payments under the Triple Net Leases. Our substantial indebtedness and additional fixed costs under our Lease obligations could have important consequences to our financial health.\nAs noted above, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our gaming properties had been temporarily closed. The closure of our gaming properties had significantly disrupted our ability to generate revenues. In order to remain in compliance with our debt covenants and meet our payment obligations, on April 14, 2020, we entered into an agreement to amend our Amended Credit Agreement to provide temporary relief from our financial covenants. In addition, our substantial indebtedness could result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt.\nIn addition, the interest rates of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021 (\u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, which may impact our Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe lack of availability and cost of financing could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe intend to finance some of our current and future expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and equity or debt financings. If we are\nunable to finance our current or future projects, we could have to seek alternative financing. Depending on credit market conditions, alternative sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, development and/or renovation, or such other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion, development and renovation projects and acquisitions, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in 2023, is $700.0 million. There is no certainty that our lenders will continue to remain solvent or fund their respective obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including with respect to our indebtedness. We also may incur indebtedness related to properties we develop or acquire in the future prior to generating cash flow from those properties. If those properties do not provide us with cash flow to service that indebtedness (including as a result of COVID-19), we will need to rely on cash flow from our other properties, which would increase our leverage. In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase significantly.\nRisks Related to Regulation, Taxes and Compliance\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs owners and managers of casino gaming, online gaming, sports betting, video lottery, VGTs, and pari-mutuel wagering operations, we are subject to extensive state and local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in us. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, for instance, hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of slot machines and table games. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against us, our subsidiaries, or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations and/or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits, and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing gaming and pari-mutuel properties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and renew those existing licenses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any new licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful. Furthermore, this risk is particularly pertinent to our iGaming or sports betting initiatives because regulations in this area are not as fully developed or established.\nGaming authorities in the U.S. generally can require that any record or beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a license or similar finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner\u2019s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.\nOur directors, officers, key employees, and joint venture partners must also meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities. If state gaming regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture partner or one of our vendors unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the joint\nventure partner or vendor. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees, joint venture partners or vendors to ensure compliance with applicable standards.\nCertain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions that we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities.\nChanges in legislation and regulation of our business could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRegulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial, competitive or other burdens on the way we conduct our business.\nIn particular, certain areas of law governing new gaming activities, such as the federal and state law applicable to iGaming and sports betting, are new or developing in light of emerging technologies. New and developing areas of law may be subject to the interpretation of the government agencies tasked with enforcing them. In some circumstances, a government agency may interpret a statute or regulation in one manner and then reconsider its interpretation at a later date. No assurance can be provided that government agencies will interpret or enforce new or developing areas of law consistently, predictably, or favorably. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nState and local smoking restrictions have and may continue to negatively affect our business.\nLegislation in various forms to ban or substantially curtail indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe the smoking restrictions have significantly impacted business volumes. If additional smoking restrictions are enacted within jurisdictions where we operate or seek to do business, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nMaterial increases to our taxes or the adoption of new taxes or the authorization of new or increased forms of gaming could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nWe believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit or expand legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time-to-time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes, property taxes and/or by authorizing additional gaming properties each subject to payment of a new license fee. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in such laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming or new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any new or increased gaming or the material increase or adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, especially in light of our significant fixed rent payments.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities which could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition\nof other liabilities or restrictions. From time to time, we have incurred and are incurring costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters. The extent of such potential conditions cannot be determined definitively. To date, none of these matters have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of the property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. Under our contractual arrangements under the Triple Net Leases, we will generally be responsible for both past and future environmental liabilities associated with our gaming operations, notwithstanding ownership of the underlying real property having been transferred. Furthermore, we are aware that there is or may have been soil or groundwater or other contamination at certain of our properties resulting from current or former operations. These environmental conditions may require remediation in isolated areas. The extent of such potential conditions cannot be determined definitely, and may result in additional expense in the event that additional or currently unknown conditions are detected.\nAdditionally, certain of the gaming chips used at many gaming properties, including some of ours, have been found to contain some level of lead. Analysis by third parties has indicated the normal handling of the chips does not create a health hazard. We have disposed of a majority of these gaming chips. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and other regulations, and if we fail to comply with such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally. The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds, in response to which we have implemented Know Your Customer processes. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry, and public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests. Further, since we deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations, we are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations, or any accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money laundering activities, by any of our properties, employees, partners, affiliates, or customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe riverboats on which we operate must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel, and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. The casino barges on which we operate also must meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of the gaming facilities on which we operate were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, construction, land use, employment, marketing, and advertising and the production, sale and service of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations or we are subject to a substantial penalty, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects may adversely impact our operations.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate.\nWe may become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, stockholders and nongovernmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Many states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions and in the past federal legislation has been proposed in Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance, or ability to compete. Further, regulation of GHG emissions may limit our guests\u2019 ability to travel to our properties as a result of increased fuel costs or restrictions on transport related emissions. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We have described the risks to us associated with extreme weather events in the risk factors above.\nRisks Related to Technology, Information Security, and Penn Interactive\nOur gaming operations, online sports betting and iGaming rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power.\nAny unscheduled disruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations (including slot machines and security systems), online sports betting, and iGaming operations.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk, including misappropriation of employee information, customer information or other breaches of information security, particularly as our iGaming division grows.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology and other systems (particularly as our iGaming division grows), including our own systems and those of service providers and third parties, to manage our business and employee data and maintain and transmit customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists, and reservations information. Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and we have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply by implementing processes designed to safeguard the confidential and personal information of our business, employees and customers. In addition, our security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly. However, our information and processes and those of our service providers and other third parties, are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate the risks of breaches may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, disclosures, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures or investigate or remediate any vulnerability. Increased instances of cyber-attacks may also have a negative reputational impact on us and our properties that may result in a loss of customer confidence and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur online sports betting and iGaming initiatives may result in increased risk of cyber-attack, hacking, or other security breaches, which could harm our reputation and competitive position and which could result in regulatory actions against us or in other penalties.\nAs our online sports betting and iGaming business grows, we will face increased cyber risks and threats that seek to damage, disrupt or gain access to our networks, our products and services, and supporting infrastructure. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risk could result in interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, and cause our users to lose confidence in our products. The unauthorized access, acquisition or disclosure of consumer information could compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and substantial legal and financial liability. This could harm our business and reputation, disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position.\nIf our third-party mobile application distribution platforms or service providers do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon third-party distribution platforms, including the Apple App Store and Google Play store, for distribution of our mobile applications. As such, the promotion, distribution and operation of our mobile applications are subject to the respective distribution platforms\u2019 standard terms and policies, which are very broad and subject to frequent changes and interpretation. If Apple or Google choose to de-list any of our mobile applications due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a material negative impact on our business.\nFurther, the success of Penn Interactive depends in part on our relationships with other third-party service providers for content delivery, load balancing and protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks. If those providers do not perform adequately or terminate their relationship with us, our users may experience issues or interruptions with their experiences. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners could adversely affect our reputation and brand.\nWe also incorporate technology from third parties into our platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we rely on third-party geolocation and identity verification systems to ensure we are in compliance with certain laws and regulations. There is no guarantee that the third-party geolocation and identity verification systems will perform adequately, or be effective, and any service disruption to those systems would prohibit us from operating our platform, and would adversely affect our business.\nThe growth of Penn Interactive will depend on our ability to attract and retain users.\nOur ability to achieve growth in revenue in the future in Penn Interactive and Barstool Sports sports betting app will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new users to our offerings, retain existing users of our offerings and reactivate users in a cost-effective manner. Achieving growth in our community of users may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales and marketing and promotional efforts, which may not make sense in terms of return on investment. We have used and expect to continue to use a variety of free and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers and exciting games to achieve our objectives. For paid marketing, we intend to leverage a broad array of advertising channels, including television, radio, social media influencers (brand ambassadors), social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snap, affiliates and paid and organic search, and other digital channels, such as mobile display. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms, change their terms around gaming, or if the prices at which we may purchase listings increase, then our costs could increase, and fewer users may click through to our website. If links to our website are not displayed prominently in online search results, if fewer users click through to our website, if our other digital marketing campaigns are not effective, if the costs of attracting users using any of our current methods significantly increase, then our ability to efficiently attract new users could be reduced, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn addition, our ability to increase the number of users of our offerings will depend on continued user adoption of the Barstool Sportsbook app and iGaming. Growth in the sportsbook and iGaming industries and the level of demand for and market acceptance of our product offerings will be subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We cannot assure that consumer adoption of our product offerings will continue or exceed current growth rates, or that the industry will achieve more widespread acceptance.\nAdditionally, as technological or regulatory standards change and we modify our platform to comply with those standards, we may need users to take certain actions to continue playing, such as performing age verification checks or accepting new terms and conditions. Users may stop using our product offerings at any time, including if the quality of the user experience on our platform, including our support capabilities in the event of a problem, does not meet their expectations or keep pace with the quality of the customer experience generally offered by competitive offerings.\nWe face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded gaming properties or launching new iGaming or sports betting channels, which may lead to increased costs and delays in anticipated revenues.\nNo assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded gaming properties or launch new iGaming or sports betting channels, the expected timetables for opening such properties or channels will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. In\naddition, as we seek to launch iGaming and sports betting apps in additional states, we will need to hire additional qualified employees, such as engineers, IT professionals and other compliance personnel. Given the significant competition in this area for qualified candidates, we may be unable to hire qualified candidates. Delays in opening new or upgraded properties could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such properties or channels and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNegative events or negative media coverage relating to, or a declining popularity of, sports betting, the underlying sports or athletes, online sports betting, or iGaming may adversely impact our ability to retain or attract users, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nPublic opinion can significantly influence our business. Unfavorable publicity regarding us or regarding the actions of third parties with whom we have relationships or the underlying sports (including declining popularity of the sports or athletes) could seriously harm our reputation. In addition, a negative shift in the perception of sports betting and iGaming by the public or by politicians, lobbyists or others could affect future legislation of sports betting and iGaming. Negative public perception could also lead to new restrictions on or to the prohibition of iGaming or sports betting in jurisdictions in which we currently operate. Such negative publicity could also adversely affect the size, demographics, engagement, and loyalty of our customer base and result in decreased revenue or slower user growth rates, which could seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing properties or other initiatives we have recently acquired, may develop, or may acquire in the future.\nWe could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive markets. The integration of more significant properties that we may develop or acquire (such as Morgantown, Perryville, and York) will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. In addition, development and integration of new information technology systems that may be required is costly and time-consuming. The process of integrating properties that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, local opposition, regulatory, legal and competitive risks as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities. In particular, in projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or if our relationships otherwise deteriorate, we could face significant increased costs and delays. Local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project. Many of these same risks apply to our iGaming and sports betting initiatives. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license opportunities, litigation is possible.\nManagement of new properties, especially in new geographic areas and business lines may require that we increase our management resources or divert the attention of our current management. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or development projects. We also cannot assure you that if acquisitions are completed, that the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations.\nOur ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior level property management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of some or all of the above described events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn the event we make another acquisition, we may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete, or other delays or impediments to completing, such acquisition.\nOur growth is fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming, racing, and development properties, as well as our iGaming and sports betting initiatives. In addition to standard closing conditions, our acquisitions are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly reduce the benefits to us of such acquisitions and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nIf the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nWe received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off under Section 355, and we received from our tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that, with respect to such requirements on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements will be satisfied. The IRS Ruling, and the tax opinions that we received from our tax advisors, relied on and will rely on, among other things, certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of GLPI\u2019s business, and the IRS Ruling and the opinions would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect.\nNotwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine the Spin-Off should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS Ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling. If the Spin-Off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the GLPI common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that GLPI entered into with us, GLPI generally is required to indemnify us against any tax resulting from the Spin-Off to the extent that such tax resulted from (1) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of GLPI, whether by merger or otherwise, (2) other actions or failures to act by GLPI, or (3) any of GLPI\u2019s representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated. GLPI\u2019s indemnification obligations to Penn and its subsidiaries, officers and directors will not be limited by any maximum amount. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn or such other persons under the circumstance set forth in the tax matters agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities and there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, GLPI agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that GLPI\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, GLPI has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that GLPI agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from GLPI any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from GLPI.\nA court could deem the distribution in the Spin-Off to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the transaction or impose substantial liabilities upon us.\nIf the transaction is challenged by a third-party, a court could deem the distribution of GLPI common shares or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the Spin-Off to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. In such circumstances, a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require our shareholders to return to us some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of creditors. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.\nIf we and GLPI are treated by the IRS as being under common control, both we and GLPI could experience adverse tax consequences.\nIf we and GLPI are treated by the IRS as being under common control, the IRS will be authorized to reallocate income and deductions between us and GLPI to reflect arm\u2019s length terms. If the IRS were to successfully establish that rents paid by us to\nGLPI are excessive, we would be (i) denied a deduction for the excessive portion and (ii) subject to a penalty on the portion deemed excessive, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Also, our shareholders would be deemed to have received a distribution that was then contributed to the capital of GLPI.", "PERMNO": 80563, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "PENN"}
