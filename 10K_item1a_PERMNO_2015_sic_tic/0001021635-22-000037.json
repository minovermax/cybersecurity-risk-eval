{"cik": "1021635", "company": "OGE ENERGY CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the discussion of risk factors set forth below, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to the Registrants. In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by us and/or our subsidiaries with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating OGE Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us or our subsidiaries. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nThe Registrants are subject to a variety of risks which can be classified as regulatory, operational, financial and general. Risk factors of OG&E are also risk factors of OGE Energy. OGE Energy also is subject to risks associated with its investment in Energy Transfer's equity securities.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nThe Registrants' profitability depends to a large extent on the ability of OG&E to fully recover its costs, including its cost of capital, from its customers in a timely manner, and there may be changes in the regulatory environment that impair its ability to recover costs from its customers.\nOG&E is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences its operating environment and its ability to fully recover its costs, including its cost of capital, from utility customers. Recoverability of any under recovered amounts from OG&E's customers due to a rise in fuel costs is a significant risk, such as experienced in February 2021 due to Winter Storm Uri that resulted in winter record winter peak demand for electricity in OG&E's service territory and extreme natural gas and purchased power prices. The utility commissions in the states where OG&E operates regulate many aspects of its utility operations including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that OG&E can charge customers. The profitability of the utility operations is dependent on OG&E's ability to fully recover costs related to providing energy and utility services to its customers in a timely manner. Any failure to obtain utility commission approval to increase rates to fully recover costs, or a delay in the receipt of such approval, could have an adverse impact on OG&E's results of operations. In addition, OG&E's jurisdictions have fuel adjustment clauses that permit OG&E to recover fuel costs through rates without a general rate review, subject to a later determination that such fuel costs were prudently incurred. If the state regulatory commissions determine that the fuel costs were not prudently incurred, recovery could be disallowed. See Note 16 within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of the significant fuel and purchased power costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri and the related regulatory filings with the OCC and the APC, including the securitization filing approved by the OCC in December 2021.\nIn recent years, the regulatory environments in which OG&E operates have received an increased amount of attention. It is possible that there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair OG&E's ability to fully recover costs historically paid by OG&E's customers. State utility commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. OG&E cannot assure that the OCC, APSC and the FERC will grant rate increases in the future or in the amounts requested, and they could instead lower OG&E's rates.\nThe Registrants are unable to predict the impact on their operating results from future regulatory activities of any of the agencies that regulate OG&E. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on the Registrants' results of operations.\nOG&E's rates are subject to rate regulation by the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as by a federal agency, whose regulatory paradigms and goals may not be consistent.\nOG&E is a vertically integrated electric utility. Most of its revenue results from the sale of electricity to retail customers subject to bundled rates that are approved by the applicable state utility commission.\nOG&E operates in Oklahoma and western Arkansas and is subject to rate regulation by the OCC and the APSC, in addition to FERC regulation of its transmission activities and any wholesale sales. Exposure to inconsistent state and federal regulatory standards may limit our ability to operate profitably. Further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate, including a change in our authorized return on equity, may harm our financial position and results of operations.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production of electricity and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.\nIn response to recent regulatory and judicial decisions and international accords, emissions of greenhouse gases including, most significantly, CO2, could be restricted in the future as a result of federal or state legal requirements or litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions. No rules are currently in effect that require us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but laws and regulations to which we must adhere change, and the Biden Administration's agenda includes a significant shift in environmental and energy policy, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change issues. Together, these actions reflect climate change issues and greenhouse gas emission reductions as central areas of focus for domestic and international regulations, orders and policies. In addition, a parallel focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is reflected in legislation introduced in Congress. These initiatives could lead to new and revised energy and environmental laws and regulations, including tax reforms relating to energy and environmental issues. Any such changes, as well as any enforcement actions or judicial decisions regarding those laws and regulations, could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Such changes also could affect the manner in which we conduct our business and could require us to make substantial additional capital expenditures or abandon certain projects.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our operations and historical industry practices. These activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that can restrict or impact OG&E's business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way OG&E can handle or dispose of its wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. OG&E may be unable to recover these costs from insurance or other regulatory mechanisms. The Biden Administration has suggested that it will enact stricter laws, regulations and enforcement policies that could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. If regulations are enacted regarding any of our generating units, as listed in \"Item 2. Properties,\" it could potentially result in stranded assets.\nIn addition, we may be required to make significant expenditures in connection with the investigation and remediation of alleged or actual spills, personal injury or property damage claims, and the repair, upgrade or expansion of our facilities to meet future requirements and obligations under environmental laws.\nFor further discussion of environmental matters that may affect the Registrants, see \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" within \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nWe are subject to financial risks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy.\nIn addition to the potential for physical risk related to climate change (discussed below), climate change, and the risks related to our transition to a lower-carbon economy, creates financial risk. Transition risks represent those risks related to the social and economic changes needed to shift toward a lower carbon future. These risks are often interconnected, representing policy and regulatory changes, technology and market risks, and risks to our reputation and financial performance.\nPotential regulation associated with climate change legislation could pose financial risks to OGE Energy and its affiliates. The U.S. is a party to the United Nations' \"Paris Agreement\" on climate change, and the Agreement along with other potential legislation and regulation discussed above, could result in enforceable greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements could lead to increased compliance costs for OGE Energy and its affiliates. For example, the EPA has indicated that it is currently \"evaluating additional opportunities\" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants.\nAs we expand our cleaner energy generation asset mix, the ability to integrate renewable technologies into our operations and maintain reliability and affordability is key. The intermittency of renewables remains a critical challenge particularly as cost-efficient energy storage is still in development. Other technology risks include the need for significant\nupfront financial investments, lengthy development timelines, and the uncertainty of integration and scalability across our entire service territory.\nIn addition, to the extent that any climate change adversely affects the national or regional economic health through physical impacts or increased rates caused by the inclusion of additional regulatory costs, CO2 taxes or imposed costs, OGE Energy and its affiliates may be adversely impacted. There are also increasing risks for energy companies from shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change who may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into entities that emit lower levels of greenhouse gases or into non-energy related sectors. Institutional investors and lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable investing and lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\nIn addition, we may be subject to financial risks from private party litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Defense costs associated with such litigation can be significant and an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. Such payments or expenditures could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial investments in capital improvements and additions.\nOur business plan calls for extensive investments in capital improvements and additions in OG&E, including modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives. Significant portions of OG&E's facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with environmental requirements or to provide reliable operations. OG&E currently provides service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates OG&E charges, it would not be able to recover the costs associated with its planned extensive investment. This could adversely affect the Registrants' financial position and results of operations. While OG&E may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of its capital investment, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments.\nThe regional power market in which OG&E operates has changing transmission regulatory structures, which may affect the transmission assets and related revenues and expenses.\nOG&E currently owns and operates transmission and generation facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. OG&E is a member of the SPP regional transmission organization and has transferred operational authority (but not ownership) of OG&E's transmission facilities to the SPP. The SPP has implemented regional day ahead and real-time markets for energy and operating reserves, as well as associated transmission congestion rights. Collectively, the three markets operate together under the global name, SPP Integrated Marketplace. OG&E represents owned and contracted generation assets and customer load in the SPP Integrated Marketplace for the sole benefit of its customers. OG&E has not participated in the SPP Integrated Marketplace for any speculative trading activities. We record the SPP Integrated Marketplace transactions as sales or purchases with results reported as Revenues from Contracts with Customers or Fuel, Purchased Power and Direct Transmission Expense in its financial statements. Our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities may be adversely affected by changes in the organization, operation and regulation of the SPP Integrated Marketplace by the FERC or the SPP.\nIncreased competition resulting from efforts to restructure utility and energy markets could have a significant financial impact on us and consequently impact our revenue.\nWe have been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility and energy industries. Significant changes have occurred and additional changes have been proposed to the wholesale electric market. Although retail restructuring efforts in Oklahoma and Arkansas have been postponed for the time being, if such efforts were renewed, retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on us due to possible impairments of assets, a loss of retail customers, impact profit margins and/or increased costs of capital. Any such restructuring could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot predict when we will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can we predict the impact of these changes on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to substantial utility and energy regulation by governmental agencies. Compliance with current and future utility and energy regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certifications may result in significant costs to us.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory agencies. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain permits, approvals and certifications from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of our businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices and the operation of generating facilities. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from future regulatory activities of these agencies.\nThe NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability and cyber security standards for the wholesale electric power system. OG&E's plan is to comply with all applicable standards and to expediently correct a violation should it occur. As one of OG&E's regulators, the NERC has comprehensive regulations and standards related to the reliability and security of our operating systems and is continuously developing additional mandatory compliance requirements for the utility industry. The increasing development of NERC rules and standards will increase compliance costs and our exposure for potential violations of these standards.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur results of operations may be impacted by disruptions to fuel supply or the electric grid that are beyond our control.\nWe are exposed to risks related to performance of contractual obligations by our suppliers. We are dependent on coal and natural gas for much of our electric generating capacity. We rely on suppliers to deliver coal and natural gas in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. We have certain supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal and natural gas to us. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal and natural gas to us under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. Deliveries may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to various factors, including transportation problems, weather, availability of equipment and labor shortages. Failure or delay by our suppliers of coal and natural gas deliveries could disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and require us to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of our customers.\nAlso, because our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption or black-out caused by an event such as a severe storm, generator or transmission facility outage on a neighboring system or the actions of a neighboring utility. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOG&E's electric generation, transmission and distribution assets are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchased power costs, accidents and third-party liability.\nOG&E owns and operates coal-fired, natural gas-fired, wind-powered and solar-powered generating assets. Operation of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or that could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of OG&E's operations. Included among these risks are:\n\u2022increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire;\n\u2022facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply;\n\u2022operator error or safety related stoppages;\n\u2022disruptions in the delivery of electricity; and\n\u2022catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes or other similar occurrences.\nThe occurrence of any of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, when unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, OG&E will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that could exceed OG&E's costs of generation or be forced to retire a generation unit if the cost or\ntiming of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. If OG&E is unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nChanges in technology, regulatory policies and customer electricity consumption may cause our assets to be less competitive and impact our results of operations.\nOG&E primarily generates electricity at large central facilities. This method typically results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells. It is possible that advances in technologies or changes in regulatory policies will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. OG&E's widespread use of Smart Grid technology allowing for two-way communications between the utility and its customers could enable the entry of technology companies into the interface between OG&E and its customers, resulting in unpredictable effects on our current business.\nReductions in customer electricity consumption, thereby reducing utility electric sales, could result from increased deployment of renewable energy technologies as well as increased efficiency of household appliances, among other general efficiency gains in technology. However, this potential reduction in load would not reduce our need for ongoing investments in our infrastructure to reliably serve our customers. Continued utility infrastructure investment without increased electricity sales could cause increased rates for customers, potentially resulting in further reductions in electricity sales and reduced profitability.\nWeather conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, flooding, earthquakes, prolonged droughts and the occurrence of wildfires, as well as seasonal temperature variations may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electric power. In OG&E's service area, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce our revenues, net income, available cash and borrowing ability. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, flooding, earthquakes, prolonged droughts and the occurrence of wildfires, may cause outages and property damage which may require us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned, as described above, would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period. In addition, prolonged droughts could cause a lack of sufficient water for use in cooling during the electricity generating process.\nPhysical risks from climate can be considered in both acute (event-driven) and chronic (longer-term shifts in climate patterns) terms. The effects of climate change could exacerbate physical changes in weather and the extreme weather events discussed above, including prolonged droughts, rise in temperatures and more extreme weather events like wildfires and ice storms, among other weather impacts. We have observed some of these events in recent years, and the trend could continue. OG&E can incur significant restoration costs as a result of these weather events. If OG&E is unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nMarket performance, increased retirements, changes in retirement plan regulations and increasing costs associated with our Pension Plan, health care plans and other employee-related benefits may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of our employees hired before December 1, 2009. We also have defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of our employees hired prior to February 1, 2000. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions with respect to the defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans have a significant impact on our results of operations and funding requirements. We expect to make future contributions to maintain required funding levels as necessary. It has been our practice to also make voluntary contributions to maintain more prudent funding levels than minimally required. We may continue to make voluntary contributions in the future. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.\nIf the employees who participate in the Pension Plan retire when they become eligible for retirement over the next several years, or if our plan experiences adverse market returns on its investments, or if interest rates materially fall, our pension expense and contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. The timing and number of employees retiring and selecting the lump-sum payment option could result in pension settlement charges that could materially affect our results of operations if we are unable to recover these costs through our electric rates. In addition, assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. Those factors are outside of our control.\nIn addition to the costs of our Pension Plan, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements with our Pension Plan, health care plans and other employee benefits may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nFinally, OGE Energy provided retirement benefits and retiree health care benefits to 63 employees previously seconded to Enable. As a result of the merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, the seconding agreement was terminated, and those employees are no longer employed by OGE Energy. If lump sum payments were made to those employees previously seconded to Enable, OGE Energy would recognize a settlement or curtailment of the pension/retiree health care charges, which would increase expense at OGE Energy by $19.4 million. Settlement and curtailment charges associated with the employees previously seconded to Enable are not reimbursable to OGE Energy.\nOGE Energy is a holding company with its primary assets being investments in its subsidiary, OG&E, and in its ownership of a portion of the equity securities of Energy Transfer.\nOGE Energy is a holding company and thus its primary assets are its investments in its subsidiary, OG&E, and in the equity securities of Energy Transfer. Substantially all of OGE Energy's operations are conducted by its subsidiary and through its investment in Energy Transfer's equity securities. Consequently, OGE Energy's operating cash flow and its ability to pay dividends and service its indebtedness are dependent upon the operating cash flow of OG&E and Energy Transfer and the payment of funds by them to OGE Energy in the form of dividends or distributions. At December 31, 2021, OGE Energy and OG&E had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities of $8.6 billion. OG&E and Energy Transfer are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due on OGE Energy's indebtedness or to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or distributions. In addition, their ability to pay dividends or distributions to OGE Energy depends on any statutory and contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such entity, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and other assets. Claims of creditors, including general creditors, of OG&E and Energy Transfer on their respective assets will generally have priority over OGE Energy claims (except to the extent that OGE Energy may be a creditor and its claims are recognized) and claims by OGE Energy shareholders.\nIn addition, as discussed above, OG&E is regulated by state utility commissions in Oklahoma and Arkansas as well as a federal regulatory agency which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. To the extent that the state commissions or federal regulatory agency attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of OG&E to pay dividends to OGE Energy, it could adversely affect its ability to continue to pay dividends.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OGE ENERGY'S INVESTMENT IN ENERGY TRANSFER'S EQUITY SECURITIES\nOGE Energy does not control Energy Transfer and therefore is not able to cause or prevent actions by Energy Transfer.\nAs discussed in \"Item 1. Business,\" OGE Energy's investment in Energy Transfer is accounted for as an investment in equity securities, primarily based on OGE Energy's approximately three percent ownership in Energy Transfer. Further, OGE Energy does not have influence over Energy Transfer, as OGE Energy does not own general partner units or have board representation. Accordingly, OGE Energy is unable to cause or prevent actions by Energy Transfer. Further, OGE Energy cannot control the actions of the other investors. OGE Energy's interests may not align with those of Energy Transfer or other investors, and this lack of control could adversely impact OGE Energy's investment in Energy Transfer's equity securities.\nA portion of OGE Energy's earnings and operating cash flows are based on the performance of Energy Transfer. If any of the following risks were to occur, OGE Energy's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in Energy Transfer's fair value could adversely affect OGE Energy's net income.\nEnergy Transfer is a publicly traded company. OGE Energy accounts for its investment in Energy Transfer as an investment in equity securities and records the investment at fair value through net income each quarter. If Energy Transfer's unit price were to lose value, regardless of cause, OGE Energy's net income would be adversely impacted.\nOGE Energy's operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions it receives from Energy Transfer.\nOGE Energy's operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions it receives from Energy Transfer. The amount of cash Energy Transfer can distribute on its units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, Energy Transfer's earnings and the general health and stability of the natural gas midstream sector.\nEnergy Transfer's fair value and the amount of cash it has available for distribution can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nEnergy Transfer's fair value and the amount of cash it has available for distribution can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend upon, among other things:\n\u2022the amount of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products transported through Energy Transfer's pipelines;\n\u2022the level of throughput in its processing and treating operations;\n\u2022the fees charged and the margins realized by Energy Transfer for its services;\n\u2022the price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022the relationship between natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices;\n\u2022the weather in its operating areas;\n\u2022the level of competition from other midstream, transportation and storage and retail marketing companies and other energy providers;\n\u2022the level of its operating costs and maintenance and integrity capital expenditures;\n\u2022the tax treatment being dependent on Energy Transfer's continuing status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as Energy Transfer not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation;\n\u2022prevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022the level and results of its derivative activities;\n\u2022any product liability claims and litigation; and\n\u2022performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs that could result in significant costs and liabilities.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash that Energy Transfer will have available for distribution will also depend on other factors, such as:\n\u2022the level of capital expenditures it makes;\n\u2022the level of costs related to litigation and regulatory compliance matters;\n\u2022the cost of acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022the levels of any margin calls that result from changes in commodity prices;\n\u2022debt service requirements;\n\u2022fluctuations in working capital needs;\n\u2022its ability to borrow under its revolving credit facilities;\n\u2022its ability to access capital markets;\n\u2022restrictions on distributions contained in its debt agreements; and\n\u2022the amount, if any, of cash reserves established by its board of directors and its general partners in their discretion for the proper conduct of its businesses.\nIncome from Energy Transfer's midstream, transportation, terminalling and storage operations is exposed to risks due to fluctuations in the demand for and price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products that are beyond Energy Transfer's control.\nThe prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products reflect market demand that fluctuates with changes in global and U.S. economic conditions and other factors, including:\n\u2022the level of domestic natural gas, NGL, refined products and oil production;\n\u2022the level of natural gas, NGL, refined products and oil imports and exports, including liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022actions taken by natural gas and oil producing nations;\n\u2022instability or other events affecting natural gas and oil producing nations;\n\u2022the impact of weather, public health crises such as pandemics (including COVID-19), and other events of nature on the demand for natural gas, NGLs, refined products and oil;\n\u2022the availability of storage, terminal and transportation systems, and refining, processing and treating facilities;\n\u2022the price, availability and marketing of competitive fuels;\n\u2022the demand for electricity;\n\u2022activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas and related products;\n\u2022the cost of capital needed to maintain or increase production levels and to construct and expand facilities;\n\u2022the impact of energy conservation and fuel efficiency efforts; and\n\u2022the extent of governmental regulations, taxation, fees and duties.\nIn the past, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, refined products and oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue.\nAny loss of business from Energy Transfer's existing customers or inability to attract new customers due to a decline in demand for natural gas, NGLs, refined products or oil could have a material adverse effect on its revenues and results of operations. In addition, significant price fluctuations for natural gas, NGL, refined products and oil commodities could materially affect Energy Transfer's profitability.\nGENERAL RISKS\nGovernmental and market reactions to events involving other public companies or other energy companies that are beyond our control may have negative impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital.\nAccounting irregularities at public companies in general, and energy companies in particular, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities and political contributions, could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny and suspicion for public companies, including those in the regulated and unregulated utility business. Accounting irregularities could cause regulators and legislators to review current accounting practices, financial disclosures and relationships between companies and their independent auditors. The capital markets and rating agencies also could increase their level of scrutiny. We believe that we are complying with all applicable laws and accounting standards, but it is difficult or impossible to predict or control what effect any of these types of events may have on our business, financial position, cash flows or access to the capital markets. It is unclear what additional laws or regulations may develop, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies, the energy industry or our operations specifically. Any new accounting standards could affect the way we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. These changes in accounting standards could lead to negative impacts on reported earnings or decreases in assets or increases in liabilities that could, in turn, affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our business and our results of operations.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of a recession could include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also could affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital. Economic conditions may also impact the valuation of certain long-lived assets that are subject to impairment testing, potentially resulting in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nEconomic conditions may be impacted by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which could impact the ability of our customers to pay timely, increase customer bankruptcies, and could lead to increased bad debt. If such circumstances occur, we expect that commercial and industrial customers would be impacted first, with residential customers following.\nIn addition, economic conditions, particularly budget shortfalls, could increase the pressure on federal, state and local governments to raise additional funds by increasing corporate tax rates and/or delaying, reducing or eliminating tax credits, grants or other incentives that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and increased reliance on processes dependent on technology.\nIn the regular course of our business, we handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. We are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of our information systems due to theft, ransomware, viruses, denial of service, hacking, acts of war or terrorism or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer information or system operating information, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOG&E operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. Such failures or breaches of the systems could impact the reliability of OG&E's generation, transmission and distribution systems which may result in a loss of service to customers and also subject OG&E to financial harm due to the significant expense to respond to security breaches or repair system damage. Our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cybersecurity incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third-party service providers' operations could also negatively impact our business. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and not recovered in a timely manner, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity threats continue to evolve and adapt. We and our third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt operations. None of these attempts has individually or in aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized access of our systems and data, or the disruption of our operations, either of which could have a material impact. Our security procedures, which include among others, virus protection software, cybersecurity controls and monitoring and our business continuity planning, including disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of cybersecurity attacks on our systems, which could adversely impact our operations.\nWe maintain property, casualty and cybersecurity insurance that may cover certain resultant cyber and physical damage or third-party injuries caused by potential cyber events. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may exceed the amount of any insurance available and other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered at all. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nThe failure of our technology infrastructure, or the failure to enhance existing technology infrastructure and implement new technology, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems, including the technology and network infrastructure that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such technology infrastructure may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on technology infrastructure, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data. Our technology infrastructure is dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers' systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical attack and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn addition to maintaining our current technology infrastructure, we believe the digital transformation of our business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Our technology infrastructure is critical to cost-effective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions, and we must enhance or replace our technology infrastructure in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology infrastructure, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, have resulted in increased costs to our business and could impact our ability to operate critical infrastructure. Continued hostilities or sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe long-term impact of terrorist attacks and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the electric utility and natural gas midstream industry in general, and on us in particular, cannot be known. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities or sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of supplies and markets for our products, and the possibility that our infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than existing insurance coverage.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 continues to be a developing situation around the globe that has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. In particular, efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have led to shutdowns of various facilities as well as disrupted supply chains around the world. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have also resulted in remote work arrangements, increased unemployment, customer slow payment or non-payment and decreased commercial and industrial load in the U.S. generally and in our service territory to a lesser extent. We expect these particular COVID-19 impacts will likely continue in the near future. We are continuing to monitor developments involving our workforce, customers and supply chains and cannot predict whether COVID-19 will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. However, an extended slowdown of the United States' economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in governmental policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets as well as the ability of various customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, we could experience employee engagement and/or turnover issues if federal or state authorities impose COVID-19-related vaccine or testing mandates. We could also face operational challenges if the pandemic worsens and large percentages of key personnel groups become sick and are unable to work for an extended period of time. Further, the negative impacts on the economy could also adversely impact the market value of the assets that fund our pension plans, which could necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements.\nIn addition, we have experienced and expect to experience raw material inflation, logistical challenges and certain component shortages. We cannot predict the ongoing impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The continued progression of, and global response to, the COVID-19 outbreak has increased and may continue to increase the risk of delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital investment plan, potentially resulting in an inability to deliver service in accordance with our plans and limiting the growth of the company. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate the other risks discussed within this Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. As this situation continues and can change rapidly, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nWe face certain human resource risks associated with the availability of trained and qualified labor to meet our future staffing requirements.\nWorkforce demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is higher than the national average. Over the next three years, 19 percent of our current employees will meet the eligibility requirements to retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents have anti-takeover effects.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Oklahoma corporation statute, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of OGE Energy. Such provisions, including those regulating the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders' meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, together with the possible issuance of preferred stock of OGE Energy without stockholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our Board of Directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise\nacquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder's best interest.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our debt securities do not fully prohibit OGE Energy or OG&E from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our revolving credit agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we now face may intensify.\nAny reductions in our credit ratings or changes in benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships or limit our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nWe cannot assure you that any of the current credit ratings of the Registrants will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Our ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a credit ratings downgrade or major market disruptions. Pricing grids associated with our credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of our short-term borrowings, but a reduction in our credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require us to post collateral or letters of credit.\nLoans to the Registrants under their credit facilities may be eurodollar loans or alternate base rate loans. LIBOR is the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. For example, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes a SOFR, which the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended as an alternative reference rate to U.S. Dollar LIBOR. It is not possible to predict what effect the phase out of LIBOR, or a change to SOFR or other alternative rates, may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nThe Registrants' current credit facilities provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events related to the phase out of LIBOR. The phase out of LIBOR, or a change to SOFR or other alternative rates, whether in connection with borrowings under the current credit facilities, or borrowings under replacement facilities or lines of credit, could expose the Registrants' future borrowings to less favorable rates. If the phase out of LIBOR, or a change to SOFR or other alternative rates, results in increased alternative interest rates or if the Registrants' lenders have increased costs due to such phase out or changes, then the Registrants' debt that uses benchmark rates could be affected and, in turn, the Registrants' cash flows and interest expense could be adversely impacted.\nOur debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nWe have revolving credit agreements for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Our credit facilities each have a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of 65 percent. The levels of our debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022our debt levels may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our key customers and counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers and counterparties could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to credit risks in our generation and retail distribution operations. Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties who owe us money or energy will breach their obligations. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected, and we could incur losses.", "PERMNO": 24440, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "OGE"}
