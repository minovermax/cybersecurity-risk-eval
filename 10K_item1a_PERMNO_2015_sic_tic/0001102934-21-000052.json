RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS\nOUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ONGOING CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC AND RELATED ADVERSE IMPACT TO WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS\nThe global impact of the Pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption across the world and in the countries and locations in which we and our customers and suppliers operate, which continues in varying degrees and locations, especially in places experiencing low vaccination rates and/or the spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus. Overall, our Electronic Materials segment has remained generally stable throughout the Pandemic, and has showed strengthening through fiscal year 2020 and 2021, with increased demand conditions in fiscal 2021 from the prior year in each of our Electronic Materials businesses, despite the ongoing nature of the Pandemic. With respect to our Performance Materials segment, the Pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our Performance Materials\u2019 PIM business, which first appeared during the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and has continued through fiscal year 2021, as the demand for drag reducing agents (\u201cDRAs\u201d) declined significantly due to the ongoing dislocation in the energy sector caused by the Pandemic. Although this business showed some improvement in demand conditions at different times during fiscal 2021, recovery has been lower than anticipated, and as described in Note 9 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain factors related to it continue to adversely affect the PIM reporting unit. The extent to which the ongoing Pandemic may further impact our business, operations, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and difficult to estimate, and depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, which may include: An additional decrease in short-term and long-term demand and pricing for our products and services, and an ongoing adverse global economic environment with respect to inflationary pressures and supply chain dislocations that could further reduce demand and/or pricing for our products and services; Disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing of or pricing for materials, equipment and logistics or other services and support necessary to our business as a longer term result of the Pandemic and efforts to contain the spread of the Pandemic; Adverse impacts on our business and those of our customers resulting from renewed actions taken by governments, businesses, or the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spread of such infectious diseases, such as renewed travel restrictions, quarantines, and business shutdowns or slowdowns; Negative impacts to our operations, including reductions in production levels, research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) activities, and qualification activities with our customers, and increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of the Pandemic through additional or continued social-distancing measures we have enacted at our locations around the world in an effort to protect our employees\u2019 health and well-being (including working from home, reducing the number of employees or others in our sites at any one time and how such individuals perform work while at our sites, redesigning or adjusting our manufacturing, R&D and office facilities, and suspending or limiting employee travel); and, deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures, result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties, and result in losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults or our customers\u2019 inability to pay. Although the rollout of vaccination programs in the U.S., Europe, parts of Asia and other places in which we operate is encouraging with respect to the containment and abatement of the Pandemic, limited availability of vaccines in certain places and/or low vaccination rates, contributes to ongoing uncertainty with respect to the Pandemic\u2019s impact on our business and operations, and the resumption of what was previously considered normal business operations after such interruption also remains uncertain, and may be further delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the Pandemic on our Company and our customers, suppliers, and third-party service providers. These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, legal exposure, or financial condition; an example of such effect is the impairment charge related to our PIM business described in Note 9 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A further sustained or prolonged outbreak or return of the Pandemic in the places in which we do business, such as that seen in the spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus through our fiscal 2021, could exacerbate the adverse impact of such measures on our Company.\nINDEX\nDEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND OTHER CONDITIONS\nOur business is affected by economic and industry conditions, such as those still being adversely affected by the Pandemic, and the majority of our revenue derives from our Electronic Materials segment, which is primarily dependent upon semiconductor industry demand. With respect to our Electronic Materials segment, historically, semiconductor industry demand has fluctuated due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can affect our business, causing demand for our electronic materials products to fluctuate. For example, prior to the Pandemic, the relatively soft demand conditions in the semiconductor industry that had commenced in our second fiscal quarter of 2019 and continued into our first fiscal quarter of 2020 had begun to ameliorate in the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of 2020. While our Electronic Materials segment experienced relatively stable conditions during the second half of fiscal 2020 and showed strengthening through fiscal 2021, uncertainty remains as to our fiscal 2022 demand conditions for the semiconductor industry given the ongoing nature of the Pandemic and related macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressures, supply chain and logistics challenges, as well as related including supply constraints at our customers serving certain areas, such as the automotive and industrial sectors. Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business. Our limited visibility to future customer orders makes it difficult for us to predict industry trends, especially during unusual adverse circumstances, such as the Pandemic and related macroeconomic factors. If the global economy or the semiconductor industry does not continue to improve or weakens again, whether in general or as a result of the Pandemic or other specific factors, such as macroeconomic factors, or unpredictable events such as natural disasters, geopolitical conditions and international trade tensions, civil unrest, geopolitical factors, or additional global health crises, we could experience material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. Some additional factors that may affect demand for our electronic materials products include: demand trends for different types of electronic devices such as logic versus memory integrated circuit (\u201cIC\u201d) devices, or digital versus analog IC devices; the various technology nodes at which those products are manufactured; customers' efficiencies in the use of CMP consumables and/or high-purity process chemicals (\u201celectronic chemicals\u201d); customers\u2019 device architectures and specific manufacturing processes; the short order to delivery time for our products; quarter-to-quarter changes in customer order patterns; market share and competitive gains and losses; and pricing changes by us and our competitors.\nAs to our Performance Materials segment our PIM business may continue to be impacted by changes in the oil and gas industries, such as we have seen since the second half of our fiscal 2020 and through our fiscal 2021 resulting from ongoing significant dislocation in these industries caused by the Pandemic and supply chain related challenges. Expectations about future prices and price volatility in the sector, which affect our customers\u2019 activity levels, are important in determining future spending levels for customers of our PIM products and services. The ongoing volatility in worldwide oil and natural gas prices and markets are an example of historical volatility in this sector, and such volatility is likely to continue in the future. As is currently the case, prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor or major changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, decreases or increases in supplies from U.S. shale production or other oil production, geopolitical conditions, including civil unrest and international trade tensions, sovereign debt crises, the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer demand due to economic growth or contraction such as seen related to the Pandemic, and related factors in countries such as China, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the health of international economic and credit markets, the ability of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain oil price and production controls, and general economic conditions, such as those currently seen arising from the Pandemic.\nFurther, adverse global economic, industry and other conditions such as those arising from the Pandemic could have other negative effects on our Company. For instance, we could experience negative impacts on cash flows due to the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us, or our production processes could be harmed if our suppliers significantly raise their prices, or cannot fulfill their obligations, to us. As a result of these or other conditions, and as experienced in our second fiscal quarter with the impairment charge we took in our PIM business unit, further described in Note 9 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we also might have to further reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could harm our financial position and results of operations.\nINDEX\nWE MAY PURSUE ACQUISITIONS OF, INVESTMENTS IN, AND MERGERS OR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OTHER ENTITIES, WHICH COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS IF THEY ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, OR WE MAY ENCOUNTER UNANTICIPATED ISSUES IN IMPLEMENTING THEM\nWe expect to continue to make investments in technologies, assets and companies, either through acquisitions, mergers, investments or alliances, in order to supplement our organic growth and development efforts. Acquisitions, mergers, and investments, including the acquisition of KMG, which we completed in November 2018, and the ITS Acquisition, which we completed in April 2021, involve numerous risks, including the following: difficulties and risks in integrating the operations, technologies, digital and physical security, compliance programs, products and personnel of acquired companies; difficulties and risks from unanticipated issues arising subsequent to a transaction related to the other entity; potential disruption of relationships with third parties such as customers or suppliers; diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business; increased risk associated with foreign operations including exposure to new rules, regulations, customs and workforce expectations; potential difficulties and risks in entering markets or industries in which we have limited or no direct prior experience and/or where competitors have stronger positions; potential difficulties and unexpected situations arising in operating new businesses with different business models, facilities and operations; potential difficulties with regulatory or contract compliance in areas in which we have limited or no experience; initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; or inability to effectively cooperate and collaborate with our alliance partners.\nFurther, we may never realize the perceived or anticipated benefits of a business combination or merger with, or asset or other acquisition of, or investments in, other entities. Transactions such as the acquisitions of KMG and ITS could and in some cases have had negative effects on our results of operations, in areas such as contingent liabilities, gross margins, amortization charges related to intangible assets and other effects of accounting for the purchases of other business entities. Investments in and acquisitions of technology-related or early-stage companies or assets are inherently risky because these businesses or assets may never develop, and we may incur losses related to these investments.\nIn addition, we may be required to impair the carrying value of these acquisitions or investments to reflect other than temporary declines in their value. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangible assets represents the fair value of customer relationships, trade names and other acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated for impairment by management at least annually. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets is impaired, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Examples of asset impairment charges we recently incurred include the charge we took in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 related to the PIM business unit and the charge we took in each the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the each of our four quarters of fiscal 2021 related to the KMG wood treatment business due to our decision in fiscal 2019 to exit this business. We expect that the carrying value of the wood treatment reporting unit will not be recoverable, resulting in future impairments of goodwill. The amount of such impairments could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Notes 9 and 10 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nFurthermore, the integration of the acquired businesses into our operations is a complex and time-consuming process that may not be successful. Our Company has a limited history of integrating significant acquisitions, and the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. As demonstrated in the acquisitions of KMG and ITS, the primary areas of focus for successfully combining those businesses with our operations may include and have included, among others: retaining and integrating key employees; realizing synergies; aligning customer and supplier interfaces, and operations across the combined business; integrating enterprise resource planning and other information technology systems; and, managing the growth of the combined company. Even if we successfully integrate an acquired business into our operations, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition.\nINDEX\nWE HAVE A CONCENTRATED PRODUCT RANGE WITHIN EACH OF OUR SEGMENTS AND OUR PRODUCTS MAY BECOME OBSOLETE, OR TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY REDUCE OR LIMIT INCREASES IN THE CONSUMPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS\nAlthough our product offerings have expanded over the past several years, including as a result of the acquisitions of KMG and ITS, our business remains substantially dependent on products in our Electronic Materials segment, such as CMP slurries, pads and electronic chemicals, and materials technologies, which account for the majority of our revenue. The product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated. As such, our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased. Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the industries in which we operate, particularly the semiconductor industry, to adapt, improve and customize our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends, and to differentiate our products from those of our competitors. Since its inception, the semiconductor industry, which is the largest industry in which we operate, has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices. Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including products in our Electronic Materials business segment, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce. We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future. Potential technology developments in the semiconductor industry, as well as our customers' efforts to reduce consumption of CMP consumables, including through use of smaller quantities, could render our products less important to the IC device manufacturing process.\nA SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR BUSINESS COMES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF LARGE CUSTOMERS AND OUR REVENUE AND PROFITS COULD DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IF WE LOST ONE OR MORE OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR BUSINESS FROM THEM\nOur customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers in each of our segments. Currently, our principal business supplies electronic materials primarily to the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has been consolidating as the larger semiconductor manufacturers have generally grown faster than the smaller ones, through business gains, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic alliances. Industry analysts predict that this trend will continue, which means the semiconductor industry will continue to be comprised of fewer and larger participants in the future if their prediction is correct. In addition, our customer base in our PIM business is also somewhat concentrated, with large entities predominant, and outside of the U.S., these entities frequently are state-owned or sponsored, and limited in number per country. One or more of these principal customers could stop buying products from us or could substantially reduce the quantity of products purchased from us. Our principal customers in both our segments also hold considerable purchasing power, which can impact the pricing and terms of sale of our products. Any deferral or significant reduction in the quantity or price of products sold to these principal customers, an inability to raise prices to address cost pressures or otherwise, or a weakening of the financial condition of or failure to perform contractual obligations by one of these principal customers, could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nANY PROBLEM OR DISRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING SUPPLY OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS, OR IN OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe depend on our supply chain to enable us to meet the demands of our customers. Our supply chain includes the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, our production operations and the means by which we deliver our products to our customers. Our business could be adversely affected by any problem or interruption in the supply of the key raw materials we use in our products, including raw materials that do not meet the stringent quality and consistency requirements of our customers, any problem or interruption that may occur during production or delivery of our products, such as weather-related problems, natural disasters, logistics challenges, global public health crises such as the ongoing Pandemic, geopolitical, trade or labor-related issues, civil unrest, or any difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of our products to meet growing demand from our customers. In particular, natural disasters and severe weather conditions have the potential to adversely affect our operations, damage facilities and increase our costs, and those conditions may also have an indirect effect on our operations by disrupting services provided by service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. Additionally, some of our full-time employees are represented by labor unions, works councils or comparable organizations, particularly in Mexico and Europe. An extended work stoppage, slowdown or other action by our employees could significantly disrupt our business. As our current agreements with labor unions and works councils expire, we cannot provide assurance that new agreements will be reached at the end of each period without union action, or that a new agreement will be reached on terms satisfactory to us. Future labor contracts may be on terms that result in higher labor costs to us, which also could adversely affect our results of operations. As experienced in the second half of our fiscal 2021 and ongoing, our supply chain may also be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation or to supply restrictions beyond the control of our Company or our raw materials suppliers, such as those related to or arising from the Pandemic.\nINDEX\nWe believe it would be difficult to promptly secure alternative sources of key raw materials in the event one of our suppliers becomes unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials that meet the quality and technical specifications required by us and our customers, or the costs of such raw materials increase in an untenable manner. Requalifying and/or transferring our sourcing to a new supplier would likely result in manufacturing delays and additional costs. In addition, new contract terms, forced production or manufacturing changes, contractual amendments to existing agreements with, or non-performance by, our suppliers, including any significant financial distress our suppliers may suffer, could adversely affect us. Also, if we change the supplier or type of key raw materials we use to make our products, in particular our electronic materials products, or are required to purchase them from a different manufacturer or manufacturing facility or otherwise modify our products, in certain circumstances our customers might have to requalify our products for their manufacturing processes and products. The requalification process could take a significant amount of time and expense to complete and could occupy technical resources of our customers that might otherwise be used to evaluate our new products, thus delaying potential revenue growth, or motivate our customers to consider purchasing products from our competitors, possibly interrupting or reducing our sales of products to these customers, especially sales of our electronic materials products to our semiconductor industry customers, but also with respect to our PIM products to our pipeline and adjacent industry customers. In addition, government authorities in the foreign countries in which we operate may require or incentivize the use of local suppliers that are our competitors, which could adversely impact our business, including our results of operations.\nOUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING TARGETED SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES FROM COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES\nTo mitigate cost challenges and improve our business and financial performance, we have initiated an enterprise-wide cost optimization program designed to reduce expenses and enhance operational efficiencies. These actions may include position eliminations, location rationalization, and reductions in outside services and discretionary spending, as well as other actions to reduce costs. We may not realize anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives, whether at all or according to timetables we have established. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected, and failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business.\nOUR BUSINESS COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED IF OUR COMPETITORS DEVELOP COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, OFFER BETTER PRICING, SERVICE OR OTHER TERMS, OR OBTAIN OR ASSERT CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\nCompetition from other electronic materials or performance materials providers or any new entrants could seriously harm our business and results of operations, and this competition could continue to increase. Competition has and will likely continue to impact the prices we are able to charge for our products, as well as our overall business. In addition, our competitors could have, obtain or assert intellectual property rights that could affect or restrict our ability to market our existing products and/or to innovate and develop new products, thus increasing our costs of doing business, could attempt to introduce products similar to ours following the expiration of our patents, or could attempt to introduce products that do not fall within the scope of our intellectual property rights.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nWe currently have operations and a large customer base outside the U.S. Approximately 68% of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside the U.S. for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. We may encounter risks in doing business in certain countries other than the U.S., including, but not limited to, adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both in foreign locations and in the U.S. with respect to non-U.S. operations of U.S. businesses like ours, geopolitical and/or trade tensions, global health crises such as the ongoing Pandemic, civil unrest, fluctuation in exchange rates, changes in international trade requirements and sanctions and/or tariffs that affect our business and that of our customers and suppliers, compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and related audits and investigations, as well as difficulty in enforcing business and customer contracts and agreements, including protection of intellectual property rights. We also may encounter risks that we may not be able to repatriate additional earnings from our operations outside the U.S., derive anticipated tax benefits of these operations or recover the investments made in them, whether due to regulatory or policy changes in the U.S. or in the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business, or other factors.\nINDEX\nIn particular, China continues to be an important market for the semiconductor industry, and an area of continued potential growth for us. As business between China and the rest of the world has continued to grow, there is risk that geopolitical, political, diplomatic and national security factors, changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, the imposition of trade restrictions, tariffs and taxes, and global public health crises such as the Pandemic could adversely affect business for companies like ours. This is due in significant part to the complex relationships among China, the U.S., and other countries, especially those in the Asia Pacific region, such as Taiwan, which also is important to our company with respect ot our customers as well as our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business, or, provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers rather than companies like ours, all of which could adversely impact our business, including our results of operations. Also, as seen in fiscal year 2020 and fiscal 2021, there are risks that the U.S. government may impose additional export restrictions on technology and products that companies that operate in the semiconductor industry supply to or use in China, which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.\nIn addition, we have operations and customers located in the United Kingdom, which exited the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). As the transitional provisions under which the United Kingdom and the EU had agreed to operate expired at the end of December 2020, and the parties are still in the process of implementing new trade agreements, the related impacts on our business remain unclear.\nLEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY RISKS\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND MAY INCUR COSTS THAT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AS A RESULT OF VIOLATIONS OF OR LIABILITIES UNDER THEM\nLike other companies involved in environmentally sensitive businesses, our operations and properties are subject to extensive and stringent federal, state, local and foreign Environmental, Health and Safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) laws and regulations, including those concerning, among other things:\n\u2022the marketing, sale, use and registration of our chemical products, such as penta, which is part of the wood treatment business in our Performance Materials segment;\n\u2022the treatment, storage and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022the investigation and remediation of contaminated media including but not limited to soil and groundwater;\n\u2022the discharge of effluents into waterways;\n\u2022the emission of substances into the air; and\n\u2022other matters relating to environmental protection and various health and safety matters.\nThe United States EPA and other federal and state agencies in the U.S., as well as comparable agencies in other countries where we have facilities or sell our products, such as Canada or Mexico, have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have a material adverse impact on our operations. These EHS laws and regulations may require permits for certain types of operations, require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment, place restrictions upon operations or impose substantial liability for pollution and other EHS concerns resulting from our operations. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations has resulted in ongoing costs for us and could restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities, continue production, require us to install costly emission control equipment, or incur significant other expenses, including environmental compliance costs. We continue to manage environmental compliance activities at certain sites, such as at KMG-Bernuth\u2019s Tuscaloosa, Alabama facility as described in Note 19 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to comply with EHS laws or to address liabilities for contamination resulting from past or present operations. Federal, state and foreign governmental authorities may seek fines and penalties, as well as injunctive relief, for violation of EHS laws and regulations, and could, among other things, impose liability on us to cleanup or to respond to potential damages to the environment or natural resources resulting from a release of pesticides, hazardous materials or other chemicals into the environment. We maintain insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental pollution or damages. We do not believe that insurance coverage for environmental pollution or damage that occurs over time is available at a reasonable cost. Also, we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental pollution incidents is available at a reasonable cost. Accordingly, we may be subject to an uninsured or under-insured loss in such cases; the KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire, as described in Note 19 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be such an instance.\nINDEX\nThe distribution, sale and use of our products is subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation: Our products are subject to laws administered by federal, state and foreign governments, including regulations requiring registration, approval and labeling. The labeling requirements restrict the use and type of application for our products. More stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. All venues where our penta products are used also require registration prior to marketing or use.\nGovernmental regulatory authorities have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific testing and data production be provided on our products. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d), the EPA requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support U.S. registrations. This requirement significantly increases our Operating expenses, and we expect those expenses will continue in the future while we operate the wood treatment business. Because scientific analyses are constantly improving, we cannot determine with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by regulatory authorities. While good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum protocols and procedures that must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the EPA, there can be no assurance that the EPA will not request certain tests or studies be repeated. In addition, more stringent legislation or requirements may be imposed in the future and proposed amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act could result in increased regulatory controls , additional testing of chemicals we manufacture and could increase the costs of compliance for our operations. We can provide no assurance that the cost of such compliance will not adversely affect our profitability. Our products could also be subject to other future regulatory action that may result in restricting or completely banning their use which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nINDEX\n1. The Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) legislation may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products in the EU: REACH requires chemical manufacturers and importers in the EU to prove the safety of their products. We were required to pre-register certain products and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern are subject to an authorization process. Authorization may result in restrictions on certain uses of products or even prohibitions on the manufacture or importation of products. The full registration requirements of REACH have been phased in over several years, and we have incurred additional expense to cause the registration of our products under these regulations. REACH may also affect our ability to import, manufacture and sell certain products in the EU. In addition, other countries and regions of the world already have or may adopt legislation similar to REACH that affect our business, affect our ability to import, manufacture or sell certain products in these jurisdictions, and have required or will require us to incur increased costs.\n2. The classification of penta as a Persistent Organic Pollutant (\u201cPOP\u201d) under the Stockholm Convention adversely affected our ability to manufacture or sell our penta products: The Conference of the Parties (\u201cCOP\u201d) accepted the recommendation of the United Nations Persistent Organic Pollutant Review Committee that the use of penta should be banned except that its use for the treatment of utility poles and crossarms could continue for an extended period of five to ten years. KMG-Bernuth supplies penta to industrial customers who use it primarily to treat utility poles and crossarms. The U.S. is not bound by the determination of the COP because it did not ratify the Stockholm Convention treaty. Canada and Mexico are governed by the treaty. KMG-Bernuth\u2019s sole penta manufacturing facility is located in Matamoros, Mexico, and its processing facility is located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. As a result of the classification of penta as a POP, the Mexican government requires KMG-Bernuth to cease producing penta in Mexico by the end of calendar year 2021. In July 2020, the Canadian government released a proposed order that sales and use of penta in Canada be ceased, but such proposed order is subject to a comment period and is not final, and no timing for any such order, if implemented, has been proposed. In March 2021, the EPA issued a preliminary interim registration review decision (\u201cPID\u201d) proposing the cancellation of penta registration and implementation of a five-year phase-out period for production and sell-through of penta stocks. We do not believe the PID or the Canadian government proposed order have a significant adverse effect on our business because in July 2019, KMG-Bernuth had communicated that we did not intend to continue the wood treatment business past approximately the end of calendar year 2021. We took a restructuring charge in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, and asset impairment charges in each of our fourth fiscal quarters of 2020 and 2019, as well as in each of our fiscal quarters of fiscal 2021, related to the decisions to close the Matamoros and Tuscaloosa facilities and to exit the wood treatment business, as described further in Note 19 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to take additional impairment charges related to the wood treatment business as we approach the closure dates of the facilities. No assurance can be given that we will not incur significant expenditures in connection with closing the facilities, or that the ultimate action of the COP and our related decisions will not adversely impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\n3. Our use of hazardous materials exposes us to potential liabilities: Our manufacturing and distribution of chemical products, such as our electronic chemicals, involves the controlled use of hazardous materials. Our operations, therefore, are subject to various associated risks, including chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, fires, mechanical failure, storage facility leaks and similar events. Our suppliers are subject to similar risks that may adversely impact the availability of raw materials. While we adapt our manufacturing and distribution processes to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials, including injury of our employees, individuals who handle our products or goods treated with our products, or others who claim to have been exposed to our products, nor can we completely eliminate the unanticipated interruption or suspension of operations at our facilities due to such events. We may be held liable for significant damages or fines in the event of contamination or injury, and such assessed damages or fines could have an adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nCURRENT OR FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS\nThe U.S. has recently rejoined the Paris Climate Accord but to date, has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Clean Air Act has been interpreted to regulate greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions and the EPA is using its existing regulatory authority to develop regulations requiring reduction in GHG emissions from various categories of sources, such as when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislation program addressing GHGs, a number of U.S. federal laws related to GHG emissions have been considered by the U.S. Congress from time to time and various state, local and regional regulations and initiatives have been enacted or are being considered related to GHGs.\nINDEX\nMember States of the EU each have an overall cap on emissions, which are approved by the European Commission, and implement the EU Emissions Trading Directive as a commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. GHG emissions are regulated by Member States through the EU Emission Trading System and the EU Effort Sharing Decision/Regulation depending upon the industry sector. Organizations apply to the Member State for an allowance of GHG emissions. These allowances are tradable so as to enable companies that manage to reduce their GHG emissions to sell their excess allowances to companies that are not reaching their emissions objectives. Failure to purchase sufficient allowances will require the purchase of allowances at a current market price.\nAny laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could cause an increase to our raw material costs, require us to incur increased operating costs, and have an adverse effect on demand for our products and our financial performance and results for our business.\nIn addition to GHG and climate change regulatory developments and legislation, we are continuing to evaluate and assess the potential impact on our business of the ongoing transition worldwide to a low carbon, resilient economy as well as physical effects resulting from climate change.\nOUR PRODUCTS MAY BE RENDERED OBSOLETE OR LESS ATTRACTIVE BY CHANGES IN INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS OR BY SUPPLY-CHAIN DRIVEN PRESSURES TO SHIFT TO ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVES\nChanges in regulatory, legislative and industry requirements, or changes driven by supply-chain pressures, may shift current customers away from products using penta, products containing hazardous materials, or certain of our other products and toward alternative products that are believed to have fewer environmental effects. The EPA, foreign and state regulators, local governments, private environmental advocacy organizations, investors and investor advisory firms, and a number of large industrial companies have proposed or adopted policies designed to decrease the use of a variety of chemicals, including penta and others included in certain of our products, such as those containing hazardous materials, or to counteract the growth of certain industries such as those in which customers served by our PIM products operate. Our ability to anticipate changes in regulatory, legislative, investor, and industry requirements, or changes driven by supply-chain pressures, may affect our ability to remain competitive. Further, we may not be able to comply with changed or new regulatory or industrial standards that may be necessary for us to remain competitive.\nWe cannot provide assurance that the EPA, foreign and state regulators or local governments will not restrict the uses of certain of our products, like penta, or ban the use of one or more of these products or the raw materials in them. Similarly, companies who use our products may voluntarily decide to reduce significantly or cease the use of our products. As a result, our products may become obsolete or less attractive to our customers.\nGENERAL COMMERCIAL, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nBECAUSE WE RELY ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY OBTAIN OR PROTECT IT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS\nProtection of intellectual property is particularly important in the semiconductor industry, which is the primary industry in which we participate, because we develop complex technical formulas and processes for products that are proprietary in nature and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. Our intellectual property is important to our success and ability to compete. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. In addition, we protect our product differentiation through various other means, such as proprietary supply arrangements for certain raw materials, and use of certain manufacturing technologies. Due to our international operations, we pursue protection in different jurisdictions, which may provide varying degrees of protection, and we cannot provide assurance that we can obtain adequate protection in each such jurisdiction. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason, including through the patent prosecution process or in the event of litigation related to such intellectual property, which we pursue when necessary to protect our rights against others who are found to be misusing our intellectual property, could seriously harm our business. In addition, certain types of intellectual property, such as patents, expire after a certain period of time, and products protected by our patents then lose such protection, so we refresh our intellectual property portfolio on an ongoing basis through continued innovation, and failure to do so could adversely affect our business. Also, the costs of obtaining or protecting our intellectual property could negatively affect our operating results.\nINDEX\nOUR INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO SUFFER\nWe utilize and rely upon a global workforce. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and customer support personnel, our business and our ability to maintain existing and obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. We compete worldwide with other participants in the industries in which we conduct business for qualified personnel, particularly those with significant experience in the semiconductor and pipeline industries. The loss of services of key employees, or our inability to obtain or maintain visas or other travel or residency documents on their behalf with respect to our business needs, could harm our business and results of operations.\nBECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN BUSINESS AREAS OUTSIDE OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS INTO OTHER PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL\nAn element of our strategy has been to leverage our customer relationships, technological expertise and other capabilities and competencies to expand our business. For example, we have made acquisitions to expand beyond CMP consumables into other electronic materials product areas, as well as into performance materials product areas in which we have limited experience. Expanding our business into new product areas could involve technologies, production processes and business models in which we have limited experience, and we may not be able to develop and produce products or provide services that satisfy customers' needs, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological or other developments. Or, we may decide that we no longer wish to pursue these new business initiatives. Also, our competitors may have or obtain intellectual property rights that could restrict our ability to market our existing products and/or to innovate and develop new products.\nCERTAIN CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS COULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CYBERSECURITY AND OTHER THREATS OR VULNERABILITIES\nWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include, but are not limited to, telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, production control systems, enterprise resource planning systems, network communications, and email. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, and Cloud providers. All these information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from various sources including, but not limited to, attacks, degradation, and failures resulting from potential sources, including viruses, malware, denial of service, ransomware, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage. Confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these information systems, or transmitted to or from Cloud storage, could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised, lost, and/or stolen. While we have implemented security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control, and emergency recovery processes to mitigate risks like these with respect to information systems that are under our control, they are not fail-safe and may be subject to breaches or failures. Further, we cannot assure that third parties upon whom we rely for various IT services will maintain sufficient vigilance and controls over their systems. Our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of personal or confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, including our results of operations, and our reputation, as well as our relationships with our employees or other individuals whose information may have been affected by such cybersecurity incidents.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Privacy security laws and regulations, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016, and similar laws in countries such as Korea and Taiwan, among others, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD PREVENT US FROM GROWING, AND OUR EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT COULD RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES\nIn the future we may be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Our credit agreement as amended (\u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d) contains financial and other covenants that may restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under it. Furthermore, additional equity financing may dilute the interests of our common stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could further restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives and could reduce our profitability. If we raise or borrow funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nINDEX\nTHE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND RAPIDLY\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of factors such as: economic, geopolitical, global public health (i.e., the Pandemic), political and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact participants in the semiconductor and related industries; and/or participants in oil and gas related industries; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts who follow our stock; earnings and other announcements, and changes in market evaluations, by securities analysts, investors, market participants or others, of or related to, us or participants in the semiconductor and related industries; changes in business, trade or regulatory conditions affecting us or participants in the semiconductor and related industries; announcements or implementation by us, our competitors, or our customers of technological innovations, new products or different business strategies; changes in our capital deployment strategy, issuances of shares of our capital stock or entering into a business combination or other strategic transaction; and trading volume of our common stock.\nANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS UNDER OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS MAY DISCOURAGE THIRD PARTIES FROM MAKING AN UNSOLICITED BID FOR OUR COMPANY\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and various provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult or expensive to effect a change in control of our Company. For instance, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three-year terms.\nWe have adopted change in control arrangements covering our executive officers and other key employees. These arrangements provide for a cash severance payment, continued medical benefits and other ancillary payments and benefits upon termination of service of a covered employee\u2019s employment following a change in control, which may make it more expensive to acquire our Company.", "PERMNO": 88152, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "CCMP"}
