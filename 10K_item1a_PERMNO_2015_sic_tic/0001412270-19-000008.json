RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not maintain our current rate of revenue growth.\nOur revenues have grown steadily, increasing to $192.3 million in fiscal year 2018 from $174.1 million in fiscal year 2017, representing an annual growth rate of 10%. Our continued revenue growth and the rate of our revenue growth depend largely on our ability to effectively and efficiently grow our membership, increase the number of families who pay for our products and services, increase the average revenue per paying families and lengthen the time period existing and new families continue to pay for our products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to expand our paying family base at historical rates, or at all. In addition, our revenue growth rate may decline if we are not able to increase the number of paying families while managing our acquisition costs within our targeted return on investment range or if we are unsuccessful in cross-selling new and existing products and services to our members, such as our consumer payments solutions, or in continuing to develop and innovate with new products, services and solutions that members consider valuable, such as our mobile solutions. Furthermore, our revenue growth rate may decline if we are unable to expand our Care@Work client basis.\nYou should not rely on our historical rate of revenue growth as an indication of our future performance. If our growth rates were to decline significantly or become negative, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect our revenue and operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results have historically fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future. Such fluctuations may be significant and unpredictable and may fail to match our projections or the expectations of securities analysts due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Any of these events could cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate.\nIn addition, we generally experience some seasonal fluctuations in our financial results due to heightened demand for caregivers from families at the beginning of the school year and at the beginning of the calendar year. Accordingly, purchases of subscriptions for our consumer matching solutions are generally higher in the first and third quarters than they are in the second and fourth quarters. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop, and the seasonality of consumer behavior that we have observed in the past may change.\nWe have based our current and projected future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are relatively fixed in the short term. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue, and even a small shortfall in revenue could disproportionately and adversely affect our financial results for a given quarter.\nIn addition to the other risk factors listed in this section, our operating results may be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain paying families;\n\u2022fluctuations in demand for our products and services;\n\u2022fluctuations in sales cycles for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition as a result of guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States;\n\u2022general economic conditions in our domestic and international markets and fluctuations in exchange rates;\n\u2022our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that are attractive to our members;\n\u2022\nthe mix of monthly memberships and annual memberships, as the amount of revenue recognized per month on an annual membership is less than a monthly membership;\n\u2022member acceptance of new product introductions;\n\u2022the timing and success of changes in our pricing strategies and our competitor\u2019s pricing strategies;\n\u2022our ability to sell our services to employers and care-related businesses;\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions of other businesses and our ability to successfully integrate, manage and grow those businesses;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with actual and threatened lawsuits and government investigations;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the dynamics of the markets in which we compete, including new entrants or substantial discounting of competitive products;\n\u2022\nany decision to increase or decrease operating expenses in response to changes in the marketplace or perceived marketplace opportunities;\n\u2022our ability to derive benefits from our investments in sales, marketing, engineering or other activities;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment for our products domestically and internationally;\n\u2022volatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock compensation expenses; and\n\u2022\nunpredictable fluctuations in our effective tax rate due to disqualifying dispositions of stock from our stock incentive plan, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.\nWe operate in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nThe market for accessing family care online is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, making it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our business and prospects may be significantly affected by the risks and difficulties we may encounter in this rapidly evolving market. These risks and difficulties include those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022attract and retain members and maintain an appropriate family to caregiver ratio of active members;\n\u2022encourage paying families to stay longer and return as paying families sooner after their paid membership lapses;\n\u2022\ncross-sell our products and services to our new and existing members;\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop and diversify our product offerings for members;\n\u2022\ninnovate more quickly than our competition to maintain and expand our position as a market lead;\n\u2022\nanticipate and react to changes in technology such as the shift from personal computers to mobile devices;\n\u2022sell our services to employers and care-related businesses;\n\u2022provide our members with superior user experiences;\n\u2022motivate members to contribute additional, timely and accurate content to our marketplace;\n\u2022anticipate and react to challenges from existing and new competitors;\n\u2022maintain the strength and increase awareness of our brand;\n\u2022integrate and grow the businesses we acquire as anticipated; and\n\u2022manage and grow our international operations in existing and new markets.\nFailure to adequately address these risks and difficulties could harm our business, impact our ability to maintain positive net income. In addition, if the demand for online care does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs of this demand, our business will be harmed.\nIf the revenue generated by paying families differs significantly from our expectations, or if our membership acquisition costs differ significantly from our expectations, we may not be able to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate profits from these investments.\nWe had $60.5 million in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year 2018 and $66.9 million in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year 2017. While we intend to further leverage unpaid marketing channels, we expect to continue to make significant investments to acquire additional members, including advertising through television, online, social media and other advertising campaigns. Our decisions regarding these investments are based on our anticipated marketing cost to acquire each additional paying family, the success of our unpaid marketing initiatives, and our analysis of the revenue we believe we can generate per paying family over the expected lifetime of such membership.\nIn addition, most of our paying families are currently enrolled in monthly memberships, and the average total paid membership length for our consumer matching solutions is approximately 11.3 months. As a result, to maintain our revenue we must continually replace paying families who allow their membership to lapse with new paying families either by converting existing non-paying families or by attracting new paying families to our service. Our anticipated member acquisition costs and our analysis of the revenue that we expect new paying families to generate over the life of the membership depends upon estimates and assumptions, regarding, among other things, paid membership lengths and renewal rates, conversion rates of existing families to paying families, future membership fees and our success in cross-selling existing and new products and services to members.\nIf our estimates and assumptions regarding either our costs to acquire paying families or the revenue we can generate from those memberships over their lifetime prove incorrect, we may be unable to recover our member acquisition costs and our net income may decrease. Similarly, if our member acquisition costs increase, or if the revenue we generate from new members decreases, the return on our investment in acquiring new members may be lower than we anticipate. If we cannot generate profits from this investment, we may need to alter our growth strategy, and our growth rate and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe continue to focus on profitable growth; however, we have a history of cumulative losses and may have operating losses as we continue to grow our business.\nWe experienced net losses from continuing operations of $0.7 million in fiscal 2016. Although we had net income of $52.9 million and $10.7 million in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, respectively, and positive adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2018, there is no assurance that this will continue into the future. We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years, which may diminish our profitability or lead to losses in the future. In particular, we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in marketing to acquire new, paying members. We also intend to hire additional personnel in product, operations, sales and other areas of our business and to introduce new products, services and features, each of which will increase our expenses with no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue to maintain positive net income. If we are unable to maintain profitability, we may adjust our strategic focus and investments, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations or our assessment that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets related to historic net operating losses will be realized.\nIf we are unable to introduce new and diversified products, services or features that families and caregivers find valuable, we may not be able to attract and retain families and caregivers on our online marketplace or expand our paying family base. Our efforts to develop new and diversified products and services could require us to incur significant costs.\nIn order to continue to attract and retain families and caregivers on our online marketplace and expand our paying family base, we will need to continue to invest in the innovation and development of new and diversified products, services and features that add value for families and caregivers. The success of new and diversified products, services and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the product, service or feature. If families and caregivers do not recognize the value of our new or diversified products, services or features, they may choose not to use our online marketplace or pay for our services.\nAttempting to develop and deliver new or diversified products, services or features involves inherent risks and difficulties, and is costly. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these product developments or that they will work as intended or provide value to families and caregivers. In addition, some new or diversified products, services or features\nmay be difficult for us to market and may also involve unfavorable pricing. Even if we succeed, we cannot guarantee that our members will respond favorably.\nMany individuals use mobile devices to access online services. If we are unable to effectively operate or monetize on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access online services through mobile devices, such as smart phones, handheld tablets and mobile telephones, as opposed to personal computers, has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. In fiscal year 2018, we had an average of over 9.4 million unique visitors to our platform each month, 61% of whom visited our site from mobile devices. In fiscal 2019, we expect the percentage of visitors from mobile devices to increase. If the mobile solutions we have developed do not continue to meet the needs of prospective members or current members, they may not register for our services, they may not become paying members of our services and/or they may reduce their usage of our services and our business could suffer. Additionally, we are dependent on the interoperability of Care.com with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our solutions\u2019 functionality, give preferential treatment to competitive products, prevent our ability to promote our services, or impact how we monetize our services could adversely affect our revenue or operating results.\nOur business depends on the strength of our brand. If we are the subject of negative publicity, if the services we provide fail to meet our members\u2019 expectations, or if inappropriate actions by certain of our members are attributed to us, or if we are the target of lawsuits or investigations, our brand may be damaged, and we may be unable to maintain or expand our base of members and paying families.\nThe strength of our brand is essential to our business. Member awareness, and the perceived value, of our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and the ability of our members to have a consistent, high-quality experience with our service. As a result, we must ensure that our new and existing members are satisfied with our products and services. Negative publicity, complaints or negative views regarding our products or services, irrespective of their validity, could diminish members\u2019 and prospective members\u2019 confidence in and the use of our platform and adversely impact our brand. For example, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, the subject of media reports that cast our business practices or the products and services we provide in a negative light. We have been the subject of media reports that have criticized our ability to detect and remove bad actors from our site. There have also been news reports of alleged criminal conduct by caregivers against families they met through our site, including sexual abuse and conduct resulting in death, and in some cases lawsuits have been filed against Care.com relating to such conduct. In addition, in recent years there has been an increase in fraud perpetrated against caregivers who seek employment opportunities on sites such as ours, and Care.com has been featured in news reports regarding these scams. Regardless of the accuracy of these reports, the validity of their claims or our response, such reports may have the effect of undermining confidence in our brand or increasing the perceived risk of using our services, which could affect our ability to attract and retain paying members and, as a result, negatively impact our results of operations. Even if the effect of such reports on our results of operations is limited, the perception that they could negatively impact our business could cause a decline in the price of our stock disproportionate to the actual harm caused.\nIn addition to news reports, we may be subjected to negative publicity in connection with threatened or ongoing litigation or governmental investigations. Even if such claims or investigations do not have merit, and even if we are able to successfully defend, settle or otherwise resolve them, the publicity they generate, including press releases issued by or statements from our counterparties in the applicable dispute, may be perceived negatively, and may have the effect of harming our brand, negatively affecting our business or causing our stock price to decline.\nThe strength of our brand, and our ability to attract and retain paying members, depends significantly on the experience our members have with one another at the point of service, which we do not control. Conduct by our members may be attributed to us, and as a result inappropriate, illegal or otherwise harmful acts by caregivers or families, even if only by a small number of our members and even if such acts are outside of our control, could result in negative publicity or legal action that could have a significant negative impact on our brand. If our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful or if our member experience is not otherwise positive, our operating results and our ability to attract and retain paying members may be adversely affected and our results of operations may be harmed.\nFurthermore, an adverse, public event resulting from the actions of a caregiver on a competitor\u2019s platform could increase the perceived risk of seeking care or employment through an online platform, and cause our members or prospective members to lose confidence in our services. Such an event could result in harm to our brand even if the member has no relationship with our platform, and as a result could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business and if we are unable to hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly-skilled personnel. Our ability to execute efficiently depends upon contributions from all of our employees, in particular our senior\nmanagement team and employees from key business areas such as product, engineering and analytics. Key institutional knowledge remains with a small group of long-term employees whom we may not be able to retain. We do not have employment agreements other than offer letters with any of our key employees, including our chief executive officer, and we do not currently maintain key person life insurance for any employee. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior management team, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Our growth strategy also depends on our ability to expand and retain our talent pool. Identifying, recruiting, training and integrating qualified individuals require significant time, expense and attention. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining our best talent. Competition for these resources, particularly in Boston, Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, three areas where we have offices, is intense. If we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that our culture has the potential to be a key contributor to our success. As we grow, if we do not continue to develop our corporate culture it could harm our ability to foster the innovation, creativity and teamwork we believe we need to support our growth.\nFinally, we rely on the resources of third parties over whom we have limited control to assist us in developing certain products and features. If any of these third parties terminates its relationship with us or fails to provide adequate services, it could cause delays in our release of new product offerings and/or features and harm our business.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, operating and financial results may suffer.\nWe have recently experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. We expect that our growth strategy will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources. It is important that we appropriately prioritize our efforts and allocate our limited resources effectively. Continued growth also could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our members, to enhance our product offerings, to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, to continue to strengthen our reporting systems and procedures and to recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to scale our systems and infrastructure accordingly and may determine we need to open additional offices, add more network capacity and make other capital investments, which will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. For example, in fiscal 2017 to access additional personnel talent, we made the decision to increase our staffing and resources in the Bay Area, a market which is more expensive and competitive than other markets in which we operate. If we continue to see the need to enter or increase personnel in markets to access specific types of talent, this may increase our expenses going forward. Additionally, if we fail to maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency, or if we fail to appropriately prioritize our efforts and allocate limited resources effectively in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nIf we fail to adapt our operations to meet the increased legal and operational demands of our Care@Work clients, our brand and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nThe significance of our Care@Work offering to commercial clients has grown as we have entered into agreements with large organizations with operations throughout the United States. Meeting our contractual obligations to such organizations has demanded significant management attention, and has required us to undertake a rapid expansion of the scale and complexity of our Care@Work operations. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations to our Care@Work clients, they may be able to terminate their contracts with us or seek damages, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, such failure could result in negative publicity and reputational harm, hurting our brand and making it more difficult for us to keep our current clients and attract new ones. Even if we are successful meeting our obligations under existing contracts with our Care@Work clients, there is no guarantee that such clients will continue their relationships with us through or beyond the initial contractual term. Any termination of a contract by our Care@Work clients would have a negative effect on our results of operations, and could result in negative publicity and reputational harm, hurting our brand and making it more difficult for us to keep our current clients and to engage new clients such that our investments in our Care@Work offering will generate the targeted return.\nIf evolving consumer behavior in the era of mobile devices and messaging/social networking apps hinders our ability to effectively market to and communicate with members and potential members, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEvolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing opportunities. For example, as traditional television viewership declines and as consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, the reach of many of our traditional advertising channels may contract. To continue to reach potential members and grow our businesses, we must identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels, such as mobile and\nonline video platforms as well as targeted campaigns in which we communicate directly with potential, former and current members via new virtual means. Generally, the opportunities in and sophistication of newer advertising channels are relatively undeveloped and unproven, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to appropriately manage and fine-tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as consumers communicate less via email and more via text messaging and other virtual means, the reach of our email campaigns may be adversely impacted. One of our primary means of communicating with our members and keeping them engaged with our products is via email. Our ability to communicate via email enables us to keep our members updated on activity with respect to their job postings or profile, inform them of new members they may be interested in connecting with, introduce them to new products or services they may be interested in using, and present discount and free trial offers, among other things. Any erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our members via email could have an adverse impact on member experience and the rate at which non-paying members become paid members.\nIf we fail to expand and increase adoption of our Care@Work and consumer payments solutions, our future growth could suffer.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to grow our Care@Work solutions. Although we have continued to acquire new customers, our growth could be adversely affected if we are unable to acquire new customers at the same rate or volume as we have in the past. Additionally, our growth could be impacted if we are unable to scale our internal enterprise sales team. As our Care@Work solutions grow, we are increasing the scale of our in-home and in-center back-up care network, as well as the operations required to deliver these services, and we will need to continue to do so in the future. We may also need to further differentiate our Care@Work products and services to effectively compete with our competition. If we fail to continue to acquire new customers, scale our internal enterprise sales team and operations, scale our in-home and in-center back-up care network and differentiate our Care@Work products and services, then our growth may be adversely impacted. For more information about risks related to the growth of our Care@Work solutions, see \u201c-If we fail to adapt our operations to meet the increased legal and operational demands of our Care@Work clients, our brand and results of operations may be negatively impacted,\u201d above.\nAdditionally, as part of our growth strategy, we intend to grow our consumer payments solutions. Although an increasing number of our members are using Care.com HomePay, a household employer payroll and tax product, if this trend does not continue, or if any other payments solutions we may offer do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position could be impaired and our growth could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on search engines and job board sites to attract a significant percentage of our members, and if those businesses change their ranking or listings practices, algorithms or increase their pricing, it could impact our ability to attract new members.\nMany of our members locate our services through search engines, such as Google and Bing. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings, and we rely on both types. Algorithmic listings cannot be purchased and are determined and displayed by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize search result listings. If the search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms in a manner that reduces the prominence of our listing, fewer potential members may find and click through to our services. Additionally, our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization efforts may result in their services receiving greater prominence in search result listings than ours, which could also reduce the number of potential members that visit our services. We have experienced fluctuations in the prominence of our search result listings in the past and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. In addition, costs for purchased listings on search engines have increased in the past and may continue to increase in the future. Price increases could reduce the number of potential members that visit our services and increase our costs. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our services from search engines would harm our business and operating results.\nJob board sites are also an important source of our caregiver acquisition efforts. We derive much of that volume from organic search listings within those job boards. Some job board aggregators have denied certain of our listings, or removed certain listings we have posted. If a greater portion of our listings are denied we may have to find alternative paid sources to acquire caregivers, which would impact our ability to attract new members and increase our acquisition costs.\nData security and integrity are critically important to our business, and breaches of security, unauthorized disclosure of information about our members, denial of service attacks or the perception that member information is not secure could result in a material loss of business, substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the proper functioning and integrity of our technology systems. In the ordinary course of our business, we rely on our systems to collect, process and store a large amount of consumer information,\nincluding financial information and sensitive personal information. In addition, we use our systems to create, transmit and store confidential business and financial information. This information is often accessed through transmissions over public and private networks, including the Internet. Despite our physical security measures, implementation of technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify, detect and prevent the unauthorized access, alteration, use, transmission or disclosure of our data, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures will be sufficient to protect our data or detect any compromise of our data\u2019s security. Our systems are vulnerable to bugs, defects, breakdown, malicious intrusion, random attack and theft. Data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our technology systems, including our employees, contractors or contractual counterparties, or others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be accidentally or deliberately exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. We have been and expect to continue to be targeted by cyber-attacks, which may be carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, \u201chacktivists\u201d and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Several recent, highly publicized data security breaches and denial of service attacks at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems.\nAny unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential business or member information, information, including by cyber attacks or other security breach, could cause a loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, disrupt our operations, expose us to substantial liability under federal, state and foreign laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some laws and regulations mandate notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities in the event that personal data is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons. For example, the GDPR, which was adopted by the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) in 2016 and went into effect in May 2018, includes data breach notification requirements in regard to both affected individuals and E.U. data protection authorities (depending on the facts of the breach) with which we will have to comply. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability.\nWe use, store and, in some instances, share information collected from or about our members and site visitors and their devices, which may subject us to governmental and industry regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store and process information from and about our members and website visitors and their devices, as well as information about Care.com HomePay and back-up care users, including name, contact information, and in some cases sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers, tax return information, bank account numbers, social security numbers and other personal information such as criminal background information and information relating to children and vulnerable individuals. In addition, members using our service can allow us to share information, including personal and background information, with other members and with third parties.\nDiverse legal and industry requirements in the regions where our members and site visitors reside may apply to our collection, use, storage and sharing of information about such individuals, including to the extent that our members choose to share data about themselves or family members in connection with potential employment in the home setting. The scope of these privacy and data protection obligations are changing in substantial and unpredictable ways, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between different regions or conflict with other rules. For example, the E.U.-U.S. Safe Harbor program was invalidated and replaced with the Privacy Shield program in 2016. Privacy Shield has been subject to legal challenges and may not be appropriate for us.\nFor example, the GDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR introduces stringent operational requirements for companies established in the E.U. or European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), or those outside the E.U. or EEA but which are targeting or monitoring individuals located in the E.U. or EEA, including fulfilling new and strengthened rights for data subjects (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data, data portability, etc.) , detailed disclosures to data subjects (including disclosure of the legal basis on which personal data is processed), additional obligations when contracting with service providers, mandatory data breach notification requirements, appropriate privacy governance framework to be implemented including policies, procedures, training and data audit, and increased fines, with potential fines for violations of certain provisions of the GDPR reaching as high as the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of a company\u2019s total annual global revenue. In addition, failure by us, our partners, our vendors, or our employees or contractors to comply with the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well potential civil claims including class actions where individuals suffer harm.\nWe are subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and EEA. While currently we have legally recognized mechanisms in place which are based on E.U. Commission approved model clauses and/or other permitted mechanisms that we believe allow for the transfer of E.U. member, customer, and employee information to the United States and other countries outside of the E.U. and EEA, it is possible that these mechanisms may not be sufficient\nunder the GDPR or other future legal requirements that could have an impact on how we move data to Care.com entities outside the E.U. or EEA. For example, there is currently ongoing litigation in the E.U. challenging the legitimacy of the E.U. Commission approved model clauses as a data export mechanism under the GDPR. As such, it is uncertain whether the model clauses may be invalidated as a compliant data transfer mechanism in the near future.\nIn response to these regulatory changes and the ongoing scrutiny of transfer mechanisms generally, we may be required to find alternative solutions for the compliant transfer of personal data outside the E.U. or EEA and to make changes in regard to our data export processes. We may have to require some of our vendors who process personal data to take on additional privacy and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us to incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. If our policies and practices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient, or if our members and customers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the E.U. or EEA to the United States or other countries outside of the E.U. or EEA, we could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by individual E.U. or EEA data protection authorities or lawsuits by private parties, member engagement could decline and our business could be negatively impacted. The requirements imposed by the GDPR and similar laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions, which together with the costs of compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAs a data controller under GDPR, we are accountable for third-party data vendors or service providers we engage to process personal data on our behalf. We attempt to address the associated risks by implementing various processes designed to mitigate such risks, which include, without limitation, the performance of vendor security reviews, due diligence and other activities. We also enter into agreements with vendors and service providers that access personal data and where required under the GDPR, obligate them to only process data according to our instructions and to take sufficient security measures to protect such data. There is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such data. Any violation of data or security laws by our third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined above.\nWe are also subject to evolving European privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. The E.U. is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation, which will be directly implemented in the laws of each European member state. The draft e-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR (i.e., the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total global annual revenue). While the e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018 (alongside the GDPR), it is still going through the European legislative process and commentators now expect it to be adopted during the second half of 2020 or during 2021 following a transition period.\nWe are subject to evolving privacy regulation under U.S. law as well. A number of proposals are pending before federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, and additional laws and regulations have been passed but are not yet effective, any of which could significantly affect our business. For example, on June 28, 2018, California passed the CCPA, which will go into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA introduces significant changes to privacy law for businesses that collect personal information from California residents, including giving consumers statutory rights that are similar in some ways to those granted to consumers under the GDPR. The CCPA will impose substantial new compliance burdens on businesses subject to the law, and also creates a new potential source of consumer litigation through the private right of action authorized under the statute.\nSome industry requirements subject us to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders, and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply. Our failure to remain fully compliant with the PCI DSS may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply fully may also subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. In addition, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our services or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry requirements relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any other privacy-related legal obligations, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our members and customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as customers, vendors or\ndevelopers, violate applicable laws, their contractual obligations to us or our policies, such violations may also put our members\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.\nComplying with existing and proposed laws, regulations and industry standards applicable to the collection, use, storage and sharing of data about our members and site visitors can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, increase our risk of non-compliance and subject us to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe expansion of our service offerings exposes us to increased litigation risk related to our on-demand caregivers.\nIn connection with new and expanded service offerings, we have increased the number of caregivers we employ for the purpose of providing care to families on an on-demand basis, and have engaged nanny agencies and daycare centers, whose caregivers provide on-demand services to our corporate clients. For example, our subsidiaries Care Concierge, Town & Country and Trusted Labs provide back-up child and adult care to families an on-demand basis. Our relationships with on-demand caregivers and caregivers we employ may increase the likelihood that we will be found liable for caregiver misconduct. Such liability, in individual cases or in the aggregate, could be substantial, and could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, the expansion of our on-demand care offerings has increased the cost of certain related insurance policies. These costs may continue to rise in the future, and there is no guarantee that that the policies we maintain will be sufficient to protect us from all liability, or that they will cover all types of claims that may be made against us.\nIf the businesses we have acquired do not perform as expected or we are unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have acquired complementary businesses in the past. The benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisitions depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings synergies. Our success in realizing these opportunities and synergies and the timing of this realization depend among other things on the successful integration of the acquired companies\u2019 businesses and operations with our businesses and operations and the adoption of our respective best practices. Even if we are able to integrate these businesses and operations successfully and implement those strategic initiatives, it may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and synergies we currently expect to achieve, within the anticipated time frame or at all. If a company we purchase does not perform as we expected, our investment could become impaired or we could discontinue the operations and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technologies, technology platforms and products of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u2022\nlegal or regulatory challenges or litigation post-acquisition, which could result in significant costs or require changes to the businesses or unwinding of the transaction;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flow;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the key customers and business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nour dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions;\n\u2022\nresponsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses, whether such liabilities were disclosed to us or not prior to our acquisition and whether such liabilities meet or exceed our estimates, including, without limitation liabilities arising out of the acquired business\u2019s failure to maintain effective data protection and privacy controls and comply with applicable regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assigning or transferring intellectual property licensed by acquired companies from third parties to us or our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nchallenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating acquired companies\u2019 systems controls, policies and procedures to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u2022\npotential accounting charges to the extent intangibles recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value.\nMoreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to the financial condition of the company, creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property, and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. If any of these representations and warranties are inaccurate or breached, such inaccuracy or breach could result in costly litigation and assessment of liability for which there may not be adequate recourse against such sellers, in part due to contractual time limitations and limitations of liability.\nWe may make acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses in the future, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in dilution to our stockholders, and adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions to add specialized employees, complementary companies, products or technologies. In addition, we may make investments in complimentary businesses. The identification of suitable acquisition or investment candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or investments. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. For any such transaction, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022incur large charges or expenses or assume substantial liabilities;\n\u2022become subject to new laws and regulations about which we have limited prior experience or knowledge;\n\u2022encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.\nAny of these risks could harm our business and operating results. In addition, for legal, technical or business reasons, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of any company we acquire as quickly or fully as we would like. The integration of any acquired company may require, among other things, coordination of administrative, sales and marketing, accounting and finance functions, harmonization of legal terms and privacy policies and expansion of information and management systems.\nAcquisitions can also lead to large non-cash charges that can have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of write-offs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets or goodwill.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill impairment charges from our discontinued operations and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry or our own operations, and/or other materially adverse events that have implications on the profitability of our business. We will need to continue to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined, which could adversely impact our results of operations, prospects and financial position. As of December 29, 2018, our goodwill balance was $68.2 million and our intangible asset balance was $4.1 million, which represented 25% and 2% of total consolidated assets, respectively.\nOur international operations are subject to certain challenges and risks.\nWhile we intend to focus most of our international efforts on growing our existing international markets, we also may expand our international operations in the future. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally\nrequires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. Our international operations require us to invest significant funds and other resources. International expansion also subjects us to numerous risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nproviding products and services across a significant distance, in different languages and among different cultures, including potentially modifying our solutions and features to ensure that they are culturally relevant in different countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, which, in certain areas such as privacy and data protection, for example GDPR, may be more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws, including without limitation compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022higher costs of doing business internationally.\nIf our revenue from our international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations, our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings and investigations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are, and expect in the future to be, subject to litigation and various legal proceedings and/or government investigations, including litigation, proceedings and/or government investigations related to privacy, advertising, other consumer protection laws, contracts, intellectual property or other matters and that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as and when required or appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or estimation and involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe number of our registered families is significantly higher than the number of our paying families and substantially all of our revenue is derived from our paying families.\nThe number of registered members in our marketplace is significantly higher than the number of paying families because some families choose to register, but not become paying families, and others become paying families, but choose not to renew their paid memberships. If we are not able to attract new registered families, convert registered families to paying families or retain our paying families for longer periods of time our business may not grow as fast as we expect, or not at all, which would harm our operating and financial results and may cause our stock price to decline. Therefore, we must provide features and products that demonstrate the value of our marketplace to our members and motivate them to become paying members. If we fail to successfully motivate our members to do so, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business may be harmed if users view our marketplace as primarily limited to finding regularly scheduled caregivers for children.\nOur membership growth and engagement rates could be adversely affected if consumers perceive the utility of our marketplace to be limited to finding full-time caregivers for children. Despite the breadth of care needs that can be met through our platform, including after school care, occasional babysitting, senior care, pet care, tutoring and housekeeping, 33% of job postings in fiscal year 2018 were for full-time child caregivers. If families and caregivers fail to utilize the breadth of the family care and other services available through our marketplace, our membership growth and engagement rates could be negatively impacted, and our business will be harmed.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our platform is accessible, and our business is subject to risks of events outside of our control.\nOur members access information through our websites and mobile apps. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our members depend upon the reliable performance of our websites and mobile apps and the underlying network infrastructure. We have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, service disruptions, outages and other\nperformance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, denial of service attacks, capacity constraints and fraud or security violations. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and if our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when users attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, users may use other services and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract users and increase engagement on our website and mobile apps. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our infrastructure to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in our business and in our technology, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our online services and mobile applications are located in facilities that we do not own or control. Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, floods, fires, power losses, telecommunications failures or acts of war. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as a major snowstorm or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for such losses that may occur. In addition, acts of terrorism could negatively affect our results of operations by causing disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole.\nWe have implemented disaster recovery procedures that allow us to move our services to a back-up operating infrastructure in the event of a catastrophe or other event outside of our control. However, these procedures do not yet provide a real time solution. Therefore, if our primary operating infrastructure becomes due to a catastrophe or other events outside of our control, there will be a period of time that our platform will remain unavailable while the transition to a back-up operating infrastructure takes place. Any period during which our existing members are unable to access our services, or prospective members are unable to register on our website, could negatively affect our business\nInterruptions or delays in service arising from our third-party vendors could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe rely upon third-party vendors to provide certain services upon which we rely, including data center, communications and networking infrastructure services, credit card and payment processing services, background checking services, in-center and in-home back-up care services, email management and delivery services, customer relationship management services and other services critical to our business. The operation of our product and service offerings could be impaired if the availability of these services is interrupted or limited in any way. We have contractual relationships with these parties but do not have physical control over their daily operations, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. If any of these third-party service providers terminates their relationship with us, or does not provide an adequate level of service to our members, it would be disruptive to our business as we seek to replace the service provider or remedy the inadequate level of service.\nIn addition, these service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They also are subject to break-ins, sabotage, acts of vandalism, the failure of physical, administrative, and technical security measures, terrorist acts, human error, financial insolvency and other unanticipated problems or events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our service and unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and data contained on our systems and the content and data that these third-party vendors store and deliver on our behalf.\nWe have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, interruptions and delays in service and availability from third party vendors. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with third-party technologies and services could negatively impact our relationship with our members, our brand and reputation and our ability to attract, retain and serve our members.\nIf we or our service providers fail to process payment transactions effectively and accurately or fail to protect against potential fraudulent activities relating to payment transactions, we may incur expenses and suffer reputational harm.\nWe offer Care.com HomePay, our household employer payroll and tax services. We also offer an electronic payments solution through a third-party payments processor that allows families to make electronic payments to their caregivers through our website and mobile apps. It is possible that we or our service provider may make errors in processing payments or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud. We may also make errors in calculating and remitting taxes to the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. In addition, the online tax preparation, payroll administration and online payments industries have increasingly been subject to fraudulent activities by third parties. In addition to any direct damages and potential fines we may incur as a result of payment processing errors or fraud relating to our payments products, negative publicity or a loss of confidence regarding these services could harm our business and damage our brand.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nWe are and will continue to be faced with many competitive challenges, any of which could adversely affect our prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to our consumer matching solutions, we compete for families, caregivers, employers and care-related businesses with traditional offline consumer resources, online job boards and other online care marketplaces. We also compete for a share of care-related businesses\u2019 overall recruiting and advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers. Our principal competitors are Craigslist, a \u2018\u2018free to consumer\u2019\u2019 website, UrbanSitter and Sittercity, an online care specific marketplace. Our principal competitor in our employer channel is Bright Horizons. In the consumer payments market, Care.com HomePay competes with similar products offered by HomeWork Solutions, Inc., NannyChex and GTM Payroll Services. In addition, we may in the future be subject to competition from companies that operate other online marketplaces and that decide to expand into the online care market or other established companies that decide to expand into the consumer payments market. These potential competitors may be larger and have more resources than we do, may enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. As a result, these potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities or technologies.\nTo compete effectively for members, we must continue to invest significant resources in marketing and in the development of our products and services to enhance their value. To compete effectively for revenue from employers and care-related businesses, we must continue to invest in marketing and in growing our membership. Failure to compete effectively against our current or future competitors could result in loss of current or potential members, which could adversely affect our margins, and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively for members in the future against existing or new competitors, and the failure to do so could result in loss of existing or potential members, reduced membership revenue, increased marketing or selling expenses or diminished brand strength, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may incur liability or other expenses if caregivers or other users of our services engage in inappropriate, harmful or illegal conduct, or if we do not notify our members of alleged inappropriate or illegal conduct.\nFamilies and caregivers have sought, and may seek in the future, damages from us if a caregiver or family does not meet their expectations or causes them harm. Currently, Care.com is a party to several lawsuits brought by members relating to alleged criminal acts by other members they found through the Care.com site, including acts resulting in death. These types of claims also may be brought under foreign laws. If a decision were rendered against us in a claim of this type, we may incur significant liability and/or negative publicity. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, they may result in significant investigation or defense costs, as well as negative publicity. In addition, because there is a particularly low tolerance for failure when seeking care for a loved one, any such claims, events or publicity could have a significant adverse effect on our reputation and brand. Any of these results, particularly damages to our brand and reputation, could adversely affect our financial condition, business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we become aware of information relating to our members through complaints from other members, publicly available sources or otherwise, which results in the removal of the member from our marketplace. Because of the complex legal and regulatory environment in which our business operates, we generally do not advise other members when we decide to remove a particular member and, when we do advise members that we have removed a member, we generally do not tell them the reason for removal. As a result, a member who hires a caregiver through our platform may not be aware that the caregiver has subsequently been removed from our marketplace or the reason the caregiver was removed, and may seek to make a legal claim against us for failure to notify them of the removal or the reason for the removal. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, or any claim by a caregiver that he or she should not have been so removed, may be a distraction to management, result in our incurring costs to defend or settle the claim, may require us to pay damages, or may otherwise harm our business and reputation.\nAdverse economic conditions may adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for care. Our prospective members\u2019 employment and income impact their demand for care. Adverse economic conditions, including increases in unemployment or reductions in labor force participation in general or among our members and prospective members, could reduce the number of dual-income families -a key component of our target market - and therefore the number of families seeking care. In addition, if consumer spending is reduced due to a weak economy, families may decrease spending on care services they believe to be non-essential, such as housekeeping and tutoring, or reduce or eliminate certain activities that typically require the services of our caregivers, such as date nights that require babysitters and vacations that may require pet sitters. As a result, weakened adverse changes in prevailing economic conditions could decrease the traffic on our platform, reduce sales of our products and services and delay adoption of new offerings.\nIf we require additional funds from outside sources in the future, those funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may require additional funds from outside sources in the future, and we may not be able to obtain those funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.\nIf we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient outside funds, we may have to delay development of new product offerings. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs. We also may have to reduce marketing or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these actions could harm our operating results.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, some of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or investigations, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are or may be found to be subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws and regulations that affect consumer-based businesses and companies that conduct business on the Internet. Because our services are accessible worldwide, we are also subject to laws and regulations in jurisdictions, both in the United States and internationally, in which we have no operations. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, information security and data protection, use of consumer background information, intellectual property, electronic contracts, consumer protection, telecommunications, taxation, securities law compliance and online payment services. Many jurisdictions have passed laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, that impose new restrictions and obligations in connection with the collection, storage, use, transmittal and retention of consumer data, and other jurisdictions are considering such laws. These laws require the adoption of operating standards that can be vaguely defined and difficult, expensive and time consuming to implement. Many of these laws are new and remain untested. As a result, the costs of complying with these laws may increase in the future as they are interpreted and standards coalesce around their implementation. These laws have imposed, and will continue to impose, substantial new compliance burdens, and will expand our litigation and regulatory enforcement risks.\nBeyond information security and data privacy, we are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection laws and regulations that affect, and in many cases restrict, the manner in which we are permitted to operate. Our compliance with these laws and regulations is monitored by governmental authorities, many of which have the power to launch investigations, or to cause legal proceedings to be commenced against us. For example, we offer members a paid subscription service that auto-renews until downgraded to a non-paying membership. Many states have enacted laws specific to auto-renewing contracts and other states are considering such laws. Among other things, these laws may require specific notifications to consumers prior to and/or after a consumer agrees to an auto-renewing contract, including reminder notifications prior to a subscription renewing, and may specify the manner in which such notifications are given. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and variations and inconsistencies among jurisdictions in their scope and interpretation may further increase the cost of compliance and litigation risk. We have been, and from time to time may become, subject to legal proceedings and/or government investigations relating to our compliance with state auto-renewing contract laws. Complying with investigations can subject us to increased costs and adverse publicity even if no violations are found. Violation of a state auto-renew law can result in civil penalties and in many instances renders the contract unenforceable, which could result in a refund of all fees paid under the contract. Likewise, we are subject to laws and regulations regarding unfair or deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations can be interpreted to apply to content on our website, communications we make to our members and marketing materials we place with third parties or transmit to prospective or current members. We have been and are currently subject to regulatory investigations in connection with our auto-renew practices and compliance with unfair and deceptive trade practices laws. For more information about investigations related to our auto-renew practices, see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d The penalties, fees and expenses we incur in these investigations could be significant, either individually or in the aggregate. Changes to our practices in these or other areas that are required by law or as a result of investigations, or that we deem are advisable in light of the business and regulatory environments in which we operate, may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIn the United States we acquire information about our members from consumer credit reporting agencies and other third-party sellers of public data. We use this information in an effort to verify the accuracy of certain information that some of our members provide about themselves and to advance our business objective to maintain a trusted online community for our members. We also facilitate the purchase and sharing of third-party consumer reports and background checks by members, subject to the permission of the individual who is the subject of the report. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, or the FCRA, applies to consumer credit reporting agencies as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports, as those terms are defined in the FCRA. The FCRA promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes, including for employment. The FCRA limits the distribution and use of consumer reports and establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, among other rights and obligations. Members who access consumer reports about job applicants via our service expressly agree to follow the FCRA requirements for employers. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and state attorneys\u2019 general, acting alone or in cooperation with one another, actively enforce the FCRA as do private litigants. Many states have enacted laws with requirements similar to the FCRA. Some of these laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA.\nIn addition, the payment processing and tax preparation industries are receiving heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, litigation by the government or private entities or new interpretations of existing laws may subject us to additional legal or regulatory oversight or obligations, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our payment processing and tax preparation businesses or offer our payment processing and tax products and services. This in turn may increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with current or new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties and other liabilities.\nIf we are not able to comply with existing or new laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain services, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased public attention to liability that could result from lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.\nOur practices surrounding the auto-renewal of our paid subscriptions have been, and may in the future be, the subject regulatory scrutiny and litigation.\nWe offer members a paid subscription service that auto-renews until downgraded to a non-paying membership. Many states have enacted laws specific to auto-renewing contracts and other states are considering such laws. Among other things, these laws may require specific notifications to consumers prior to and/or after a consumer agrees to an auto-renewing contract, including reminder notifications prior to a subscription renewing, and may specify the manner in which such notifications are given. Governmental investigations in connection with these laws can result in increased legal fees and settlements that require the payment of fines, changes to our business practices, or both. Violations of a state auto-renew laws can result in civil penalties and in many instances render the contract unenforceable, which could result in a refund of all fees paid under the contract. We have been and are subject to regulatory investigations in connection with our auto-renew practices. For example, the Marin County District Attorney\u2019s Office is conducting an investigation related to the clarity and conspicuousness of our automatic renewal disclosures and the mechanism by which we obtain informed consent when members purchase premium subscriptions on our website. Any changes to our auto-renew practices that are required in connection with these investigations, that are required by law or that we deem are necessary or appropriate in light of the business and regulatory environments in which we operate may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nWe could be subjected to lawsuits or investigations in numerous jurisdictions, including those in which we do not have any operations.\nBecause our services are accessible worldwide, we are subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in the United States and abroad, including jurisdictions in which we have no local entity, employees, infrastructure or operations. We could be subjected to investigations or litigation in any number of these jurisdictions. Lawsuits or investigations in one jurisdiction could make similar lawsuits or investigations in other jurisdictions more likely, and even if we are able to successfully defend, settle or otherwise resolve an investigation or litigation in one jurisdiction, there is no guarantee we will be successful doing so in other jurisdictions. As a result, even disputes or allegations of non-compliance that are insignificant on an individual basis could, if duplicated in other jurisdictions, aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs we develop and sell new products, services and features, we may be subject to additional and unexpected regulations, which could increase our costs or otherwise harm our business.\nAs we develop and sell new products, services and features to our members, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. For example, we offer our convenience payments product to our members through a third party. If, in the future, we provide this product directly to our members, we would be subject to complex financial regulations. We may also become subject to financial regulations as we develop additional payment and financial solutions for our members. In addition, if we expand our offerings to include more personalized services, we may become subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of children, seniors and/or prospective employees.\nOur failure to accurately anticipate the application of laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim are applicable to new products and services we may offer, or other failures to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, including curtailing or withdrawing entirely from one or more lines of business, which could hurt our brand or cause our revenue to decrease, our costs to increase or our business otherwise to be harmed.\nWe could face liability or other expenses for information on or accessible through our online marketplace, including background check reports.\nWe offer families the ability to purchase and view through our marketplace background checks, including criminal background checks, of caregivers they are interesting in hiring, subject to the caregivers\u2019 consent. We contract with third-agencies that we believe are reputable to offer a variety of background checks that range in cost and comprehensiveness. For various reasons, including federal and state law limitations, state and county criminal record reporting system limitations, and human and electronic misstatements or errors, even the most comprehensive background check offered may not disclose the existence of all criminal records in all jurisdictions. Even though we disclose to families that the background checks they purchase and/or view through our marketplace are not comprehensive and may not be accurate or complete, we are and may continue to be subject to lawsuits alleging that background checks offered through our marketplace failed to completely or accurately disclose the criminal history of a caregiver, which resulted in the family hiring the caregiver and experiencing a loss for which we are responsible. We are, and in the future may be, subject to government investigations and inquiries into whether we failed to adequately describe or disclose the limitations of background checks offered through our marketplace. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigations or government proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to successfully defend or favorably resolve a litigation, proceeding or investigation, publicity surrounding such litigation, proceeding or investigation could have a negative effect on our reputation and brand, which could harm our business and cause our stock price to fall.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the information available through our online marketplace, including job postings, caregiver profiles and photographs, is submitted by families, caregivers and third parties. We also allow care-related businesses and other third parties to advertise their products and services on our websites and include links to third-party websites. We could be exposed to liability with respect to this information. Members could assert that information concerning them on our website contains errors or omissions and/or seek damages from us for losses incurred if they rely upon incorrect information provided by our members, care-related businesses or others. We could also be subject to claims that the persons posting information on our websites do not have the right to post such information or are infringing the rights of third parties, such as copyrights in photographs and privacy and publicity rights. Among other things, we might be subject to claims that by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties, we are liable for wrongful actions by the third parties operating those websites. These claims also may be brought under foreign laws that often do not provide the same protections for online services companies that laws in the United States do. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims even if they do not result in liability to us.\nWe also allow families to submit reviews of caregivers. Our terms of use prohibit members from providing inaccurate, misleading, defamatory or false information to us or to any other user of our website and that all opinions expressed must be genuinely held. However, we do not have a regular practice of verifying the accuracy of all of the information provided by our members. There is a risk that a review or other content posted by a member may be considered defamatory or otherwise offensive, objectionable or illegal under applicable law. We also have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we failed to detect and remove unsafe members from our website based content provided in reviews. Therefore, there is a risk that publication on our website of our ratings and reviews may result in a suit against us for defamation, civil rights infringement, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, invasion of privacy, personal injury, discrimination, or other legal claims. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, they may result in costly and time-consuming litigation and/or injury to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions, to safeguard our intellectual property. We do not have any patents or pending patent applications. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our digital content, aspects of our solutions for members, our technology, software, branding and functionality, or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. As we expand internationally, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur digital content is not protected by any registered copyrights or other registered intellectual property. Rather, our digital content is protected by statutory and common law rights, user agreements that limit access to and use of our data and by technological measures. Compliance with use restrictions is difficult to monitor, and our proprietary rights in our digital content databases may be more difficult to enforce than other forms of intellectual property rights.\nWe hold several registered trademarks in the United States, including \u2018\u2018Care.com\u2019\u2019, which is registered on the principal register. We also hold registered trademarks in the E.U., Germany and Canada. Some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive trademark protection. Trademark protection may also not be available, or sought by us, in every country in which our service may become available. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, or purchase our trademarks and confusingly similar terms as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly confusing consumers and caregivers.\nWe currently hold the \u2018\u2018Care.com\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Betreut.de\u2019\u2019, \u201cmyhomepay.com\u201d and \u2018\u2018Breedlove.com\u2019\u2019 Internet domain names and various other domain names. Domain names generally are regulated by Internet regulatory bodies. If we lose the ability to use a domain name in the United States or any other country, we would be forced to incur significant additional expense to market our solutions, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials, which could substantially harm our business and operating results. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain the domain names that utilize the \u2018\u2018Care\u2019\u2019 name or other names we utilize in all of the countries in which we currently intend to conduct business.\nIn order to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our personnel, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and confidential information and, in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors being able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop technology similar to ours or competing technologies, could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nInternet, technology and social media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. Some own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims against us. We have received in the past and may in the future receive notices asserting that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot assure you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or copyright rights; cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content or materials; and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial\ncondition. In addition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will be detected.\nOur revenue may be negatively affected if we are required to charge sales tax or other transaction taxes on all or a portion of our past and future sales in jurisdictions where we are currently not collecting and reporting tax.\nWe currently only charge and collect sales or other transaction taxes in certain of the jurisdictions where our members reside. A successful assertion by any state, local jurisdiction or country in which we do not charge and collect such taxes that we should be collecting sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, or the imposition of new laws requiring the collection of sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales, create increased administrative burdens or costs, reduce demand for our products or services, decrease our ability to compete if competitors lower their fees to offset the tax but we do not or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nAny inability of the Company to realize its deferred tax assets, if and when they arise, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax credits. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability and capital gain generation. Although we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, some or all of our deferred tax assets could expire unused if we are unable to generate taxable income of an appropriate character and in a sufficient amount to utilize these tax benefits in the future. Any determination that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. This charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance and actual results. As a result, significant management judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The changes in the estimates and assumptions used in such assessments and decisions can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in our (benefit from) provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur (benefit from) provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by the following:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets;\n\u2022foreign or domestic income tax assessments and any related tax interest or penalties;\n\u2022expiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022tax effects of nondeductible compensation;\n\u2022adjustments to the pricing of intercompany transactions and transfers of intellectual property or other assets;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles; or\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and regulations, including changes in taxation of the services provided by our foreign subsidiaries.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, that if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. The outcomes of these examinations might have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 29, 2018, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $137.2 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of $116.9 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change,\u2019\u2019 the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u2018\u20185-percent shareholders\u2019\u2019 that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to significant limitations.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government recently enacted comprehensive federal income tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the recently-enacted legislation could create additional operational cost for our Care.com HomePay service and/or adversely affect the tax position of caregivers, which may negatively impact our revenue from that service. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect purchasers or holders of our common stock. We urge current and prospective stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nWe may not be able to successfully prevent others, including copycat websites and mobile apps, from misappropriating our content.\nFrom time to time, third parties have attempted to misappropriate our content through website scraping, search robots or other means. We have deployed several technologies designed to detect and prevent such efforts. However, we may not be able to successfully detect and prevent all such efforts in a timely manner or assure that no misuse of our content occurs.\nIn addition, third parties operating \u2018\u2018copycat\u2019\u2019 websites have attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our service. When we have become aware of such efforts by other companies, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may not be able to detect all such efforts in a timely manner, or at all, and even if we could, the technological and legal measures available to us may be insufficient to stop their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of companies operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the damage to our business caused by such websites or mobile apps. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operation of these third parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources and have a significantly adverse effect on our brand.\nSome of our solutions contain open-source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open-source software in our solutions and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software and/or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and expect to remain an emerging growth company until the end of our fiscal 2019 fiscal year. We will no longer be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined by the JOBS Act as of fiscal 2019 year-end. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not included all of the executive compensation-related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These expenses are likely to increase once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe are continually evaluating these rules and regulations and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the E.U. may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which the majority of eligible members of the electorate in the U.K. voted to approve the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u00ecBrexit.\u00ee As a result of the referendum, the U.K. government served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union on March 29, 2017 to formally initiate a withdrawal process. The U.K and the E.U. have had a two-year period under Article 50 to negotiate the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. The withdrawal agreement and political declaration that were endorsed at a special meeting of the European Council on November 25, 2018 did not receive the approval of the U.K. Parliament in January 2019.\nFurther discussions are ongoing, although the European Commission has stated that the E.U. will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. Any extension of the negotiation period for withdrawal will require the consent of all 27 remaining member states of the E.U.\nA withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.\nThe Brexit vote has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. The announcement of Brexit vote and the proposed withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Such global economic uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nShares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in January 2014 at a price of $17.00 per share and, from the date our common stock first traded on the New York Stock Exchange through March 1, 2019 our common stock has subsequently traded as high as $29.25 and as low as $4.89. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u2022our operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022the number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022threatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations relating to our solutions;\n\u2022any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022large volumes of sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022general political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for the stock of technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, cease coverage of our company or make projections that exceed our actual results, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is and will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFurthermore, such analysts publish their own projections regarding our actual results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if we fail to meet securities and industry analysts\u2019 projections.\nShort sellers of our stock have been, and may in the future be, manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. In the past, the publication of such commentary about us by a disclosed short seller precipitated a decline in the market price of our common stock. Efforts by such short seller or by other short sellers, whether or not they identify themselves as such, may have a similar effect, and no assurances can be made that any such effect would be temporary or insignificant.\nOur management has broad discretion over our existing cash resources and might not use such funds in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nOur management generally has broad discretion over the use of our cash resources, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these resources. Our management might not apply these resources in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nConcentration of ownership among our officers, directors, large stockholders and their affiliates may prevent new investors, from influencing corporate decisions.\nOur officers, directors and their affiliated funds and certain of our principal stockholders beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they will have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different from yours. For example, because some of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the price at which shares are currently being sold to the public and have held their shares for a relatively longer period, they may be more interested in selling the company to an acquirer than other investors or may want us to pursue strategies that are different from the wishes of other investors.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe never have declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their shares of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nRisks Related to Our Series A Preferred Stock\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to CapitalG LP reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, dilutes the ownership of such holders, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could discourage a change in control of our company.\nOn June 29, 2016, we completed the sale of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to CapitalG LP (\u201cCapitalG\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of $46.35 million pursuant to an Investment Agreement, dated June 29, 2016, between us and CapitalG (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d). As of June 29, 2016, these shares represented approximately 13.7% of our outstanding common stock, on an as-converted basis. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 5.5% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. The dividends are to be paid in-kind over a seven-year period.\nAs holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock to CapitalG, and the subsequent payment of in-kind dividends, effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We granted CapitalG customary registration rights in respect of any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by CapitalG, or transferees of our Series A Preferred Stock, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nCapitalG is owned by Alphabet Inc., a multinational conglomerate whose portfolio encompasses several industries and includes numerous companies, including Google LLC It is possible that CapitalG\u2019s affiliation with companies such as Google LLC may deter other companies from exploring acquisition opportunities of the company, particularly if those potential acquirers view Google LLC or other companies affiliated with CapitalG as competitors.\nCapitalG may exercise influence over us, including through their ability to designate and the ability of the Series A Preferred Stock holders to elect a member of our Board of Directors, and their interests may not always be aligned with the holders of our common stock.\nAs of December 29, 2018, CapitalG is the beneficial owner of approximately 13.6% of our outstanding common stock, on an as converted basis, making CapitalG our largest stockholder. Moreover, the ongoing payment of in-kind dividends to CapitalG is expected to increase the company\u2019s ownership interest in our company. CapitalG is in the business of making investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, and they may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement and the Series A Preferred Stock, for so long as CapitalG or its affiliates beneficially own at least 50% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased from us pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect one director to our board, with CapitalG having the right to designate the nominee for such position. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of a director designated by CapitalG may differ from the interests of our stockholders as a whole or of our other directors.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of CapitalG or other holders of Series A Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights or put rights, including the right to require us to repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock on any date after June 29, 2023, at 100% of the Liquidation Preference thereof plus all Accrued but Unpaid Dividends, and the right to require us to repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock upon certain change of control events at 150% of the then current Liquidation Preference plus all Accrued but Unpaid Dividends.\nThese preferential rights could result in divergent interests between CapitalG or other holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock. Moreover, the repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14378, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CRCM"}
