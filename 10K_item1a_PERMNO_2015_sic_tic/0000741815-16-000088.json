{"cik": "741815", "company": "HOOPER HOLMES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all the information included in this Report, particularly the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in our shares of common stock. Additional risks not presently known to or understood by us may also negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and need to obtain cash flow from operations or adequate funding to fund our comprehensive recovery plan raise doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn their report dated March 30, 2016, which is also included in this Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern; however, our recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and liquidity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern (which contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future). These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nReduction in cash flow from operations in 2016 may limit our ability to make the desired level of investment in our businesses and may lead to liquidity issues.\nWe have taken steps to address and correct the primary causes of recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and liquidity concerns through the sale of the discontinued Portamedic, Heritage Labs, and Hooper Holmes Services businesses, the acquisition of AHS, and raising additional equity. We used approximately $6.3 million of cash in operations in 2015. If the revenue growth in our Health and Wellness operations does not continue as expected, our cost reduction measures are not successful, or we are unable to maintain our current receivable collection results, we may be unable to make needed investments in our businesses or to comply with our debt covenants and have sufficient eligible receivables to maintain borrowing capacity under our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement.\nOur liquidity may be adversely affected by the terms of our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement.\nIf we need to borrow in the future under our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement, as amended on March 28, 2013, July 9, 2014, April 17, 2015, August 10, 2015, November 10, 2015, and March 28, 2016, the amount available for borrowing may be less than the $7 million under this facility at any given time due to the manner in which the maximum available amount is calculated. We have an available borrowing base subject to reserves established at the lender's discretion of 85% of Eligible Receivables up to $7 million under this facility. As discussed in Note 2, the maximum borrowing capacity on the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement was reduced from $10 million to $7 million pursuant to the Third Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Third Amendment\") on April 17, 2015, (subject to increase to up to $12 million in certain circumstances, subject to the Senior Lender\u2019s consent, as provided in the Loan and Security Agreement) and the expiration was extended through February 28, 2019. Eligible Receivables do not include certain receivables deemed ineligible by the Senior Lender pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (\"the Second Amendment\"). On August 10, 2015, we entered into and consummated a Fourth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Fourth Amendment\") which added the AHS receivables to the borrowing base. As of December 31, 2015, there were $3.3 million borrowings outstanding under the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement with available borrowing capacity of $0.4 million. Average available borrowing capacity for the month of March 2016 was $0.4 million, and we had $2.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 28, 2016.\nThe 2013 Loan and Security Agreement and the Third Amendment contain various covenants, including financial covenants which require us to achieve a minimum EBITDA amount (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization). As of December 31, 2015, we had not met the minimum EBITDA covenant of $0.8 million and have obtained a Waiver and Sixth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Sixth Amendment\") related to the minimum EBITDA measurement period ended December 31, 2015. The Sixth Amendment also modified the covenants going forward. Refer to Note 2 for the modified covenant requirements. There can be no assurance that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. Obtaining a waiver and modifying the financial covenants depends on matters that are outside of management\u2019s control and there can be no assurance that management will be successful in these regards. If we are unable to comply with financial covenants in 2016 and in the\nevent that we were unable to modify the covenants, find new or additional lenders, or raise additional equity, we would be considered in default, which would then enable the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding and exercise remedies with respect to collateral, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOn February 25, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement (\u201cFirst Amendment\u201d) with SWK Funding LLC (\"SWK\"). The First Amendment modifies the Credit Agreement dated April 17, 2015, to extend the date the Company has to issue the additional warrant to SWK to purchase common stock valued at $1.25 million from February 28, 2016, to April 30, 2016, if the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement is not repaid in full and terminated and all liens securing the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement are not released. The issuance of such additional warrant would cause additional dilution to our stockholders and may adversely impact our stock price.\nWe incurred additional indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of AHS, and such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations and did result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe entered into and consummated the Credit Agreement and used the proceeds of the $5.0 million Term Loan to partially fund the purchase of AHS and pay certain fees and expenses related to the Acquisition. As a result, we have indebtedness that is substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to the Acquisition of AHS. This higher level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other investments, and use for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates on our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates or when such indebtedness is being refinanced;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges related to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nWe cannot assure you that cash flows from operations, combined with any additional borrowings available to us, will be obtainable in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants, including financial covenants. As of December 31, 2015, we had not met the minimum aggregate revenue amount of $34 million and have obtained a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the \"Second Amendment\") related to the aggregate revenue measurement period ended December 31, 2015. The Second Amendment removed the minimum aggregate revenue covenant for December 31, 2015, and modified the covenants going forward. Refer to Note 2 for the modified covenant requirements. If we are not able to comply with these revised covenants or obtain additional amendments to the Credit Agreement, the debt may be called by the lender.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate AHS into our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn April 17, 2015, we completed the Acquisition of AHS. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized, or if realized, the timing of realization. The cost of integrating acquired businesses, or our failure to integrate them successfully into our existing businesses, could result in the incurrence of unanticipated expenses and losses. Some risks associated with integrating acquired businesses include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from operations;\n\u2022\nability to retain the clients of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe lingering effects of poor client relations or service performance by the acquired business, which also may taint our existing businesses;\n\u2022\nthe inability to retain the desirable management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nability to fully realize the desired synergies, efficiencies and economies of scale;\n\u2022\nability to establish, implement or police the acquired business's adherence to our existing standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nexposure to client, employee and other legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\naccounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen obstacles and costs in the integration process.\nIn addition, any acquired business could perform significantly worse than expected. Any difficulties encountered in integrating AHS could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeakness in the economy in general, or the financial health or performance of the healthcare industry and healthcare sponsors in particular, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive our revenues from customers in the healthcare industry, including healthcare sponsors. If the condition of the U.S. economy weakens in certain areas, such as an increase in unemployment rates, demand for biometric screenings may decline in the future, resulting in less business for our Company. If some of our healthcare customers fail or curtail operations in the healthcare industry, such failures or curtailments of operations would result in less business for our Company. Either event would negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business results would be adversely affected if we were alleged or found to have violated certain regulatory requirements.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of state and federal regulation. For example, our operations are subject to regulations regarding licensing (supervision of phlebotomists, the conduct of certain specimen draws, and requirements for conducting health screening fairs). We are subject to federal and state laws, including testing and collection regulations and HIPAA rules, regarding security and privacy of personal health information and other personal information. Although we devote substantial effort to comply with these regulatory requirements, there is a continuing risk that regulators may find compliance violations, which could subject us to significant liability and/or damage our relationship with our customers.\nOur business results may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and deploy health professionals and other medical personnel.\nWe believe a key to growth in our Health and Wellness operations is maintaining and managing a large, national network of highly trained medical personnel who can meet our customers' needs in markets nationwide. Although many of our health professionals also work for competitors, our goal is to offer them equal or greater opportunities so that they will be available to provide services to our customers. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriate base of health professionals, it may limit our ability to maintain and/or grow our screening business.\nFuture claims arising from the sale of our business units (discontinued operations) could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf claims for which we may be liable arise related to our previous discontinued operations in the future, this may result in additional cost to us which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a limited number of customers and a loss of some or all of the business of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMuch of our Health and Wellness business is derived through our relationships with our channel partners. Our two largest channel partners, combined, account for more than 30% of our consolidated revenue and accounts receivable balances. While we have agreements with each of our channel partners, the vast majority of the agreements do not provide for any specified minimum level of purchases of services from us. If one or more of our channel partners was to significantly reduce its purchases of biometric screening and other sample collection services from us, it could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. If this were to occur, we would face significant challenges in replacing the lost revenues.\nA number of circumstances could prompt the loss of one or more of our key customers or a substantial portion of its or their business. For example, if one of our customers were to be acquired by or merged into another company for whom we do not provide services, we could lose the acquired company\u2019s business. We could lose one or more significant customers if they perceive one or more of our competitors to be superior in price or quality and choose not to renew our contract.\nCompetition could negatively impact our business.\nThe health and wellness industry is competitive, which could result in loss of our market share due to pressure to reduce prices or increase services without charging additional fees. For screenings, we compete primarily with private companies who provide screenings in certain geographic areas in the United States with few having the ability to service customers nationally like we do. For health and wellness, we compete primarily with established wellness and care management providers, startup companies, and health plans that offer their own proprietary solutions. We are one of the only health and wellness providers that offers a fully integrated, end-to-end screening and wellness solution to our customers which we believe gives us an advantage over our competitors who also serve companies with 500 to 5,000 employees, our primary target market. If one of the national health and wellness companies that currently focuses on larger employers were to develop a service offering in our target market at a lower price point than we offer, we could lose market share or be forced to cut our prices and lose margin in order to retain customers.\nWe are dependent on Clinical Reference Laboratory, Inc. as our exclusive laboratory services provider. If CRL fails to perform adequately under the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement or we face difficulties in managing our relationship with CRL, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement (\"LLASA\") between the Company and CRL, which became effective August 31, 2014, CRL is the Company\u2019s exclusive provider, with certain limited exceptions, of laboratory testing and reporting services in support of the Company\u2019s Health and Wellness offerings. The LLASA has a term of 5 years and will automatically renew for an additional 5 year period unless sooner terminated. Our dependence on CRL makes our operations vulnerable to CRL\u2019s failure to perform adequately under our contract with them. In addition, the services that CRL renders to us are services that we are required to provide under contracts with our clients, and we are responsible for such performance and could be held accountable by the client for any failure to perform. The LLASA has service level requirements of CRL and we perform ongoing oversight activities to identify any performance or other issues related to our relationship with CRL. If CRL were to fail to provide the services that we require or expect, or fails to meet its contractual requirements, such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to serve our customers and/or subject us to regulatory or litigation risk. Such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we cannot successfully implement, maintain and upgrade our information technology platforms so that we can meet customer requirements, the competitiveness of our businesses will suffer.\nThe speed and accuracy with which we make information available to our customers is critical. As a result, we are dependent on our information technology platforms and our ability to store, retrieve, process, manage and enable timely and secure customer access to the health-related and other data we gather on behalf of our customers. Disruption of the operation of our IT systems for any extended period of time, loss of stored data, programming errors or other system failures could cause customers to turn elsewhere to address their service needs. In addition, we must continue to enhance our IT systems, with potentially substantial cost, as the need for service, product and technology requirements advances. In addition, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, and spamming could harm our business and results of operations.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health professionals or other personnel could result in claims against us and/or our incurring expenses to indemnify our clients.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health or other medical professionals could result in claims against us, require us to indemnify our clients for any harm they may suffer, or damage our reputation and relationships with important clients. Our clients rely on the accuracy of the medical data we gather on their behalf in aggregated form to manage their wellness program. We maintain professional liability insurance and such other coverage as we believe appropriate, but such insurance may prove insufficient. Regardless of insurance, any such claims could damage our reputation and relationships with important clients.\nOur classification of most of our health professionals in many states as independent contractors, rather than employees, exposes us to possible litigation and legal liability.\nSome state agencies have claimed that we improperly classified our health professionals as independent contractors for purposes of state unemployment and/or workers compensation tax laws and that we were therefore liable for taxes in arrears, or for penalties for failure to comply with such state agencies\u2019 interpretations of the laws. In some states, our classification of health professionals has been upheld and in others it has not. However, there are no assurances that we\nwill not be subject to similar claims in other states in the future, nor are there any assurances that those states which have previously upheld our position concerning the classification of our contractors will continue to do so in the future. In addition to these state actions, we could be subject to federal tax liability if our classification of workers were determined, for federal employment tax purposes, to be incorrect.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by the effects of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism.\nOur operations would be adversely affected in the event of a natural disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, or an act of terrorism. A natural disaster or act of terrorism could disrupt our ability to provide testing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our Health and Wellness operations.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address that weakness or if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOn April 17, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Accountable Health Solutions, Inc. In connection with this acquisition, we have identified certain deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that we deemed to be a material weakness. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We determined that the complexities of the accounting for this non-routine transaction adversely affected management\u2019s review of the accounting for non-routine, complex technical accounting matters to ensure proper application of generally accepted accounting principles in a timely manner.\nWhile the material weakness continues to exist, we have taken steps to address this weakness in internal control. Management has hired a new corporate controller and also plans to enhance its controls related to non-routine transactions by supplementing with additional resources as necessary, enhancing the design and documentation of management review controls, and improving the documentation of internal control procedures. Despite these measures and planned improvements, our remediation efforts could be insufficient to address the material weakness in the future.\nWe must increase our shareholders\u2019 equity by May 8, 2017, to avoid a delisting action by the NYSE MKT.\nThe NYSE MKT notified us on December 9, 2015, that we have fallen out of compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide because we reported shareholders\u2019 equity of less than $4.0 million in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and we have had net losses in our four most recent fiscal years. As a result, we were required to submit a plan to regain compliance prior to May 8, 2017. The NYSE MKT accepted the plan. If we fail to fulfill it in the allotted time, our shares may be delisted from the Exchange. In addition, as we reported a net loss for the year ending December 31, 2015, we have had net losses for five consecutive years, which increases our shareholders\u2019 equity requirement to $6.0 million. We believe the successful completion of the rights offering and additional private equity obtained (refer to Note 17) supports our efforts to satisfy this higher shareholders\u2019 equity requirement, but if we fail to raise sufficient shareholders\u2019 equity by May 8, 2017, our shares could be delisted.\nA continued low trading price on the NYSE MKT could lead the Exchange to take actions toward delisting our stock.\nThe NYSE MKT notified us on February 4, 2016, that we have fallen out of compliance with Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide because our common stock has been trading at levels viewed as abnormally low for a substantial period of time. Our stock has traded at prices less than $0.20 for much of the past several months. In addition, the NYSE MKT has advised us that its policy is to suspend trading in shares of, and commence delisting procedures with respect to, a listed company if the market price of its shares falls below $0.06 per share. The notice required the Company to remedy its low trading price no later than August 4, 2016. Our compliance plan mentioned above, submitted to and accepted by the NYSE MKT, addresses this issue as well, but if we are not able to remedy our low trading price no later than August 4, 2016, our shares could be delisted.", "PERMNO": 42455, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "HPHWQ"}
