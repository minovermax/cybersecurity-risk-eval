RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business and operations, growth, reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.\nProduct and Commercialization Risks\nCertain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\nHIV Products\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. During 2021, sales of our HIV products accounted for approximately 60% of our total product sales. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) efforts. For example, many of our HIV products contain tenofovir alafenamide (\u201cTAF\u201d), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics, and any changes to the treatment paradigm for HIV may cause nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor.\nVeklury\nWe face risks related to our supply and distribution of Veklury, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) in October 2020 as a treatment for patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and in January 2022 as a treatment for non-hospitalized adult and adolescent patients who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. While the utilization of Veklury has largely tracked rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations, we are unable to accurately predict our revenues or supply needs over the short and long term due to the dynamic nature of the pandemic, including the availability, uptake and effectiveness of vaccines and alternative treatments for COVID-19, fluctuating hospital utilization rates, the emergence of new variants and timing of surges in infection. If we do not accurately forecast demand or manufacture Veklury at levels sufficient to meet demand, then we may experience product shortages or build excess inventory that may be written off. We also remain subject to significant public attention and scrutiny over the complex decisions made regarding clinical data, supply, allocation, distribution and pricing of Veklury, all of which affects our corporate reputation.\nCell Therapy\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Yescarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor (\u201cCAR\u201d) T cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\u2022educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by FDA;\n\u2022securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n\u2022developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient\u2019s T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n\u2022conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. While FDA has approved some cell therapies, including Yescarta and Tecartus, we must continue to demonstrate to the medical community the potential advantages of cell therapy compared to existing and future therapeutics. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Yescarta and Tecartus, see also \u201cOur existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and other discounts on our products and other pricing pressures.\u201d\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients\u2019 white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients\u2019 white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Yescarta or Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.\nWe operate a new automated manufacturing facility in Frederick, Maryland. The facility is pending FDA approval for commercial manufacturing and, even if we obtain such approval, we have not manufactured our products in an automated facility on a commercial scale. As a result, we may not be able to produce or otherwise obtain an amount of supply sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. If we are unable to meet product demand, we will have difficulty meeting sales forecasts for products that we plan to manufacture at this facility.\nOur success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products.\nIf we are unable to launch commercially successful new products or new indications for existing products, our business will be adversely impacted. The launch of commercially successful products is necessary to grow our business, cover our substantial R&D expenses, and offset revenue losses when existing products lose market share due to factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in drug development and the introduction of new products. The product development cycle is characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times and unpredictable outcomes due to the nature of developing medicines for human use. We expend significant time and resources on our product pipeline without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment.\nWe face challenges in accurately forecasting sales because of the difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns or wholesaler inventories.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict demand for our products, including the uptake of new products, as demand depends on a number of factors. For example, product demand may be adversely affected if physicians do not see the benefit of our products. Additionally, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarter-over-quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our products. Federal and state budget pressures, as well as the annual grant cycles for federal and state funds, may cause purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand for our products. We expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers. In light of the budget crises faced by many European countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some government agencies and other purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels, and we may continue to see this trend in the future.\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the United States exclusively through the wholesale channel. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 91% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end-user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end-user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end-user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesaler locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers\u2019 orders from us, even if end-user demand has not changed. In addition, we have observed that strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases of our products in the fourth quarter typically results in inventory draw-down by wholesalers and sub-wholesalers in the subsequent first quarter. As inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.\nWe face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug manufacturers.\nNew branded or generic products entering major markets affects our ability to maintain pricing and market share. Our products compete with other available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. A number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection or may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. We may be adversely impacted if any of these competitors gain market share as a result of new technologies, commercialization strategies or otherwise.\nOur existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and other discounts on our products and other pricing pressures.\nProduct Reimbursements\nSuccessful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. Government health authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. As our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices.\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently. For example, in September 2020, FDA issued a final rule implementing a pathway for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. This rule is subject to ongoing litigation. We may be adversely impacted by any such legislative and regulatory actions, though it is difficult to predict the impact, if any, on the use and reimbursement of our products.\nProduct Pricing, Discounts and Rebates\nIn the United States, the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. In the United States, the volume of drug pricing-related bills has dramatically increased in recent years. For example, Congress has enacted laws requiring manufacturer refunds on certain amounts of discarded drug from single-use vials beginning in 2023 and eliminating the existing cap on Medicaid rebate amounts beginning in 2024. Congress has also proposed bills to require the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for certain drugs, impose an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B and D drugs when list prices for drugs grow faster than inflation, and increase manufacturer contributions in some or all of the Medicare Part D benefit phases. In addition, many state legislatures are considering, or have already passed into law, legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as requiring manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, creating review boards for prices to state agencies, and encouraging the use of generic drugs. Such initiatives and legislation may cause added pricing pressures on our products, and the resulting impact on our business is uncertain. Many countries outside the United States, including the EU Member States, have established complex and lengthy procedures to obtain price approvals and coverage reimbursement and periodically review their pricing and reimbursement decisions. The outcome of this review cannot be predicted and could have an adverse effect on the pricing and reimbursement of our medicinal products in the EU member states. Reductions in the pricing of our medicinal products in one member state could affect the price in other member states and have a negative impact on our financial results.\nA substantial portion of our product sales is subject to significant discounts from list price, including rebates that we may be required to pay state Medicaid agencies and discounts provided to 340B covered entities. Changes to the 340B program or the Medicaid program at the federal or state level could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in December 2020, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) issued a final rule that will make certain changes to the calculation of rebates under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Among other changes, effective January 1, 2023, the final rule will change the requirements for excluding manufacturer co-pay coupons from the Medicaid \u201cbest price.\u201d These changes are subject to ongoing litigation. If these changes go into effect, they could substantially increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and decrease the prices we charge 340B covered entities. The continued growth of the 340B program also limits the prices we may charge on an increasing percentage of sales.\nIn addition, standard reimbursement structures may not adequately reimburse for innovative therapies. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2021, CMS established a new severity-adjusted diagnosis-related group (\u201cDRG\u201d) 018 for Medicare inpatient reimbursement of CAR T products such as Yescarta and Tecartus. While the new DRG has a significantly higher base payment amount than the prior DRG 016, the payment available may not be sufficient to reimburse some hospitals for their cost of care for patients receiving Yescarta and Tecartus. When reimbursement is not aligned well to account for treatment costs, Medicare beneficiaries may be denied access as this misalignment could impact the willingness of some hospitals to offer the therapy and of doctors to recommend the therapy. Additionally, in the EU, there are barriers to reimbursement in individual countries that could limit the uptake of Yescarta and Tecartus.\nIn addition, we estimate the rebates we will be required to pay in connection with sales during a particular quarter based on claims data from prior quarters. In the United States, actual rebate claims are typically made by payers one to three quarters in arrears. Actual claims and payments may vary significantly from our estimates.\nWe may experience adverse impacts resulting from the importation of our products from lower price markets or the distribution of illegally diverted or counterfeit versions of our products.\nPrices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported and resold into those countries from lower price markets. For example, U.S. sales could also be affected if FDA permits importation of drugs from Canada. We have entered into agreements with generic drug manufacturers as well as licensing agreements with the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed public health organization, which allows generic drug manufacturers to manufacture generic versions of certain of our products for distribution in certain low- and middle-income countries. We may be adversely affected if any generic versions of our products, whether or not produced and/or distributed under these agreements, are exported to the United States, Europe or markets with higher prices.\nIn the EU, we are required to permit products purchased in one EU member state to be sold in another member state. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high can affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter.\nAdditionally, diverted products may be used in countries where they have not been approved and patients may source the diverted products outside the legitimate supply chain. These diverted products may be handled, shipped and stored inappropriately, which may affect the efficacy of the products and could harm patients and adversely impact us.\nWe are also aware of the existence of various suppliers around the world that source our products and generic versions of our products without Gilead\u2019s authorization and sell them for use in countries where those products have not been approved. As a result, patients may be at risk of taking unapproved medications that may not be what they purport to be, may not have the potency they claim to have or may contain harmful substances, which could adversely impact us.\nFurther, third parties have illegally distributed and sold, and may continue to illegally distribute and sell, illegally diverted and counterfeit versions of our medicines, which do not meet the rigorous quality standards of our manufacturing and supply chain. For example, as part of an ongoing investigation in coordination with the U.S. Marshals and local law enforcement, we recently executed court-ordered seizures at 17 locations across eight U.S. states and seized thousands of bottles of Gilead-labeled medication with counterfeit supply chain documentation, including bottles labeled as Biktarvy and Descovy. Our investigation revealed that pharmaceutical distributors that are not authorized by Gilead to sell Gilead medicine, sold to independent pharmacies nationwide, purported genuine Gilead medicine sourced from an illegal counterfeiting scheme.\nIllegally diverted and counterfeit medicines pose a serious risk to patient health and safety. Our actions to stop or prevent the distribution and sale of illegally diverted and counterfeit versions of our medicines around the world may be costly and unsuccessful, which may adversely affect our reputation and business, including our product revenues and financial results.\nProduct Development and Supply Chain Risks\nWe face risks in our clinical trials, including the potential for unfavorable results, delays in anticipated timelines and disruption.\nWe are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidates that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products.\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties with our clinical trials that could result in delays or prevent completion of the development and approval of our product candidates. These risks and uncertainties include challenges in clinical trial protocol design, our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, and the possibility of unfavorable or inadequate trial results to support further development of our product candidates, including failure to meet a trial\u2019s primary endpoint, safety issues arising from our clinical trials, and the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials. For example, we recently announced clinical holds placed by FDA on clinical trials evaluating (1) injectable lenacapavir, (2) lenacapavir in combination with islatravir and (3) magrolimab, including in combination with azacitidine.\nAs a result, we may be unable to successfully complete our clinical trials on our anticipated timelines, or at all. Based on trial results, it is possible that FDA and other regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates, or that any market approvals may include significant limitations on the products\u2019 use. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could adversely impact our business. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. Therefore, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized, and we may be unable to recoup the significant R&D and clinical trial expenses incurred. In 2022, we anticipate the continued expansion of our clinical pipeline, which includes multiple planned Phase 3 study initiations in oncology and virology. We expect to expend significant time and resources on our clinical trial activities without any assurance that we will recoup our investments or that our efforts will be commercially successful.\nThere are also risks associated with the use of third parties in our clinical trial activities. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management, patient enrollment, ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs\u2019 processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals may be adversely affected.\nWe may face manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners.\nOur products, which are manufactured at our own facilities or by third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, are the result of complex, highly regulated manufacturing processes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are out of our control. We and our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are subject to Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by FDA and the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), as well as comparable regulations in other jurisdictions. Manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies.\nAny adverse developments affecting or resulting from our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products. We may also need to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. In addition, manufacturing issues may cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. For example, if we are unable to remedy any deficiencies cited by FDA or other regulatory agencies in their inspections, our existing products and the timing of regulatory approval of product candidates in development could be adversely affected. Further, there is risk that regulatory agencies in other countries where marketing applications are pending will undertake similar additional reviews or apply a heightened standard of review, which could delay the regulatory approvals for products in those countries. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\nWe may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.\nWe need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture and sell our products. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternative materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture and sell our products could be limited.\nSuppliers of key components and materials must be named in the new drug application or marketing authorization application filed with the regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular periodic inspections by regulatory authorities following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand. In addition, if deliveries of materials from our suppliers are interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our product candidates in development for clinical trials. Also, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are manufactured by only one supplier or at only one facility, which we may not be able to replace in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Problems with any of the single suppliers or facilities we depend on, including in the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.\nA significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our antiviral products are supplied by third-party manufacturers and corporate partners outside of the United States. As a result, any political or economic factors in a specific country or region, including any changes in or interpretations of trade regulations, compliance requirements or tax legislation, that would limit or prevent third parties outside of the United States from supplying these materials could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our antiviral products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to conduct clinical trials on product candidates and to manufacture and sell our products could be impaired.\nRegulatory and Other Legal Risks\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will file, for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all. Even if marketing approval is granted for these products, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances, we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities may result in regulatory approvals being delayed, denied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\nFailure to comply with these or other requirements imposed by FDA could result in significant civil monetary penalties, fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecutions.\nWe are impacted by evolving laws, regulations and legislative or regulatory actions applicable to the health care industry.\nThe health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to drug reimbursement, rebates, price reporting, health care fraud and abuse, and data privacy and security. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state programs, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, laws that regulate written and verbal communications about our products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information. Actual or alleged violations of these laws or any related regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense health programs, actions against executives overseeing our business and significant remediation measures, negative publicity or other consequences. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to changing and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material.\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we are continually assessing the methods by which we calculate and report pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subjective and may be subject to review and challenge by various government agencies, which may disagree with our interpretation. If the government disagrees with our reported calculations, we may need to restate previously reported data and could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\nThere also continues to be enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs, and manufacturer donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on reimbursement and other patient support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. If we, or our agents and vendors, are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar violations by our competitors could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\nFor a description of our government investigations and related litigation, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to risks if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates.\nAs additional studies are conducted subsequent to obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients, including patients with underlying health problems or patients taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or to halt sales of a product.\nRegulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through websites and other means, such as periodic safety update report summaries, risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and defend our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally, and to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to:\n\u2022obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;\n\u2022preserve trade secrets and internal know-how;\n\u2022defend against infringement of our patents and efforts to invalidate them; and\n\u2022operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others.\nBecause patent applications are confidential for a period of time before a patent is issued, we may not know if our competitors have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. If competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in litigation, post-grant proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other proceedings to determine the right to a patent or validity of any patent granted. Such litigation and proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, and could divert management attention from other operations, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, we may be adversely impacted.\nGeneric manufacturers have sought, and may continue to seek, FDA approval to market generic versions of our products through an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d), the application process typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. For a description of our ANDA litigation, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The entry of generic versions of our products has, and may in the future, lead to market share and price erosion.\nIf we are found to infringe the valid patents of third parties, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by third parties that such parties may claim cover the use of sofosbuvir, axicabtagene ciloleucel or bictegravir, as well as certain uses of combinations of emtricitabine (\u201cFTC\u201d) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (\u201cTDF\u201d) or TAF. For a description of our pending patent litigation, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFurthermore, we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. For example, a great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets, internal know-how or technological innovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&D agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partner and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions. We could be adversely affected if our trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovation or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitors or if we enter into disputes over ownership of inventions.\nWe face potentially significant liability and increased expenses from litigation and government investigations relating to our products and operations.\nWe are involved in a number of litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters that require us to expend substantial internal and financial resources. These matters could require us to pay significant monetary amounts, including royalty payments for past and future sales. For example, on February 1, 2022, we reached an agreement with ViiV Healthcare Company and related parties (collectively, \u201cViiV\u201d) for a global resolution of all pending or potential claims related to our sales of Biktarvy, pursuant to which (1) ViiV granted Gilead a broad worldwide license and covenant not to sue relating to any past, present or future development or commercialization of bictegravir, and (2) Gilead agreed to make a one-time payment of $1.25 billion and an ongoing royalty at a rate of 3% on future sales of Biktarvy and the bictegravir component of bictegravir-containing products in the United States until October 5, 2027.\nWe expect these matters will continue to require a high level of internal and financial resources for the foreseeable future. These matters have reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, our earnings and require significant management attention.\nIn addition, the testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. We have limited insurance for product liabilities that may arise and claims may exceed our coverage.\nFor a description of our litigation, investigation and other dispute-related matters, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The outcome of such legal proceedings or any other legal proceedings that may be brought against us, the investigations or any other investigations that may be initiated and any other dispute-related matters, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.\nOperational Risks\nOur business has been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.\nActual or threatened outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, may significantly disrupt our global operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets and has resulted in increased risks and adverse impacts to our operations, including as described below. In addition to the developments discussed in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we are monitoring a number of risks related to the pandemic, including the following:\n\u2022Supply Chain: The pandemic could result in disruptions to our global supply chain and distribution in the future. For example, quarantines, shelter-in-place and other governmental orders and policies, travel restrictions, airline capacity and route reductions, safety guidelines and health impacts of the pandemic could impact the availability or productivity of products and personnel at manufacturers, distributors, freight carriers and other necessary components of our supply chain. In addition, there may be unfavorable changes in the availability or cost of raw materials, intermediates and other materials necessary for production, which may result in higher costs, disruptions in our supply chain and interruptions in our distribution capabilities.\n\u2022Clinical Trials: The pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect certain of our clinical trials, including our ability to initiate and complete our clinical trials within the anticipated timelines. For ongoing trials, clinical trial sites have imposed restrictions on patient visits to limit risks of possible COVID-19 exposure, and we may experience issues with participant compliance with clinical trial protocols as a result of quarantines, travel restrictions and interruptions to healthcare services. There is also a risk that closures at clinical sites may be necessary as the pandemic and related guidance and restrictions continue to evolve. For the foregoing reasons, we have experienced delays with new subject enrollment for most clinical trials during the course of the pandemic, and may continue to experience overall delays in our clinical trials. There is also the risk of biased data collection if only certain clinical trial sites remain open. As a result of these challenges, our anticipated filing and marketing timelines for certain products may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022Regulatory Reviews: The operations of FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies may be adversely affected. We may also experience delays in necessary interactions with regulatory authorities around the world, including with respect to any anticipated filing, which, together with other factors resulting from the pandemic, may adversely impact our ability to launch new commercial products.\n\u2022Access to Healthcare Providers: The pandemic has limited patients\u2019 ability or willingness to access and seek care from healthcare providers and initiate or continue therapies, which has resulted in lower demand for our products during the course of the pandemic, particularly with respect to hepatitis C virus (\u201cHCV\u201d) treatment and HIV treatment and prevention. For example, we have observed lower levels of patient visits and testing volumes in HCV, resulting in fewer patient starts. In addition, at times during the pandemic, we have seen lower levels of screening and diagnosis for HIV, resulting in fewer treatment initiations, as well as higher levels of discontinuations, resulting in a reduction in prescription refills. With increased levels of unemployment at times during the pandemic, we have also experienced shifts in payer mix towards more government-funded coverage and the uninsured segment. Our field personnel have also had reduced access to healthcare personnel during the pandemic, including fewer in-person interactions, which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our commercial activities.\n\u2022Employees: We face risks related to the health, safety, morale and productivity of our employees, including the safe occupancy of our sites during the pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we transitioned to a return-to-site phase for our U.S. flexible location employees. Our job site enhancements and risk protocols, which include health screenings and COVID-19 testing and vaccine requirements, do not guarantee that we can maintain the continued safe occupancy of our sites and may adversely impact employee recruitment and retention. On-site employees testing positive for COVID-19 could lead to mandatory quarantines and potential site shutdowns.\n\u2022Financial: The pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse financial impact in the short term and potentially beyond. In particular, our HCV and HIV businesses have been and continue to be adversely impacted. For example, we have observed reductions in the overall U.S. HCV treatment, HIV treatment and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (\u201cPrEP\u201d) volumes at times during the pandemic, and it is uncertain when these volumes will all return to pre-pandemic levels. We may continue to experience fluctuating revenues as infection rates rise and fall and as pandemic restrictions are periodically tightened and eased. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in our short-term revenues due to fluctuations in inventory channel purchases during the pandemic. We could also have additional unexpected expenses related to the pandemic, which could negatively affect our results of operations. These factors together with the overall uncertainty and disruption caused by the pandemic could result in increased volatility and decreased predictability in our results of operations and volatility in our stock price.\nThe pandemic has also amplified many of the other risks described throughout the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business and results will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including any potential future waves of the pandemic, new variants of the virus that impact the severity and duration of the pandemic, the development, distribution, effectiveness and public acceptance of vaccines, and any other ongoing and future actions taken to contain the pandemic.\nWe face risks associated with our global operations.\nOur global operations are accompanied by certain financial, political, economic and other risks, including those listed below:\n\u2022Foreign Currency Exchange: For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 29% of our product sales were outside the United States. Because a significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies, and therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Our hedging program does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations. We may be adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation.\n\u2022Interest Rates and Inflation: We hold interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including our available-for-sale debt securities and our senior unsecured notes and credit facilities. Fluctuations in the interest rate could expose us to increased financial risk. In addition, changes in the inflation rate could also adversely impact our business and financial results.\n\u2022Anti-Bribery: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws that govern our international operations with respect to payments to government officials. Our international operations are heavily regulated and require significant interaction with foreign officials. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state-controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom. It is possible that certain of our practices may be challenged under these laws. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and agents. Enforcement activities under anti-bribery laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties and exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther risks inherent in conducting a global business include:\n\u2022Restrictive government actions against our intellectual property and other foreign assets such as nationalization, expropriation, the imposition of compulsory licenses or similar actions, including waiver of intellectual property protections.\n\u2022Protective economic policies taken by foreign governments, such as trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, which may result in the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the United States or other governments.\n\u2022Business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, extreme heat, drought or actual or threatened public health emergencies, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters, such as public safety power shutoffs and facility shutdowns, for which we may be uninsured or inadequately insured. For example, our corporate headquarters in Foster City and certain R&D and manufacturing facilities are located in California, a seismically active region. In the event of a major earthquake, we may not carry adequate earthquake insurance and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations.\n\u2022Political instability or disruption in a geographic region where we operate, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, social unrest and political changes.\nOur aspirations, goals and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters expose us to numerous risks, including risks to our reputation and stock price.\nInstitutional and individual investors are increasingly using ESG screening criteria to determine whether Gilead qualifies for inclusion in their investment portfolios. We are frequently asked by investors and other stakeholders to set ambitious ESG goals and provide new and more robust disclosure on goals, progress toward goals and other matters of interest to ESG stakeholders. In response, we have adapted the tracking and reporting of our corporate responsibility program to various evolving ESG frameworks, and we have established and announced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. These goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\nOur ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to environmental and diversity initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (3) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards, (4) our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, and (5) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations.\nThe standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals.\nIf our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nWe depend on relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance, technology, development, logistics and commercialization of products. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance by these companies or disputes with these third parties could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on a number of collaborative relationships with third parties for our sales and marketing performance in certain territories. For example, we have collaboration arrangements with Janssen Sciences Ireland UC for Odefsey, Complera/Eviplera and Symtuza. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of certain of our products. Some of these relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the risk that:\n\u2022we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;\n\u2022disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners;\n\u2022disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to perform;\n\u2022our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;\n\u2022our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our products than they do to products of their own development; and\n\u2022our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us.\nGiven these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.\nDue to the specialized and technical nature of our business, the failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely impact us.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. Our ability to do so also depends in part on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Additionally, changes to U.S. immigration and work authorization laws and regulations could make it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer to one of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nSignificant cybersecurity incidents could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including our Kite Konnect platform, which is critical to maintain chain of identity and chain of custody of Yescarta and Tecartus. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and ransomware attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others can result in the exposure of sensitive data, including our intellectual property or trade secrets or the personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cybersecurity incidents include, for example, the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business and technology partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture.\nLike many companies, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches and service interruptions. When cybersecurity incidents occur, we respond and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and other legal requirements, including our cybersecurity protocols. There can be no assurance that our efforts in response to cybersecurity incidents, as well as our investments to protect our information technology infrastructure and data, will shield us from significant losses and potential liability or prevent any future interruption or breach of our systems. Such cybersecurity incidents can cause the loss of critical or sensitive information, including personal information, and could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws.\nRegulators globally are also imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including new and greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) established regulations regarding the handling of personal data, and non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenue. In addition, new domestic data privacy and security laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act and other laws that have been or may be passed, similarly introduce requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with such laws may result in liability through private actions (subject to statutorily defined damages in the event of certain data breaches) and enforcement. Other changes or new laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal information, including, in some cases, healthcare data or other personal information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nStrategic and Financial Risks\nWe are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If we are successful in making an acquisition or closing a licensing arrangement or collaboration, the products, intellectual property and technologies that are acquired or licensed may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter, and earlier if impairment indicators exist, as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we may need to recognize impairment charges if the products, intellectual property and technologies that are acquired or licensed are not successful. For option structured deals, there is no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\nWe have paid substantial amounts of cash and incurred additional debt to finance our strategic transactions. Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the cash used and the debt issued in connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics, Inc. in 2020, S&P Global Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or timing of such changes. Our effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.", "PERMNO": 77274, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GILD"}
