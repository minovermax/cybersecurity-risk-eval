On March 21, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the lenders agreed to extend the maturity date from April 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019. Without additional sources of capital or a significant restructuring of our balance sheet, the maturity of our Credit Agreement raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which means that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph with respect to this uncertainty in its report that is included with our financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. Such explanatory paragraph may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and may otherwise limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities or otherwise. Further, the perception that we may be unable to continue as a going concern may impede our ability to raise additional funds or operate our business due to concerns with respect to our ability to discharge our contractual obligations.\nWe have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Without additional capital or a significant restructuring of our balance sheet, however, we may be unable to continue as a viable entity, in which case our stockholders may lose all or some of their investment in us.\nWe have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, evaluating financial, transactional and other strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure that may be time consuming, disruptive and costly to our business.\nAs a result of extremely challenging current market conditions and our upcoming debt maturities, on March 13, 2019, we announced that we engaged financial and legal advisors to assist in evaluating financial, transactional and other strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel. We may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and preparing for any such strategic alternatives. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory limitations and the interest of third parties in us and our assets. There can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity can be raised from any one or more of these transactions or that these transactions can be consummated within the period needed to meet our obligations or at all.\nWe may need to seek relief under the U. S. Bankruptcy Code, even if we are successful in effecting a financial, transactional or other strategic alternative. Any bankruptcy proceeding may result in holders of our equity securities and our other stakeholders receiving little or no consideration.\nIt may be necessary for us to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Such a proceeding could be commenced in the near term and requires our conducting of preparatory work. If a plan of reorganization is implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is possible that holders of claims and interests with respect to, or rights to acquire, our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests may be canceled for little or no consideration. If that were to occur, we anticipate that all or substantially all of the value of all investments in our equity securities would be lost and that our equity holders would lose all or substantially all of their investment. It is also possible that our other stakeholders, including our secured and unsecured creditors, will receive substantially less than the amount of their claims.\nIf we are unable to refinance or repay our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement when it comes due or otherwise fail to comply with certain restrictions and financial covenants in our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement, we could be in default under our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement which may result in acceleration or repayment of all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe could default on the payment of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement when it comes due which may result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement or foreclosure on our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement restrict, among other things, our ability to incur debt and requires us\nto comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. We may not be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under our Credit Agreement or our Term Loan Credit Agreement could result in a default under our Credit Agreement or our Term Loan Credit Agreement. On March 21, 2019, we received a waiver of certain covenants under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. The waiver received under our Term Loan Credit Agreement is temporary such that we will be in default for the failure to have delivered audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or exception as of May 31, 2019, the same day as the scheduled maturity of our Credit Agreement. Further, upon delivery of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, we expect to be in violation of the current ratio covenant under our Credit Agreement, which would constitute a default under the Credit Agreement. Although we have received waivers from our lenders under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement in the past, there can be no assurances that we will receive any waivers in the future. If the lenders under our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement were to accelerate the indebtedness under our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement as a result of any such default, such acceleration could cause a cross-default of all of our other outstanding indebtedness and permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturities of such indebtedness.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and the potential for strategic alternatives or restructuring transactions may impact our business, financial condition and operations.\nDue to our substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and the potential for strategic alternatives or restructuring transactions, there is risk that, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties\u2019 confidence in our ability to develop oil and natural gas properties could erode, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nit may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees;\n\u2022\nemployees could be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities;\n\u2022\nwe could lose some or a significant portion of our liquidity, either due to stricter credit terms from vendors, or, in the event we undertake a Chapter 11 proceeding and conclude that we need to procure debtor-in-possession financing, an inability to obtain any needed debtor-in-possession financing or to provide adequate protection to certain secured lenders to permit us to access some or all of our cash; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers, vendors and service providers could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events may increase our operating costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf oil and natural gas prices decline, our cash flow from operations will decline.\nLower oil and natural gas prices will decrease our revenues and thus cash flow from operations. Prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nmarket expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in other oil and natural gas producing countries, including embargoes and continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other petroleum producing countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\ntrading in oil and natural gas derivative contracts;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy production and consumption;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nHistorically, oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile. For example, for the five years ended December 31, 2018, the NYMEX-WTI oil price ranged from a high of $107.95 per Bbl to a low of $26.19 per Bbl, while the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu. As of February 28, 2019, the NYMEX WTI oil spot price was $57.21 per Bbl and the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas spot price was $2.89 per MMBtu. If oil and natural gas prices decline from current levels, it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nFailure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe growth of our business depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Historically, we have also acquired additional oil and natural gas reserves through acreage trades with other producers and we may not be able to identify or execute attractive acreage trades in the future. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties, including through acreage trades, containing proved reserves, or both. Further, the rate of estimated decline of our oil and natural gas reserves may increase if our wells do not produce as expected. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If oil and natural gas prices increase, our costs for additional reserves would also increase; conversely if natural gas or oil prices decrease, it could make it more difficult to fund the replacement of our reserves.\nOur debt levels may limit our flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total debt of approximately $1.3 billion. Our existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\ncovenants in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nour access to the capital markets may be limited;\n\u2022\nwe will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour debt level will make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results and cash flows are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as further reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur development projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nOur development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and, subject to availability, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\ncapital and lending market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold; and\n\u2022\nour ability to identify, acquire and exploit new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement decrease as a result of lower oil and/or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. Our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement restrict our ability to obtain new financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing due to such restrictions, market conditions or otherwise. If cash generated by operations or available under our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas production and reserves, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil and natural gas can be uneconomic, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable.\nIn addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe high cost, shortages or delivery delays of equipment, materials, and services;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions or events;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\ntitle disputes;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes and approvals;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\ncollapses of wellbore, casing or other tubulars;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nblowouts, craterings and explosions;\n\u2022\ninterference from new well stimulation;\n\u2022\noffset operations causing irregularities or interruptions in production; and\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids.\nFurthermore, our drilling and producing operations produce significant amounts of water and inadequate access to or availability of water disposal infrastructure could adversely affect our production volumes or significantly increase the costs of our operations.\nAny of these events can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, loss of wells and regulatory penalties.\nWe ordinarily maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations; however, insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could therefore occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf commodity prices decline, a significant portion of our development projects may become uneconomic and cause write downs of the value of our oil and natural gas properties, which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also may render many of our development and production projects uneconomic and result in a downward adjustment of our reserve estimates, which would negatively impact our borrowing base under our Credit Agreement and ability to fund operations.\nA reduction in commodity prices may be caused by many factors, including substantial increases in U.S. production and reserves from unconventional (shale) reservoirs, without a corresponding increase in demand. The International Energy Agency forecasts continued U.S. oil production growth in 2019. This environment could cause the prices for oil to fall to lower levels.\nFurthermore, a decrease in oil and natural gas prices may render a significant portion of our development projects uneconomic. In addition, if oil and natural gas prices decline, our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate, accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for impairments. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred impairment charges of $68.0 million, a portion of which was driven by commodity price changes. We may incur further impairment charges in the future related to depressed commodity prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.\nIncreases in the cost for drilling rigs, service rigs, pumping services and other costs in drilling and completing wells could reduce the viability of certain of our development projects.\nIncreased capital requirements for our projects will result in higher reserve replacement costs and could cause certain of our projects to become uneconomic even with increased commodity prices and therefore not to be implemented, reducing our production and cash flow. Decreased availability of drilling equipment and services could significantly impact the planned execution of our development program.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs and drilling results. Our final determination on whether to drill any of these drilling locations will be dependent upon the factors described above as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities with respect to our proved drilling locations. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected time frame or will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may be materially different from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in price and demand for our production may force us to shut in a significant number of our producing wells, which may adversely impact our revenues.\nWe are subject to great fluctuations in the prices we are paid for our production due to a number of factors. Drilling in shale resources has developed large amounts of new oil and natural gas supplies, both from natural gas wells and associated natural gas from oil wells, that have depressed the prices paid for our production, and we expect the shale resources to continue to be drilled and developed by our competitors. We also face the potential risk of shut-in production due to high levels of oil, natural gas and NGL inventory in storage, weak demand due to mild weather and the effects of any economic downturns on industrial demand. Lack of NGL storage in Mont Belvieu, where our West Texas and New Mexico NGLs are shipped for processing, could cause the processors of our natural gas to curtail or shut-in our natural gas wells and potentially force us to shut-in oil wells that produce associated natural gas, which may adversely impact our revenues. For example, following past hurricanes, certain Permian Basin natural gas processors were forced to shut down their plants due to the shutdown of the Texas Gulf Coast NGL fractionators, requiring us to vent or flare the associated natural gas from our oil wells. There is no certainty we will be able to vent or flare natural gas again due to potential changes in regulations. Furthermore, we may encounter problems in restarting production of previously shut-in wells.\nAn increase in the differential between the West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) or other benchmark prices of oil and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil production sometimes reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as WTI, that are used for calculating derivative positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. Increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. While this differential remained largely unchanged from 2015 through the first quarter of 2018, crude oil and associated natural gas production growth has strained existing takeaway capacity and caused widening basis differentials in the Permian Basin, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nDue to regional fluctuations in the actual prices received for our natural gas production, the derivative contracts we enter into may not provide us with sufficient protection against price volatility since they are based on indexes related to different and remote regional markets.\nWe sell our natural gas into local markets, the majority of which is produced in East Texas, Colorado, West Texas, Southeast New Mexico, Central Oklahoma and Wyoming and shipped to the Midwest, West Coast and Texas Gulf Coast. These regions account for over 90% of our natural gas sales. In the past, we have used swaps on Northwest Pipeline, California SoCal NGI and San Juan Basin natural gas prices and we may do so again in the future. While we are paid a local price indexed to or closely related to these indexes, these indexes are heavily influenced by prices received in remote regional consumer markets less transportation costs and thus may not be effective in protecting us against local price volatility.\nDecreases of our borrowing base under our Credit Agreement by our lenders, and any potential disruptions of the financial markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement for future capital needs. Our Credit Agreement, which matures on May 31, 2019, limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion. As of March 13, 2019, our borrowing base was $575.0 million and we had approximately $2.9 million available for borrowing. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, our borrowing base reduces to $570.0 million on May 22, 2019. Our Term Loan Credit Agreement for second lien term loans maturing on August 31, 2020 provides for up to an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, of which we have drawn $338.6 million.\nOur Credit Agreement provides for the mandatory termination of our derivative contracts three days prior to the maturity date of our Credit Agreement. Such terminations would result in a reduction of the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement.\nOutstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid within four months, and, if mortgaged properties represent less than 95% of total value of oil and natural gas properties used to determine the borrowing base, we must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under our Credit Agreement.\nAny decrease of our borrowing base could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financing Activities.\u201d\nAny acquisitions we complete are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not achieve the expected results of any acquisition we complete, and any adverse conditions or developments related to any such acquisition may have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.\nFurther, even if we complete any acquisitions, which we would expect to increase our cash flow, actual results may differ from our expectations and the impact of these acquisitions may actually result in a decrease in cash flow. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe validity of our assumptions about recoverable reserves, development potential, future production, revenues, capital expenditures, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate the assets and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\na decrease in our liquidity by using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\na lack of capital could cause the development of any acquisitions to be slower than forecasted;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key purchasers.\nOur decision to acquire a property depends in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses, seismic data and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Our estimates of future reserves and estimates of future development and production for our acquisitions and related forecasts of anticipated cash flow therefrom are initially based on detailed information furnished by the sellers and are subject to review, analysis and adjustment by our internal staff, typically without consulting with outside petroleum engineers. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain and our proved reserves estimates and cash flow forecasts therefrom may exceed actual acquired proved reserves or the estimates of future cash flows therefrom. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties included in our acquisitions that we believe is generally consistent with industry practices. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems.\nAlso, our reviews of newly acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it is generally not feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an\ninspection is undertaken. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities including the Bureau of Land Management. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations and could experience substantial disruptions to our operations if we do not timely receive permits required to drill new wells, especially on federal lands. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. All such costs or disruptions may have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, and the production of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and operational safety matters.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and safety requirements applicable to oil and natural gas exploration, production and restoration activities. These costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including regulations and enforcement policies, which have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and to a lesser extent, issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. In addition, third parties, including neighboring landowners, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance or to recover for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by environmental and other impacts of our operations.\nStrict, joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. If we were not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional wells in shale formations, as well as tight conventional formations including many of those that Legacy completes and produces. This process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production. Some states have adopted and others are considering legislation to restrict or additionally regulate hydraulic fracturing. For example, several states including Texas, Colorado and Wyoming have adopted or are considering legislation requiring the disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Sponsors of these bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. Public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. In addition, state and federal agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address seismic activity. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas has adopted regulations which place additional restrictions on the permitting of disposal well operations in areas of historical or future seismic activity. Any additional level of regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nFinal rules regulating air emissions from natural gas production operations could cause us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may be significant.\nOn April 17, 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") approved final regulations under the Clean Air Act that, among other things, require additional emissions controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations require the reduction of VOC emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or \u201cgreen completions\u201d on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. For well completion operations occurring at such well sites before January 1, 2015, the final regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to completion combustion devices, such as flares, in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA issued rules covering methane emissions from new oil and natural gas industry operations. Compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production, which costs may be significant.\nRestrictive covenants under the indentures governing our 2020 Senior Notes, 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Convertible Notes may adversely affect our operations.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes contains, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets, including equity interests in our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\npay distributions on, redeem or purchase our equity or redeem or purchase our subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the Senior Notes, our Credit Agreement, our Term Loan Credit Agreement, or any future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if the lenders under our Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement were to accelerate the indebtedness as a result of a default under the Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement, such acceleration could cause a cross-default of all our other outstanding indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, and permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturities of such indebtedness. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNo one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Any material\ninaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves may not be the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the trailing 12-month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. To illustrate the price impact of commodity prices on our proved reserves subsequent to December 31, 2018, we recalculated the value of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 using the five-year average forward price as of February 25, 2019 for both WTI oil and NYMEX natural gas. While this 5-year NYMEX forward strip price is not necessarily indicative of our overall outlook on future commodity prices, this commonly used methodology may help provide investors with an understanding of the impact of a volatile commodity price environment. Under such assumptions, we estimate the cumulative projected production from our year-end proved reserves would decrease by approximately 8.0% to 151.7 MMBoe from our previously reported 164.9 MMBoe, which is calculated as required by the SEC. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification 932 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by third parties. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, oversupply of oil due to nearby refinery outages, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not control all of our operations and development projects and failure of an operator of wells in which we own partial interests to adequately perform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our business activities are conducted through joint operating agreements under which we own partial interests in oil and natural gas wells.\nIf we do not operate wells in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of underlying properties. The success and timing of our development projects on properties operated by others is outside of our control.\nThe failure of an operator of wells in which we own partial interests to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements, could reduce our production and revenues and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows from operations and financial condition.\nSince all of the indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Agreement is at variable interest rates, we have significant exposure to increases in interest rates. As a result, our business, results of operations, cash flows from operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil and natural gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry who are also subject to the effects of the current oil and natural gas commodity price environment. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry and other conditions. In addition, our oil, natural gas and interest rate derivative transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties.\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace.\nOur operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our executive officers, senior management and key employees. The loss of any executive officer, member of our senior management or other key employees could negatively impact our ability to execute our strategy.\nOur business may be affected by shortages of skilled employees and labor cost inflation.\nCompetition for skilled employees in the oil and gas industry in Midland, Texas is strong, and labor costs have increased moderately since 2015. We expect that the demand and, hence, costs for skilled employees will increase as prices for oil and natural gas rise. Continual high demand for skilled employees and continued increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us. Our ability to acquire additional properties, including acreage trades, and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration and development activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Our inability to compete effectively with these companies could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to continue to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet certain reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nA failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities or those of third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition,\ndependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nOur operations are also subject to the risk of cyber security attacks. Any cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers or our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber security attacks on our customer and employee data may result in financial loss or potential liability and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer system failures, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales of oil, natural gas, NGLs and other energy commodities, and related hedging activities, expose us to potential regulatory risks.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical, swaps and futures energy commodities markets. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales of oil, natural gas, NGLs or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Our sales and trading may also be subject to certain reporting and other requirements. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe swaps-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) and the rules the CFTC has adopted regulate the markets in certain derivative transactions, broadly referred to as \u201cswaps\u201d and which include hedging and non-hedging oil and gas and interest rate transactions, and market participants. Swaps falling within classes designated or to be designated by the CFTC are or will be subject to clearing on a derivatives clearing organization, and, if accepted for clearing, are subject to execution on an exchange or a swap execution facility if made available for trading on such facility. To date, the CFTC has designated only certain classes of interest rate and index credit default swaps for mandatory clearing. The Act provides an exception from application of the Act's clearing and trade execution requirements that qualifying commercial end-users may elect for swaps they use to hedge or mitigate commercial risks (\"End-User Exception\"). Although we believe we will be able to qualify for, and have elected, the End-User Exception with respect to most, if not all, of the swaps we enter that otherwise would have to be cleared, if we cannot do so with respect to many of the swaps we enter into, our ability to execute our hedging program efficiently will be adversely affected. In addition, the CFTC and federal banking regulators have adopted rules (which are being phased in) requiring certain regulated persons to collect margin as to any uncleared swap from their counterparty to such swap if that counterparty is not a non-financial end user (as defined in such rules) Although we believe we qualify as a non-financial end user under such rules, if we do not do so and must provide margin regarding uncleared swaps to which we are a party, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\"EMIR\") includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives subject to EMIR. We have counterparties that are located in a jurisdiction subject to EMIR. Such counterparties are required to comply with EMIR and accordingly will require us to transact with them in a manner that will ensure their compliance with EMIR. In broad terms, EMIR's effect on the derivatives markets and their participants creates similar risks and could have similar adverse impacts as those under the swap regulatory provisions of the Act and the CFTC's swap rules. Finally, the Act included provisions, including related to position limits and reporting, that reflect that volatility in oil and natural gas prices is attributed by some legislators and regulators to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. The CFTC and Congress periodically focus on such concerns, particularly at times of price rises in the market. Our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of that focus is legislative or regulatory actions that lead to lower commodity prices.\nCurrent and proposed derivatives legislation and rulemaking as well as restrictions on hedging activities in our Credit Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we or our derivatives counterparties are subject to additional requirements imposed as a result of the Act or any new (or newly implemented) regulations or international legislation, such changes may increase our transaction costs or make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms. Any such regulations could also subject our hedge counterparties to limits on commodity positions and thereby have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity. Further, our revolving credit agreement restricts the types of counterparties that we can enter into hedging transactions with and the security that we are able to provide counterparties that are not lenders under our revolving credit facility. Our inability to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase our operating expenses and put us at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred net losses since our Corporate Reorganization and may continue to incur net losses in the future. Generally, losses incurred will carry forward until such losses are used to offset future taxable income, if any. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). If we were to experience an ownership change, we could potentially have, in the future, higher U.S. federal income tax liabilities than we would otherwise have had and it may also result in certain other adverse consequences to us. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of state tax attributes.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock\nWe may pursue financial, transactional and other strategic alternatives which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock through dilution or loss in value.\nAny financial, transactional or other strategic alternative may include the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities in exchange for outstanding indebtedness. Any debt securities or preferred stock that might be issued could have liquidation rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity and other securities could also be dilutive to existing stockholders and we cannot predict the extent of this dilution. Additionally, any restructuring could result in the holders of our common stock retaining only a limited portion of the equity of the company or even receiving no value for their holdings.\nThe price of our common stock may experience volatility.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community, sales of our common stock by significant stockholders, short-selling of our common stock by investors, issuance of a significant number of shares for equity-based compensation or to raise additional capital to fund our operations, changes in market valuations of similar companies and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations, as well as any doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. General market conditions and U.S. or international economic factors and political events unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nNASDAQ has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The standards for continued listing include, among other things, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below $1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days. Although we are currently in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, as of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, our minimum bid price was below $1.00 since March 14, 2019. If we do not satisfy any of the NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards, our common stock could be delisted. Any such delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease. A delisting could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations or result in a loss of confidence by investors, customers, suppliers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares of common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you.\nThere are provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares of common stock at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nIn addition, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws, including limitations on stockholder actions by written consent and on stockholder proposals and director nominations at meetings of stockholders, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Certain provisions of the DGCL may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our Credit Agreement and term loan credit agreement may prohibit us from paying any dividends without the consent of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and term loan credit agreement, other than dividends payable solely in equity interests of Legacy Inc.\nThe value of your shares may be diluted by future equity issuances, and shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price.\nWe cannot predict the effect of future sales of shares or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of or the liquidity of the market for the shares. Sales of substantial amounts of shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the shares. Such sales, or the possibility of such sales, could also make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 945,000,000 shares of common stock and 105,000,000 shares of preferred stock, a significant portion of which is unissued. We may need to raise a significant amount of capital to pay down outstanding indebtedness, including principal, interest and fees due under our Credit Agreement, term loan credit agreement and senior notes, to fund our drilling program and may raise such capital through the issuance of newly issued common stock or preferred stock. Such issuance and sale of equity could be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.\nAdditionally, the conversion of some or all of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the shares.", "PERMNO": 91739, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LGCYQ"}
