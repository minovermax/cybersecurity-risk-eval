Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below, those set forth in our \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d disclosure in Item 7, and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results.\nSeveral of the market segments that the Company serves are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and global economic conditions.\nSeveral of the market segments in which the Company sells its products are, to varying degrees, cyclical, and may experience periodic downturns in demand. For example, the Brake & Friction segment is susceptible to downturns in the construction, agriculture, and mining industries, the Interconnect Technologies segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial airline industry, and the Construction Materials segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry. In addition, both the Interconnect Technologies segment and the Brake & Friction segment may be negatively impacted by reductions in military spending.\nCurrent uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations, and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, difficulties entering new markets, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates, and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s customers, distributors, and suppliers, and therefore, the Company\u2019s results of operations, margins, and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when, or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company\u2019s control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s growth is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.\nThe Company has a long standing acquisition program and expects to continue acquiring businesses. Typically, the Company considers acquiring small companies in similar industries. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include potential difficulties integrating the business into existing operations; a failure to realize expected growth, synergies, and efficiencies; increasing dependency on the markets served by certain businesses, increased debt to finance the acquisitions or the inability to obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms.\nThe Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing operations and could increase the possibility of diverting management\u2019s attention from its existing operations. See \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for acquisition information.\nThe successful integration of our acquired businesses is dependent upon the realization of efficiencies and synergies. If these integration initiatives do not occur, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully integrate any acquired business or realize the growth, synergies, and efficiencies that were expected when determining the purchase price, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired may be considered impaired, resulting in an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. See \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for a discussion of factors considered in the subsequent valuation of the Company\u2019s acquired goodwill and intangible assets.\nThe Company has significant concentrations in the commercial construction market.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 56% of the Company\u2019s revenues, and approximately 85% of its EBIT (excluding Corporate expenses and including impairment charges of $141.5 million) were generated by the Construction Materials segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state, and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials. Weather conditions can also be a positive factor, as demand for roofing materials may rise after harsh weather conditions due to the need for replacement materials.\nThe Construction Materials segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Increased competition in this segment has, and could, continue to place negative pressure on operating results in future periods.\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal, and business factors.\nThe Company has increased, and anticipates that it will continue to increase, its presence in global markets. Approximately 23% of the Company\u2019s revenues in 2016 were generated outside the United States. The Company expects this percentage will grow as the Company continues to expand its international sales efforts. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company\u2019s segments have operations outside the United States.\nThe Company\u2019s increasing reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror, and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion, or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.\nThe loss of, or a significant decline in business with, one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company operates in several specialty niche markets in which a large portion of the segment\u2019s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Overview-Description of Businesses by Segment\u201d for a discussion of customer concentrations by segment. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of one or more of the Company\u2019s segments.\nSome of the Company\u2019s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company\u2019s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in-source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides.\nRaw Material costs are a significant component of the Company\u2019s cost structure and are subject to volatility.\nThe Company utilizes petroleum-based products, steel, and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 59% of the Company\u2019s cost of goods sold in 2016. Significant increases in the price of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements and global economic conditions.\nIf the Company or its business partners are unable to adequately protect the Company\u2019s information assets from cyber-based attacks or other security incidents, the Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on information technology, including the internet, for the storage, processing, and transmission of its electronic, business-related, information assets. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain, and protect its global business interests. In the event that the Company or its business partners are unable to prevent, detect, and remediate cyber-based attacks or other security incidents in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted or the Company may incur financial or reputational losses arising from the theft, alteration, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or destruction of its information assets.\nCurrency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s reported results of business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s global net sales and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. Dollars. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. Dollar will decrease the Company\u2019s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. Dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas. Many of the Company\u2019s sales that are exported by its U.S. subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in U.S. Dollars, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the U.S. Dollar may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 products that are sold in U.S. Dollars within foreign locations.\nThe Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See \u201cPart II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19 - Foreign Currency Forward Contracts\u201d for a discussion of these contracts.\nDispositions, failure to successfully complete dispositions, or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company.\nFrom time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from the Company\u2019s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses, and a potential dilutive effect on the Company\u2019s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows and/or the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy.\nAdditionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management attention from the Company\u2019s core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis, and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a timely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies, and efficiencies are not realized there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDuring 2016, the Company implemented cost reduction plans and incurred restructuring and severance charges of $15.5 million, primarily resulting from a reduction in workforce, facility consolidation and relocation, and lease termination costs associated with our Interconnect Technologies segment, Fluid Technologies segment and Corporate office. See \u201cPart II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4 - Restructuring\u201d for a discussion of these restructuring programs.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to regulatory risks.\nCertain products manufactured by our businesses operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals as well as maintain certifications to supply our products to OEM aerospace customers and to obtain regulatory approvals to market medical devices. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre-market authorization and post-market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device interconnect components. Failure to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 27334, "SIC": 2950, "TIC": "CSL"}
