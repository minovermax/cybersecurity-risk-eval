{"cik": "1557746", "company": "Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. If any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses. We incurred net losses of $132.7 million and $68.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $292.2 million. We have financed our operations since inception primarily from sales of our convertible preferred stock and, beginning with our initial public offering in October 2015, from public offerings and a private placement of our common stock. We currently have two products, ESKATA and RHOFADE, that generate revenue from product sales.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to the development of our drug candidates, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, and beginning in 2017, to the commercialization of our products. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years as we:\n\u00b7\ncontinue to commercialize ESKATA and RHOFADE in the United States;\n\u00b7\ncontinue our ongoing clinical trials evaluating A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts and pursue marketing approvals for A-101 45% Topical Solution and for any other drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ninitiate and continue clinical trials of our other drug candidates, including ATI-501 for the treatment of AA and ATI-502 for the treatment of AA, vitiligo, AGA and atopic dermatitis;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop our preclinical drug candidates, including ATI-450, an MK-2 inhibitor, ATI-1777, a soft-JAK inhibitor, and our ITK inhibitors;\n\u00b7\nseek to discover and develop additional drug candidates;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize our products and any drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nseek to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions;\n\u00b7\nadapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed drugs;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nhire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;\n\u00b7\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development and commercialization efforts; and\n\u00b7\nincur additional legal, accounting, investor relations and other administrative expenses in operating as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in commercializing our products and developing and eventually commercializing drug candidates that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates, obtaining marketing approval, and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products and drug candidates for which we have obtained and may obtain marketing approval, as well as discovering and developing additional drug candidates. We are only in the early stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nFor ESKATA, RHOFADE and for any drug candidates for which we are successful in obtaining marketing approval, our revenue is and will continue to be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain marketing approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement, if any, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such drug products, even if approved.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our drug candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain marketing approvals for our drugs, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.\nIdentifying potential drug candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years as we continue to commercialize ESKATA and RHOFADE and conduct clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for our drug candidates. In addition, ESKATA and RHOFADE, and our drug candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts or any other drug candidates that we develop, we expect to incur additional significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We also expect an increase in our expenses associated with creating additional infrastructure to support our continuing operations as a public company.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $168.0 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the date of this Annual Report will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than 12 months from the date of this report based on our current operating assumptions. These assumptions may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Changes may occur beyond our control that would cause us to consume our available capital before that time, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional products or drug candidates, and changes in regulation. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe number and development requirements of the drug candidates that we may pursue;\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of commercializing ESKATA and RHOFADE and the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including drug manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our drug candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe revenue received from commercial sales of ESKATA and RHOFADE and any of our drug candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe progress of obtaining marketing approval for ESKATA in select countries in the European Union and Norway;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish collaborations to commercialize ESKATA and RHOFADE outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future products or drug candidates, if any, as a result of licenses to, or partnership or collaborations with, third parties.\nWe expect that we will require additional capital to complete the clinical trials for and potentially commercialize A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, to complete the clinical development of ATI-501 and ATI-502, to develop our preclinical compounds, to support our discovery efforts, and to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other drug candidates. We also expect to incur significant expenses related to the commercialization of ESKATA and RHOFADE, including product manufacturing, sales, marketing, advertising and distribution costs. In addition, in 2019 we plan to invest in a new research facility for our drug discovery operations. Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford.\nIn October 2018, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan and Security Agreement, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, pursuant to which we borrowed $30.0 million on October 31, 2018, and can draw an additional $35.0 million until March 31, 2019. Our obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets except for our intellectual property, and we may not encumber our intellectual property without Oxford's prior written consent. The Loan and Security Agreement contains negative covenants restricting our activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions, incurring indebtedness or liens, paying dividends or making investments and other specified business transactions. The Loan and Security Agreement also contains specified financial covenants related to us achieving specified minimum consolidated revenues in future periods. Our obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition. We may also enter into other debt agreements in the future which may contain similar or more restrictive terms.\nOur ability to make scheduled monthly payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of\ncash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Failure to comply with the covenants and conditions of the Loan and Security Agreement, including our failure to achieve the minimum revenue covenants, could result in an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of amounts due under the Loan and Security Agreement. We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments, and Oxford could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, which would harm our business.\nBecause our long-term indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases.\nOur long-term indebtedness bears interest at a fluctuating interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, products or drug candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and collaboration agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, products or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements with third parties when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to third parties to develop and market technologies, products or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe have a limited operating history and a limited history of commercializing drugs, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe commenced operations in 2012, and our operations to date have been largely focused on raising capital, developing ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, including undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials, and acquiring new drug candidates and related intellectual property. We launched ESKATA in the United States in May 2018 and acquired RHOFADE in November 2018. We have had limited time to demonstrate our ability to successfully manufacture a drug on a commercial scale, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization of these products. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or\na longer history of commercializing drugs. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives.\nOur estimates of variable consideration related to revenue recognition from product sales are difficult to estimate, and if our estimates differ significantly from actual product sales, we will be required to record an adjustment in a subsequent period.\nOur estimates of variable consideration related to revenue recognition from product sales are difficult to estimate as they are based on multiple assumptions which may prove to be incorrect. For example, we pay certain third-party payors rebates with respect to the utilization of RHOFADE which are based on contractual percentages applied to the amount of RHOFADE prescribed to patients who are covered by the plan or the organization with which the third-party payor contracts. We have a savings card program to provide assistance to eligible patients with out-of-pocket costs for the patient\u2019s usage of RHOFADE. Reductions to product sales for the savings card program are estimated based on actual and expected program utilization. We recognize revenue from product sales at the point the customer obtains control, which generally occurs upon delivery, and also include estimates of variable consideration in the same period revenue is recognized. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, government rebates, discounts and rebates, other incentives such as patient co-pay assistance, and other fee for service amounts. Our estimates of variable consideration are based on assumptions relating to, among other things, the mix of patients who purchase RHOFADE who are fully insured, underinsured and uninsured and the utilization of our savings card program, rebates, discounts and other pricing concessions and fees. If our estimates of variable consideration differ significantly from actual product sales, we will be required to record an adjustment in a subsequent period to reported product sales and earnings.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development or commercialization of our drug candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Drug Candidates\nIf we are unable to successfully develop, receive marketing approval for and commercialize our drug candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.\nWe have invested significant efforts and financial resources in the development of our drug candidates and the identification of potential drug candidates. Our ability to generate substantial revenue from our drug candidates will depend heavily on the successful development, marketing approval and eventual commercialization of these drug candidates. The success of any drug candidates that we develop, including A-101 45% Topical Solution, ATI-501 and ATI-502, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful development of our manufacturing processes for any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of timely approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ncommercial launch of our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of our drug candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, and willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for our drug candidates when third-party payor coverage and reimbursement is limited or unavailable;\n\u00b7\nour success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative treatments for the proposed indications of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;\n\u00b7\ncompeting effectively with other treatment procedures; and\n\u00b7\nmaintaining a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our drugs following approval.\nWhether marketing approval will be granted is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Our drug candidates\u2019 success in clinical trials will not guarantee marketing approval. If, following submission, our NDA for any drug candidate is not accepted for substantive review, or even if it is accepted for substantive review, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we conduct additional studies or clinical trials, provide additional data, take additional manufacturing steps, or require other conditions before they will reconsider or approve our application. If the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities require additional studies, clinical trials or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not consider sufficient any additional required studies, clinical trials, data or information that we perform and complete or generate, or we may decide to abandon the program.\nIt is possible that our drug candidates currently in development will never obtain marketing approval, even if we expend substantial time and resources seeking such approval. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, which would harm our business.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nThe risk of failure for our drug candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our drug candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in humans for use in the target indication. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome.\nA failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drugs.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our drug candidates, including:\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites or prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials of our drug candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon drug development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nour drug candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u00b7\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of clinical trials of our drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u00b7\nthe supply or quality of our drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the institutional review boards of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these drug candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our drug candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our drug candidates. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our drug candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our drug candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7\nobtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7\nobtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nhave the drug removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur drug development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our drug candidates or allow our competitors to bring drugs to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of subjects. Subject enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of subject enrollment taking longer than anticipated or subject withdrawal. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We cannot predict how successful we will be at enrolling subjects in future clinical trials. Subject enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u00b7\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u00b7\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate in the trial;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of drugs approved to treat the skin disease in the trial;\n\u00b7\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u00b7\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us or them to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, we rely on and expect to continue to rely on CROs and clinical\ntrial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we will have limited influence over their performance.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, or serious adverse or unacceptable side effects may be identified during the development of our drug candidates, which could prevent or delay marketing approval and commercialization, increase our costs or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our drug candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approvals for the commercial sale of our drug candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our drug candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication, and failures can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical trials often fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the drug candidate studied for the target indication.\nIf our drug candidates are associated with side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses in which the side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The FDA or an institutional review board may also require that we suspend, discontinue, or limit our clinical trials based on safety information. Such findings could further result in regulatory authorities failing to provide marketing authorization for our drug candidates. Many drug candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the drug candidate.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by our drugs, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approval to market such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the labels;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation and physician or patient acceptance of our products may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular drug candidate and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in methods of drug candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs drug candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval. Any of these changes could cause our drug candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our drug candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenue.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to increase our pipeline of drug candidates, including by in-licensing or acquiring additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions.\nA key element of our strategy is to build and expand our pipeline of drug candidates. In addition, we intend to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. We may not be able to identify or develop drug candidates that are safe, tolerable and effective. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential drug candidates that we identify, in-license or acquire may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on development programs and drug candidates that we identify for specific indications. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, ATI-501 and ATI-502 for the treatment of AA and ATI-450 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs and drug candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable drugs. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such drug candidate.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of ESKATA, RHOFADE and Our Drug Candidates\nESKATA, RHOFADE and any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nESKATA, RHOFADE and any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval, may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If ESKATA, RHOFADE and our drug candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of ESKATA, RHOFADE and, if approved, any drug candidate, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy, safety and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new treatments and of physicians to prescribe these treatments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain a sales force in the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for procedures using ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u00b7\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nWe have a savings card program for RHOFADE to provide assistance to eligible patients with out-of-pocket costs for the patient\u2019s usage of RHOFADE. Changes to or elimination of the savings card program could adversely affect the frequency with which health care providers prescribe RHOFADE, the availability of RHOFADE at pharmacies and the demand for and use of RHOFADE by patients.\nIf we are unable to establish effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for ESKATA and RHOFADE, or a drug candidate that may receive marketing approval, we may not be successful in commercializing ESKATA or RHOFADE or those drug candidates if and when they are approved.\nTo achieve commercial success for ESKATA and RHOFADE and any drug candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, we will need to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote ESKATA and RHOFADE and, if approved, some of our drug candidates in the United States. We have begun this process and have hired a sales force for ESKATA and RHOFADE, but there are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any drug launch. If the commercial launch of a drug candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred\nthese commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our drugs on our own include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to health care providers or persuade adequate numbers of health care providers to prescribe our products;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary drugs to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to establish our own effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our revenue and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute any drugs that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our drug candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our drugs effectively. If we do not establish effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products or drug candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current products, and will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.\nWith respect to ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, we are aware of two biopharmaceutical companies developing drug candidates which target SK, one company that is developing a device to target SK, and another company that currently markets a line of cosmetic products targeting skin conditions, including SK. We are also aware of early research being conducted with Akt inhibitors as a potential treatment for SK.\nWith respect to RHOFADE for the treatment of persistent facial erythema (redness) due to rosacea, we are aware of one other drug that is approved for this indication: MIRVASO (brimonidine) topical gel, 0.33%, which was approved by the FDA in 2013, is currently marketed by Galderma Laboratories, L.P.\nWith respect to A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, we are aware of one company that received a CE Mark approval for an over-the-counter treatment for the non-surgical removal of warts, and four companies developing drug candidates for the treatment of common warts. In addition, other drugs have been used off-label as treatments for common warts.\nWith respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502 for the treatment of AA, we anticipate competing with sensitizing agents such as diphencyprone, and topical, intralesional and systemic corticosteroids, which have been found to occasionally reduce symptoms of AA. Other treatments utilized for patchy AA include anthralin and minoxidil solution. We may also compete with companies developing chemical agents to be used in topical immunotherapies, as well as companies developing biologics, immunosuppressive agents, laser therapy, phototherapy, other JAK inhibitors and prostaglandin analogues to treat AA.\nWith respect to ATI-502 for the treatment of vitiligo, we are aware of one other company developing a topical JAK inhibitor for the treatment of vitiligo.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than ESKATA, RHOFADE or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nWe expect third-party payors generally will not cover the use of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs and, accordingly, our success will be dependent upon the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for ESKATA.\nWe do not expect third-party payors to cover and reimburse providers who use ESKATA on patients for the treatment of raised SKs. Third-party payors generally do not reimburse the provider for the product used to remove non-malignant lesions, including SK. In addition, they do not generally reimburse providers for the procedure removing such lesions, since the procedure is considered to be cosmetic in nature, unless there is a medical need to remove the lesion such as confirming a diagnosis with a biopsy or treating SK that are causing the patient physical discomfort. We anticipate that in some cases, ESKATA will be used to remove SK lesions that are inflamed and causing the patient discomfort. Any reduction in reimbursement for the procedure to remove inflamed SK may result in a higher percentage of patients needing to pay out of pocket for ESKATA. Accordingly, the commercial success of ESKATA depends on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for the in-office procedure.\nThe success of RHOFADE and A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts or our other drug candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on coverage and adequate reimbursement or the willingness of patients to pay for these products.\nIn the case of RHOFADE, we believe our success will depend on continued coverage and adequate reimbursement, and in the case of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts or our other drug candidates, if approved, on obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement, for a prescription treatment or in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement, on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for our prescription drug products.\nThird-party payors determine which prescription drug products they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including: the third-party payor\u2019s determination that a product is safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals or current clinical practice guidelines; and whether there are competitive products, either branded or generic, and the pricing of those products. Many private third-party payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to drug products\u2019 coverage partly to control costs for their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate reimbursement or pricing terms for our products with third-party payors at levels that are profitable to us, or at all.\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. Accordingly, these updates could impact the demand for RHOFADE or A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts or our other drug candidates, if approved. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and government and third-party private health insurance coverage and reimbursement may not be available to patients or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the Affordable Care Act and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future. In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we or any potential partners could receive for any of our products and could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot predict how pending and future health care legislation will impact our business, and any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our products or drug candidates could harm our business.\nForeign governments also have their own health care reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and we cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to our products under any foreign reimbursement system. In some foreign countries, including major markets in the European Union and Japan, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take up to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a pharmacoeconomic study that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. Such pharmacoeconomic studies can be costly and the results uncertain. Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any of our products or drug candidates that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in human clinical trials and an even greater risk relating to the commercialization of ESKATA and RHOFADE. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our drug candidates or drugs caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products or any drug candidates that we may develop;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards paid to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nproduct recall or withdrawal from the market or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our products or any drug candidates that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may need to increase our insurance coverage and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our future clinical trials for drug candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe engage CROs to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct those clinical trials. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to timely enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, any third parties conducting our clinical trials will not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed significantly.\nSwitching or adding CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and generally do not control their activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for the commercialization of ESKATA and RHOFADE and for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of our drugs, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ESKATA and RHOFADE and for the supply of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of ESKATA, RHOFADE or our drug candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ESKATA and RHOFADE and supply of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. For example, we have entered into an exclusive, ten-year, automatically renewable supply agreement with PeroxyChem, a manufacturer of hydrogen peroxide, to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient that can be used in ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, a manufacturing and supply agreement with a third party for the finished dosage form of RHOFADE, and an exclusive commercial supply agreement with James Alexander for the manufacture of the finished dosage form of ESKATA. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or drug candidates at an acceptable cost and/or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our clinical trials or our other development or commercialization efforts.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and drug candidates must be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA or comparable marketing application to the FDA or other regulatory authority. We do not have control over a supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s compliance with laws, regulations and applicable cGMP standards and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our drug candidates or if it withdraws any such approval for our products or drug candidates in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to commercialize our products and to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market, if approved, our drug candidates.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u00b7\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u00b7\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u00b7\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u00b7\nthe possible increase in costs by our third party suppliers for the active pharmaceutical ingredients in ESKATA and RHOFADE;\n\u00b7\nthe possible increase in costs by our manufacturers for the finished dosage forms of ESKATA and RHOFADE; and\n\u00b7\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nOur products and drug candidates that we may develop may compete with other products and drug candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for the components of ESKATA or RHOFADE.\nIf our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. We may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nWe expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our products and drug candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any drug candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe may seek collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of our drug candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these drug candidates.\nWe may seek third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, including for the commercialization of any of our drug candidates that are approved for marketing outside the United States. Our likely collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our drug candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any drug candidates that achieve marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or drug candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7\ndrug candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own products or drug candidates, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our drug candidates that achieve marketing approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such drug candidates;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u00b7\ncollaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable drug candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of drug candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our drug development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our drug candidates will require substantial additional capital. For some of our drug candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those drug candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative drug candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such\na collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our drug candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such drug candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our drug candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue.\nOur sublease could terminate if the master lease is terminated for any reason, thus terminating our rights to our corporate headquarters.\nWe sublease space for our corporate headquarters. While the term of the sublease extends until October 2023, if for any reason the master lease is terminated or expires prior to October 2023, our sublease will also automatically terminate. In such an event, we would need to obtain a new direct lease with the master landlord or negotiate and enter into a new lease for office space at a different location, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products or drug candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology, products and drug candidates may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our products and drug candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our products and drug candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, however, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or drugs, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drugs. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to\ncommercialize our technology or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications that we own, or license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future drug candidates.\nEven if our patent applications that we own or license issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or drugs in a non-infringing manner. For example, the patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Columbia University that are primarily directed to methods of treating hair loss disorders with JAK inhibitors may not issue, have issued and or may issue with claims directed to the use of specific JAK inhibitors that we do not intend to commercialize, or may not issue with claims directed to the use of JAK inhibitors that our competitors may commercialize.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs. Our issued U.S. patents, with claims directed to treatment of SK and acrochordons with high-concentration hydrogen peroxide of at least 23%, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, are scheduled to expire in 2022, and our issued U.S. patents with claims directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, and methods of use and applicators for the same are scheduled to expire in 2035. The issued U.S. patents that we exclusively license from Allergan relating to methods of treating erythema associated with rosacea by topically administering oxymetazoline or other alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonists, which cover the approved use of RHOFADE, expire between January 2024 and May 2028. The issued U.S. patent that covers cream formulations of oxymetazoline, including RHOFADE, expires in December 2031. The issued U.S. patents relating to methods of treating facial erythema associated with rosacea by topically administering once or twice daily 1% or 1.5% oxymetazoline expire in June 2035. The patents and applications that we exclusively sublicense from Allergan that may relate to RHOFADE expire in May 2024. Certain issued U.S. patents relating to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are scheduled to expire in 2023 and additional U.S. patents, with claims specifically directed to such JAK inhibitors, are scheduled to expire in 2030. The issued U.S. and Japanese patents that we exclusively license from Columbia University with claims directed to the use of third party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, expire in 2031. We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our soft-JAK inhibitors, but any claims that may issue would expire in 2038. Our issued U.S. patent covering our lead inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway inhibitor, expires in 2034 and other issued patents covering different MK-2 signaling pathway inhibitors expire in 2031 and 2032. Our issued patents covering our novel inhibitors of ITK expire between 2035 and 2038. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar administrative proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the\nvalidity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products and drug candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would harm our business.\nIn such a proceeding, a court or administrative board may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology. An adverse result in any such proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may find it impractical or undesirable to enforce our intellectual property against some third parties. For instance, we are aware of third parties that have marketed high-concentration hydrogen peroxide solutions over the internet for the treatment of SK and warts. These parties do not appear to have regulatory authority, and we have not authorized them in any way to market these products. However, to date we have refrained from seeking to enforce our intellectual property rights against these third parties due to the transient nature of their activities.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe are aware that a third party generic pharmaceutical company completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in March 2018 evaluating the reduction in erythema in adults with moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea with a 1% oxymetazoline topical cream in comparison to an oxymetazoline reference listed drug. While conducting such a clinical trial may not be an act of patent infringement in the United States, such a clinical trial could serve as the basis for the third party to file an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a generic of RHOFADE that relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by Allergan, which could trigger a potential patent infringement lawsuit. If we were to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against such a third party for infringing any of the U.S. patents relating to methods of treating erythema associated with rosacea by topically administering oxymetazoline that we exclusively license from Allergan, we may be required to join Allergan as a party to such a lawsuit. In addition, if we were to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against a third party for infringing certain patents that we sublicense from Allergan relating to the use of oxymetazoline for treating rosacea or purpura by topical application, we may also be required to join Allergan and another third party as parties to such a lawsuit. Any such lawsuit could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims or a finding of non-infringement and the approval of a generic version of RHOFADE sooner than anticipated.\nWith respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502, if we do not elect to exercise our first right to do so, Rigel may enforce the licensed patents relating to ATI-501 and ATI-502 against any infringing third party in the field of dermatology. In addition, Rigel has the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the licensed patents relating to ATI-501 and ATI-502 against any infringing party outside of the field of dermatology. With respect to the licensed patents from Columbia University, Columbia University has the first right to initiate, control and defend any proceedings related to the validity, enforceability or infringement of the licensed patent rights and in doing so, has no obligation to assert more than one licensed patent in one jurisdiction against a third party. With respect to the licensed patents from Columbia University, if Columbia University does not elect to exercise its first right to do so, we may enforce the licensed patent rights relating to an infringement of the licensed patent rights against any infringing third party.\nThe RHOFADE patents that we exclusively license from Allergan are subject to a cross-license agreement with a third party, which place obligations and limitations on our ability to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents solely as they relate to an alpha adrenoreceptor agonist that is not oxymetazoline.\nWe exclusively license from Allergan a family of U.S. patents and applications relating to methods of treating erythema associated with rosacea by topically administering oxymetazoline or other alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonists, which expire between January 2024 and May 2028. This patent family covers the approved use of RHOFADE. This patent family is also subject to an exclusive license granted by Allergan to a third party, which places obligations and limitations\non our ability to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents solely as they relate to an alpha adrenoreceptor agonist that is not oxymetazoline.\nIf we breach our license agreement with Rigel, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our JAK inhibitors ATI-501 and ATI-502.\nIn August 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rigel, which grants us the rights to certain patent rights and other intellectual property owned by them relating to the JAK inhibitors ATI-501 and ATI-502 in the field of dermatology. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under this license agreement, including failure to make payments to Rigel when due for royalties and failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a JAK inhibitor, Rigel has the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed Rigel\u2019s patent rights and other intellectual property would end. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights and other intellectual property licensed to us under the license agreement with Rigel.\nIf we breach our agreement with the Selling Stockholders of Vixen, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our JAK inhibitors.\nIn March 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the stockholders of Vixen, pursuant to which we purchased all of the stock of Vixen and assumed its license agreement with Columbia University. If we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a JAK inhibitor for AA and a JAK inhibitor for AGA, the license agreement with Columbia University will be transferred to the Selling Stockholders of Vixen following any adverse resolution of any dispute relating thereto. Upon the effective date of such transfer, our right to practice the licensed Columbia University patent rights and know-how would end.\nIf we breach our agreement with Columbia University, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our JAK inhibitors.\nIn March 2016, as part of the Vixen acquisition, we assumed a license agreement with Columbia University, which grants us the right under certain patent rights and know-how owned by Columbia University relating to the use of JAK inhibitors to treat hair-loss disorders. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under this license agreement, including failure to make payments to Columbia University when due for royalties and failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product, Columbia University has the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed Columbia University patent rights and know-how would end. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights and know-how licensed to us under the license agreement, and, to the extent such patent rights and know-how relate to our JAK inhibitors, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for ATI-501 or ATI-502.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products and drug candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. For example, the use of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs is currently covered by patents in the United States, Australia, India and New Zealand, but not in the European Union or other countries. The use of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of warts is currently covered by issued patents in the United States, Australia, India and New Zealand, but not in the European Union or other countries. A U.S. patent is issued, and patent applications are pending in the United States, the European Union and other foreign countries directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution and methods of use. With respect to RHOFADE, the family of patents and applications relating to methods of treating erythema associated with rosacea by topically administering oxymetazoline or other alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonists, which expire between January 2024 and May 2028, is not filed outside of the United States. Accordingly, the patent protection for RHOFADE outside of the United States is based upon a family of patents and applications in the United States, the European Union and other major foreign markets that cover certain cream formulations of oxymetazoline, including RHOFADE, which expires in December 2031 and a family of patents and applications in the United States, the European Union and other major foreign markets relating to methods of treating facial erythema associated with rosacea by topically administering once or twice daily 1% or 1.5% oxymetazoline, which expires in June 2035. The approved use of RHOFADE\nmay also be covered by certain patents and applications in the United States, the European Union and other major foreign markets that expire in May 2024, which we exclusively sublicense from Allergan.\nOur JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are currently covered in patents and applications in the United States, the European Union, and other major foreign markets. Additionally, U.S. and Japanese patents have issued in the patent portfolio licensed from Columbia University, which are directed to the use of certain third party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders and applications are pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our invention in such countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our products and drug candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nMany countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our products and drug candidates. For example, we exclusively license patents from Allergan related to the use of alpha-1 adrenergic agonists for the treatment of erythema related to rosacea, which cover the approved use of RHOFDADE, and we exclusively license intellectual property from Rigel in the field of dermatology related to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502. We also exclusively license intellectual property from Columbia University related to the use of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products and drug candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nOur third-party licensors may develop JAK inhibitors, including those related to our drug candidates, outside of the field of dermatology.\nWe exclusively license intellectual property from Rigel in order to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 in the field of dermatology. Rigel has retained the rights under such intellectual property to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 outside of the field of dermatology. If Rigel were to commercialize such JAK inhibitors outside the field of dermatology, such a product could possibly be used off-label for a dermatology indication, which could negatively impact sales of our drug candidates, if approved. Rigel also retained the intellectual property rights to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize other structurally similar JAK inhibitors. If Rigel commercializes a structurally similar JAK inhibitor, such a product could directly compete with our drug candidates, if approved.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products or drug candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our drugs and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our drug candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our drugs and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or drug. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could hinder current commercialization efforts of our products or prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates, if approved, or force us to cease some of our business operations. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing product or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we, our employees or our licensors have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we and our licensors try to ensure that our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we or our licensors may be subject to claims that these employees, our licensors or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we or our licensors fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we and our licensors are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings\nadequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, or in-license needed technology or other drug candidates. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace, including compromising our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking and maintaining patents for our products and drug candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nThe validity, scope and enforceability of any of our patents that cover ESKATA, RHOFADE, A-101 45% Topical Solution or any of our other drug candidates can be challenged by competitors.\nThe likelihood that a third party will challenge our patents covering ESKATA or RHOFADE is increased because these are marketed products. The challenge may come in the form of a patent office proceeding, such as an inter partes review, challenging the validity of the patents or a district court proceeding, such as a paragraph IV litigation arising out of the filing of an ANDA.\nIf a third party files an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a generic of ESKATA or RHOFADE, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) there is no patent information listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book with respect to our NDA for the applicable approved drug; (2) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third party's generic drug. A certification that the new drug will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for the applicable approved drug, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third party's ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third party\u2019s ANDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third party\u2019s ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay of FDA approval. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management's attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing with ESKATA or RHOFADE. We are aware that a third party generic pharmaceutical company completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in March 2018 evaluating the reduction in erythema in adults with moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea with a 1% oxymetazoline topical cream in comparison to an oxymetazoline reference listed drug. Such a clinical trial could serve as the basis for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2)\napplication for a generic of RHOFADE that relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by Allergan, triggering the potential for a paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement lawsuit. Any such lawsuit could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims or a finding of non-infringement and the approval of a generic version of RHOFADE sooner than anticipated.\nIf A-101 45% Topical Solution, our JAK inhibitors, or any of our other drug candidates advance through development or is approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the current patents, or patents that may issue in the future, within our portfolio covering these drug candidates. Any such challenge could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims or a finding of non-infringement.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act by extending the patent term and obtaining data exclusivity for our products and drug candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur commercial success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology, products, drug candidates and our target indications. Our issued U.S. patent with claims directed to treatment of SK with ESKATA is scheduled to expire in 2022 and our issued U.S. formulation patent with claims directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, and methods of use is scheduled to expire in 2035. Certain issued U.S. patents relating to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are scheduled to expire in 2023 and additional U.S. patents, with claims specifically directed to such JAK inhibitors, are scheduled to expire in 2030. The issued U.S. and Japanese patents licensed from Columbia University relating to the use of certain third party JAK inhibitor for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, expire in 2031. Our issued U.S. patent covering our lead inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway inhibitor, expires in 2034 and other issued patents covering different MK-2 signaling pathway inhibitors expire in 2031 and 2032. Our issued patents covering our novel inhibitors of ITK expire between 2035 and 2038. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting our drug candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our drug candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a drug candidate. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent extension term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent as compensation for patent term lost during development and the FDA regulatory review process, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the total patent term including the period of extension cannot exceed 14 years from the product\u2019s approval date. Furthermore, this extension is limited to only one patent per regulatory review period that covers the approved product. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. We believe that ESKATA is eligible for patent term extension and we have filed an application with the USPTO requesting patent term extension for one patent that covers ESKATA; however, the USPTO and/or the FDA may disagree with our interpretation.\nIf we are unable to extend the expiration date of our existing patents or obtain new patents with longer expiry dates, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data to obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. For example, even if we obtain new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity for ESKATA, we could be subject to generic competition as early as the end of the applicable exclusivity period, if our patent portfolio does not have sufficient term or scope to prevent such generic competition.\nAny trademarks we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our products that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark\napplications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOutside of the United States we cannot be certain that any country\u2019s patent or trademark office will not implement new rules that could seriously affect how we draft, file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications.\nWe cannot be certain that the patent or trademark offices of countries outside the United States will not implement new rules that increase costs for drafting, filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications or that any such new rules will not restrict our ability to file for patent protection. For example, we may elect not to seek patent protection in some jurisdictions or for some products or drug candidates in order to save costs. We may be forced to abandon or return the rights to specific patents due to a lack of financial resources.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make formulations or compositions that are the same as or similar to ESKATA, RHOFADE and A-101 45% Topical Solution but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make a JAK inhibitor that is similar to the JAK inhibitors we intend to commercialize that is not covered by the patents that we exclusively license and have the right to enforce;\n\u00b7\nwe, our licensors or any collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own;\n\u00b7\nwe, our licensors or any collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we own or exclusively license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Drug Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our drug candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur drug candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Commission and EU Member State Competent Authorities and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a drug candidate will prevent us from commercializing the drug candidate. Other than the approval of ESKATA in the United States, Sweden, United Kingdom, Iceland and Belgium, we have not received approval to market any of our drug candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing\nmarketing approval also requires the submission of information about the drug manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our drug candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If any of our drug candidates receive marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the drug.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted drug application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a drug candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved drug not commercially viable.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our drug candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our drugs in the European Union and any other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in any market.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our drug candidates internationally could harm our business.\nWe are seeking marketing approval for ESKATA outside of the United States, and we may also seek marketing approval for RHOFADE or our drug candidates currently in development and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u00b7\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\nforeign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u00b7\npotential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u00b7\nlogistical challenges resulting from distributing ESKATA, RHOFADE or our drug candidates to foreign countries; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may compromise our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nESKATA, RHOFADE or any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nESKATA, RHOFADE or any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such drug candidate, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a drug candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. If any of our drug candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the drug.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the drug. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our drugs for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on drug distribution or use;\n\u00b7\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\nrecall or withdrawal of the drugs from the market;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7\nclinical holds;\n\u00b7\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u00b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our drugs;\n\u00b7\ndrug seizure; or\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of drugs for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nOur relationships with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other health care laws and regulations, which could expose us to significant penalties.\nHealth care providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any of our drugs and drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign health care laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The intent standard was further amended by the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil False Claims Act (that can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions), and the civil monetary penalties law, which impose criminal and civil penalties, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act) and its implementing regulations, which requires specified manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the CMS information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians, which is defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and teaching hospitals, as well as applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. All such reported information is publicly available; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to health care providers; state, local and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report pricing information regarding certain drugs; and/or that require registration of certain employees engaged in marketing activities in the location; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our relationships with physicians and other health care providers, some of whom may recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations. By way of example, some of our consulting arrangements with physicians may not meet all of the criteria of the personal services safe harbor under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Accordingly, they may not qualify for safe harbor protection from government prosecution. A business arrangement that does not substantially comply with a safe harbor, however, is not necessarily illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but may be subject to additional scrutiny by the government.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other health care providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable\nlaws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government health care programs, which could also materially affect our business.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of our drug candidates and commercialize our products and drug candidates, if approved, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States, and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products or drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nAmong the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our products and potential drug candidates are the following:\n\u00b7\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government health care programs;\n\u00b7\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, which include, among other things, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;\n\u00b7\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u00b7\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u00b7\nthe new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;\n\u00b7\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u00b7\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nSince its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to, as well efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, on January\n22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, has stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that became effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any similar new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for ESKATA and RHOFADE and, if approved, our drug candidates, and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other health care reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump Administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump Administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal health care programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their drugs, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have both stated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level,\nlegislatures have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIf ESKATA is not granted NCE exclusivity from the FDA, our period of marketing exclusivity for ESKATA will be shorter than previously anticipated, and our business could be harmed.\nUnder the FDCA, as amended by the Hatch-Waxman Act, a drug that is granted regulatory approval may be eligible for five years of marketing exclusivity in the United States following regulatory approval if that drug is classified as an NCE. A drug can be classified as an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.\nThe FDA published a determination on the marketing exclusivity of ESKATA in a cumulative supplement to its Orange Book and determined that ESKATA is eligible for a three-year period of exclusivity for a new product, which would continue until December 14, 2020, rather than the five-year exclusivity for an NCE. While we believe we are entitled to an NCE determination for ESKATA, to date the FDA has not agreed with our position. Although we have appealed the FDA\u2019s decision, there can be no assurance that ESKATA will be granted NCE exclusivity, or that the FDA will make a determination on such appeal of their exclusivity decision in a timely manner.\nNCE marketing exclusivity, if granted, would preclude approval during the five-year exclusivity period of certain 505(b)(2) applications or ANDAs that rely upon the FDA\u2019s findings of safety and efficacy for ESKATA. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. In this case, we may be afforded the benefit of a 30-month stay against the launch of such a competitive product that would extend from the end of the five-year exclusivity period, and may also be afforded other extensions under applicable regulations, including a judicial extension if applicable requirements are met. If we are not able to gain or exploit the period of marketing exclusivity, we may face significant competitive threats from other manufacturers, including the manufacturers of generic alternatives. Further, even if ESKATA is considered to be an NCE and we are able to gain five-year marketing exclusivity, another company could challenge that decision to seek to overturn the FDA\u2019s determination.\nESKATA has been granted three years of new product exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A three-year period of exclusivity is granted under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved when the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application. Our clinical trials of ESKATA were new clinical investigations that were essential to the approval of our NDA. We are entitled to at least three-year exclusivity even if the FDA determines that the hydrogen peroxide moiety was previously approved because our clinical investigations were essential for the approval of our new drug product, ESKATA.\nSuch three-year exclusivity protection precludes the FDA from approving a marketing application for 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA for the same conditions of approval as ESKATA for a period of three years from the date of ESKATA\u2019s FDA approval, i.e., through December 14, 2020 although the FDA may accept and commence review of such applications during the exclusivity period. This three-year form of exclusivity may also not prevent the FDA from approving an NDA that relies only on its own data to support the change or innovation. Any loss of exclusive marketing rights for ESKATA through introduction of generic or competing products would harm our financial position.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenue, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidate to other available procedures. If reimbursement of our drugs is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nThe inherent dangers in production and transportation of hydrogen peroxide could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in the use and transport of hydrogen peroxide, the active ingredient of ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution. Hydrogen peroxide can decompose in the presence of organic materials and is categorized as an oxidizer and is corrosive. Hydrogen peroxide should be stored in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas and away from any flammable or combustible substances. The hazards and risks associated with producing and transporting hydrogen peroxide include fires, explosions, third-party interference (including terrorism) and mechanical failure of equipment at our facilities or those of our supplier of hydrogen peroxide. The occurrence of any of these events could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to properties.\nWe are subject to governmental economic sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nAs a U.S. company, we are subject to U.S. import and export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations, and we are required to import and export our products and drug candidates, technology and services in compliance with those laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic embargo and trade sanction programs administered by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nU.S. economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are currently taking precautions to prevent doing any business, directly or indirectly, with countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions and\nto ensure that our products and drug candidates, are not exported or used by countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions, such measures may be circumvented.\nFurthermore, if we export our products or drug candidates, the exports may require authorizations, including a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorization. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Failure to comply with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may expose us to government investigations and penalties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or import or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, including possible incarceration for those individuals responsible for the violations, the loss of export or import privileges and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we commercialize our drug candidates and eventually commence international sales and business, we may engage with collaborators and third-party intermediaries to sell our products abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, development, clinical, financial, legal and business development expertise of Dr. Neal Walker, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Stuart Shanler, our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. David Gordon, our Chief Medical Officer, Frank Ruffo, our Chief Financial Officer, and Kamil Ali-Jackson, our Chief Legal Officer, as well as the other members of our scientific and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, each of them may currently terminate their employment with us or resign at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our key executives other than for Dr. Walker.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of our drug pipeline toward scaling up for commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain marketing approval of and commercialize drugs. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our\ndevelopment and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 169 full-time and part-time employees. As we progress, we expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state health care laws and regulations, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we are subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Confluence.\nIn August 2017, we acquired Confluence, including several preclinical drug candidates and Confluence\u2019s contract research services business. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Confluence. Specifically, we are subject to the risks that:\n\u00b7\nwe receive inadequate or unfavorable data from preclinical studies or clinical trials evaluating the acquired preclinical drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nwe fail to manage the complexities resulting from the larger combined company with distant business locations; and\n\u00b7\nwe fail to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger could be adversely affected, or could reduce our future earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of RHOFADE.\nThe success of our acquisition of RHOFADE will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize operating synergies from combining RHOFADE with our portfolio of drug candidates and ESKATA.\nThe failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered include the following:\n\u00b7\ncomplexities associated with managing an additional commercial-stage drug;\n\u00b7\ntraining our sales force to market both ESKATA and RHOFADE;\n\u00b7\ncurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with our company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;\n\u00b7\nour due diligence processes in connection with the acquisition may fail to identify significant problems, risks, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges associated with the RHOFADE assets, including problems, risks, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality and safety and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u00b7\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the acquisition and integrating RHOFADE.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could be adversely affected, or could reduce our future earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nPrior to our initial public offering in October 2015, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell the shares at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nSince our initial public offering, our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of any clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nany delay in our regulatory filings for any of our drug candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n\u00b7\nadverse results from, delays in or termination of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive marketing approval of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of ESKATA, RHOFADE or any drug candidate;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nstock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biotechnology industry;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u00b7\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u00b7\ngeneral political and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. Equity research analysts may elect not to initiate or continue to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Even if we have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plan or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plan or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering the issuance of shares of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered under these registration statements are available for sale in the public market subject to\nvesting arrangements and exercise of options, and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act in the case of our affiliates.\nAdditionally, certain holders of shares of our common stock, or their transferees, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change of control was considered favorable by some or all of our stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u00b7\nonly one of our three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u00b7\nstockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 662/3% vote and only for cause;\n\u00b7\nstockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u00b7\nstockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nstockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own a substantial portion of our common stock. As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\n\u00b7\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure in this report;\n\u00b7\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and\n\u00b7\nnot being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2020, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th and (4) any date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nWe also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we benefit from some of the same scaled disclosure requirements.\nUnder Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is listed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This requires that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts.\nWe may identify weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $199.5 million and $212.4 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2032. As of December 31, 2018, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $4.9 million which begin to expire in 2032, and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.1 million which begin to expire in 2022. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have completed an analysis under Section 382 for net operating loss carryforwards generated from July 13, 2012 through December 31, 2016. Although we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes since 2012, we have concluded that we should have sufficient ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards accumulated during the periods tested. We have not yet determined if a Section 382 ownership change has occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, or for Confluence prior to the acquisition. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nThe 2017 comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The federal income tax legislation, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the changes to the federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain how various states will respond to the changes in the federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of proceeds from our equity financing transactions and may invest or spend the proceeds in ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may not increase the value of your investment.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from our equity financing transactions over the last several years. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of the proceeds may not yield any return on your investment. We expect to use the net proceeds from those transactions to conduct commercial activities for ESKATA and RHOFADE, and to fund the continued research and development of our drug candidates, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our failure to apply the net proceeds effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these net proceeds. Stockholders will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use these net proceeds.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our current loan agreement with Oxford prohibits us, and future debt agreements may also preclude us, from paying dividends. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we have begun, and will continue, particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other costs. These additional costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15775, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACRS"}
