RISK FACTORS.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, projected or implied in any forward-looking statement, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below which constitute material risks and uncertainties known to us that we believe could affect our future growth, results of operations, performance and business prospects and opportunities. You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all the potential risks and\nIndex to Financial Statements\nuncertainties regarding our business and the trading price of our securities. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, may adversely impact our business and the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry, and if we do not maintain or expand our market share, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe market for our products and services is fragmented, intensely competitive and characterized by the frequent introduction of new products and services and by rapidly evolving industry standards, technology and client needs. Our revenue cycle management products and services compete with products and services provided by large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities, including: information technology providers such as Allscripts Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Siemens AG; consulting and outsourcing firms such as Accenture Ltd., Accretive Health, Inc., Deloitte &Touche LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, Huron Consulting, Inc., Navigant Consulting, Inc., PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, The Advisory Board Company and Truven Healthcare Analytics; and providers of competitive products and services such as Conifer (a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare), Craneware Inc., Emdeon Inc., Optum (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Inc.), Parallon (a subsidiary of HCA, Inc.), Passport Health Communications (a subsidiary of Experian), RelayHealth (a subsidiary of McKesson Corporation) and The SSI Group, Inc. We also compete with hundreds of smaller niche companies. The primary competitors to our SCM products and services are other large GPOs, such as Amerinet Inc., HealthTrust LLC, Novation LLC and Premier, Inc., as well as a number of the consulting firms named above.\nWith respect to both our RCM and SCM products and services, we compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver financial improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition, ability to integrate services with existing technology and price. Many of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition, have larger client bases and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Other of our competitors have proprietary technology that differentiates their product and service offerings from ours. As a result of these competitive advantages, our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands, products and services and make more attractive offers to clients. In addition, many GPOs are associated with provider-clients of the GPO through equity ownership or other financial interests, which enables our competitors to distinguish themselves on that basis.\nWe expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could harm our business. Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power and regulatory and economic conditions may encourage additional consolidation. Also, some healthcare systems and insurers are vertically integrating to facilitate tighter coordination of care necessary to deliver differentiated clinical quality. Some large healthcare systems may choose to contract directly with vendors for some supply categories; just as some vendors may seek to contract directly with providers rather than with GPOs. Additionally, providers could choose to create their own GPOs. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of existing relationships with industry participants will become greater. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our current clients or expand our client base in this competitive environment.\nAdditionally, as a result of agreements that we have entered into in the recent past with certain of our clients, a larger portion of our revenue is now attributable to a smaller group of clients. Although no single client\nIndex to Financial Statements\naccounted for more than ten percent of our total net revenue as of December 31, 2014, any significant loss of business from these large clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, in February 2015, we announced the appointment of R. Halsey Wise to the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company succeeding John A. Bardis, the company\u2019s founder, who retired. Mr. Bardis will continue to serve the company as a consultant to support client relationships; however, we could experience client losses as a result of this leadership change. If we do not retain current clients or expand our client base, our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nWe expect to conduct a full assessment of our business which could significantly impact our financial results.\nAs a result of our appointment of Mr. Wise to the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we expect to perform a complete assessment of our business. Actions taken following this assessment may involve a change in strategy and operations, which could substantially impact our financial results and may include certain restructuring and other related charges.\nWe may face pricing pressures that could limit our ability to maintain or increase prices for our products and services.\nWe may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales arising from various sources, including, without limitation, competition within the industry, consolidation of healthcare industry participants, practices of managed care organizations, government actions affecting reimbursement and clients who experience significant financial stress. If our competitors are able to offer products and services that result, or that are perceived to result, in client financial improvement that is substantially similar to or better than the financial improvement generated by our products and services, we may be forced to compete on the basis of additional attributes, such as charging lower prices or increasing the revenue share obligation that we pay our GPO provider-clients, to remain competitive. As healthcare providers consolidate to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services. If we cannot demonstrate the ability to increase vendor market share of healthcare provider purchases through our GPO, we may have less negotiating leverage with our contracted vendors which may result in our inability to maintain our client agreements or win new business. Additionally, our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship are affected by changes in regulations and limitations in governmental spending for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Government actions could limit government spending for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, limit payments to healthcare providers, and increase emphasis on competition and other programs that could have an adverse effect on our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship.\nIf our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, because cash flow from operations funds our working capital requirements, reduced profitability could require us to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need.\nIf we are not able to offer new and valuable products and services, we may not remain competitive and our revenue and results of operations may suffer.\nOur success depends on providing products and services that healthcare providers use to improve financial performance. Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients. Our products may become obsolete in light of rapidly evolving industry standards, technology and client needs, including changing regulations and provider reimbursement policies, such as the transition from fee-for-service reimbursement models to value-based payment, bundled payment and episodic care models. Additionally, some healthcare information technology providers have begun to incorporate enhanced revenue cycle management analytical tools and functionality into their core product and service\nIndex to Financial Statements\nofferings used by healthcare providers. These developments may adversely impact the demand for our products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services, maintain or improve our product category rankings and introduce new high-quality products and services that clients and potential clients will want. Many of our client relationships are nonexclusive or terminable on short notice, or otherwise terminable after a specified term. If our new or modified product and service innovations are not responsive to client preferences or industry or regulatory changes, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market, we may lose existing clients and be unable to obtain new clients and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe may experience significant delays in generating, or an inability to generate, revenues if potential clients take substantial time in evaluating our products and services.\nA key element of our strategy is to market our products and services directly to large healthcare providers, such as health systems and acute care hospitals and to increase the number of our products and services utilized by existing clients. The evaluation process is often lengthy and involves significant technical evaluation and commitment of personnel by these organizations. The use of our products and services may also be delayed due to an inability or reluctance to change or modify existing procedures. Additionally, healthcare providers\u2019 resources may be focused on other mission critical initiatives which could delay their evaluation of our products and services. If we are unable to sell additional products and services to existing clients in a timely fashion, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nUnsuccessful implementation of our products and services with our clients may harm our future financial success.\nSome of our new-client projects are complex and require lengthy and significant work to implement our products and services. Each client\u2019s situation may be different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet respective implementation responsibilities. If the client implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed, our relationships with the clients, and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. In addition, cancellation of any implementation of our products and services after it has begun may involve the loss to us of time, effort and resources invested in the cancelled implementation as well as lost opportunity for acquiring other clients over that same period of time. These factors may also contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain our strategic alliances or enter into new alliances, we may be unable to grow our current base business.\nOur business strategy includes entering into strategic alliances and affiliations with leading healthcare service and information technology providers. We work closely with our strategic partners to either expand our penetration in certain areas or classes of trade, or expand our market capabilities. We may not achieve our objectives through these alliances. Many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant to their business. These companies may pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products and services that compete with our products and services. In addition, in many cases, these companies may terminate their relationships with us with little or no notice. If existing alliances are terminated or we are unable to enter into alliances with leading healthcare service and information technology providers, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market presence.\nIf the protection of our intellectual property is inadequate, our competitors may gain access to our technology or confidential information and we may lose our competitive advantage.\nOur success as a company depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.\nIndex to Financial Statements We utilize a combination of internal and external measures to protect our proprietary software and confidential information. Such measures include contractual protections with employees, contractors, clients, and partners, as well as U.S. copyright laws.\nWe protect the intellectual property in our software pursuant to customary contractual protections in our agreements that impose restrictions on our clients\u2019 ability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on non-disclosure and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that acknowledge our ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require each person to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. The disclosure to, or independent development by, a competitor of any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent could materially adversely affect any competitive advantage we may have over any such competitor.\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our rights or that we will be able to detect unauthorized uses of our proprietary products and services and take timely and effective steps to enforce our rights. If unauthorized uses were to occur, we might be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation to enforce our rights. We cannot assure you that we would prevail in any such litigation. If others were able to use our intellectual property, our business could be subject to greater pricing pressure.\nIf we are alleged to have infringed on the rights of others, we could incur unanticipated costs and be prevented from providing our products and services.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our applications\u2019 functionality overlaps with competitor products. While we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. Any intellectual property rights claim against us or our clients, with or without merit, could be expensive to litigate, cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.\nIn addition, a number of our contracts with our clients contain indemnity provisions whereby we indemnify them against certain losses that may arise from third-party claims that are brought in connection with the use of our products.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have limited visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nOur sources of data might restrict our use of or refuse to license data, which could adversely impact our ability to provide certain products or services.\nA portion of the data that we use is either purchased or licensed from third parties or is obtained from our clients for specific client engagements. We also obtain a portion of the data that we use from public records. We believe that we have all rights necessary to use the data that is incorporated into our products and services.\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHowever, in the future, data providers could withdraw their data from us if: there is a competitive or business reason to do so; if pricing or contractual terms are changed at renewal; if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data; or if judicial interpretations are issued restricting use of the data that we currently use in our products and services. Further, we cannot assure you that our licenses for information will allow us to use that information for all potential or contemplated applications and products. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw their data, our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nThe products or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \u201cApache-style\u201d licenses, \u201cBerkeley Software Distribution,\u201d \u201cBSD-style\u201d licenses and other open source licenses. We attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts have been or will be successful. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is somewhat unknown and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies. For example, we may be subjected to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that use particular open source software at no cost to the user; that we make available the source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software; and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license.\nIf an author or other party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages; be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software; and be required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our products. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, which could substantially help our competitors develop products that are similar to or better than ours.\nOur failure to license and integrate third-party technologies could harm our business.\nWe depend upon licenses from third-party vendors for some of the technology and data used in our applications, and for some of the technology platforms upon which these applications are built and operate, including Microsoft and Oracle. We also integrate into our proprietary applications and use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. Some of this software is proprietary and some is open source. These technologies may not be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could be difficult to replace once integrated into our own proprietary applications (although we currently believe this risk is remote given the \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d nature of these licenses and that standard operating procedures and practices utilized by these third parties would generally afford us sufficient time to effectively transition to other readily available sources without significant long-term impact to our business). Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated, which will harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex to Financial Statements Most of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions.\nWe intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities, which may subject us to considerable business and financial risk.\nWe have grown through, and anticipate that we will continue to grow through, acquisitions of competitive and complementary businesses. We evaluate potential acquisitions on an ongoing basis and regularly pursue acquisition opportunities. We may not be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities, assessing the value, strengths and weaknesses of these opportunities and consummating acquisitions on acceptable terms. Furthermore, suitable acquisition opportunities may not be made available or known to us. In addition, we may compete for certain acquisition targets with companies having greater financial resources than we do and may expend significant resources in acquisition attempts that prove unsuccessful. We anticipate that we may finance acquisitions through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility, other indebtedness and issuances of equity. Borrowings necessary to finance acquisitions may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Acquisitions may expose us to particular business and financial risks that include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness and assuming liabilities, known and unknown;\n\u2022\nincurring significant additional capital expenditures, transaction and operating expenses and other acquisition-related charges;\n\u2022\nexperiencing an adverse impact on our earnings from the amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as from any future impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets as a result of certain economic, competitive or regulatory changes impacting the fair value of these assets;\n\u2022\nfailing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nentering new markets with which we are not familiar; and\n\u2022\nfailing to retain key personnel, vendors and clients of the acquired businesses.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, or if we encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications or delays frequently encountered in connection with the integration of acquired entities and the expansion of operations, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired, we may fail to achieve anticipated cost-savings and we may be required to focus resources on integration of operations rather than on our primary product and service offerings.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and reduce the funds available to us for other purposes.\nWe have and may continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. On December 13, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement consisting of a five-year $250 million senior secured term A loan facility (\u201cTerm A Facility\u201d), a seven-year $300 million senior secured term B loan facility (\u201cTerm B Facility\u201d) and a five-year $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility of $25 million and a swing line sub-facility of $25 million. On September 8, 2014, the Company entered into a First Increase Joinder\nIndex to Financial Statements\nto the Credit Agreement (the \u201cFirst Increase Joinder\u201d). The First Increase Joinder increased the revolving commitment amount under the Credit Agreement by $100 million to $300 million. In addition, on November 16, 2010, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $325 million of senior notes due 2018. At December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of approximately $881 million.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health in the following ways:\n\u2022\na material portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on and principal of our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nour substantial degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or other adverse events in our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nour substantial degree of leverage could impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes limiting our ability to maintain the value of our assets and operations; and\n\u2022\nour revolving credit facility matures in December 2017, our Term A Facility matures in December 2017 and our Term B Facility matures in December 2019 (although our Term B Facility will mature on May 15, 2018 if our senior notes have not been repaid or refinanced in full by such date) . If cash flow from operations is less than our debt service responsibilities, we may face financial risk that could increase interest expense and hinder our ability to refinance our debt obligations.\nIn addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain, and agreements governing future indebtedness may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, ratios and tests that limit our ability to incur additional debt and engage in other activities that may be in our long-term best interests. For example, our credit facilities and indenture include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens on assets, engage in certain lines of business, engage in certain mergers or consolidations, dispose of assets, make certain investments or acquisitions, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into sale leaseback transactions, enter into negative pledges or pay dividends or make other restricted payments. Our credit facilities also include financial covenants, including requirements that we maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and ratios contained in our credit facilities and indenture or in the agreements governing our future indebtedness may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Our credit facilities and indenture prohibit us from making dividend payments on our common stock if we are not in compliance with our restricted payment covenants. If we were to experience any future event of default, if not waived or cured, it could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our credit facilities could proceed against the security granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders accelerate the payment of our indebtedness, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\u2022\nfinance unanticipated working capital requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u2022\nfund strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nacquire complementary businesses, technologies, products or services.\nIndex to Financial Statements Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our expansion, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders may be reduced, and these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the solutions we sell in certain jurisdictions, we may be subject to tax liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease.\nRules and regulations applicable to sales and use tax vary significantly from state to state. In addition, the applicability of these rules given the nature of our products and services is subject to change.\nWe may lose sales or incur significant costs should various tax jurisdictions be successful in imposing sales and use taxes on a broader range of products and services. A successful assertion by one or more tax jurisdictions that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our solutions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete and otherwise harm our business.\nIf one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include substantial interest and penalty charges. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned costs that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nAny significant increase in bad debt in excess of recorded estimates would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe initially evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors, including a specific client\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collections experience. Based on these assessments, we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a general reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we expect to collect from clients. Many of our clients are under intense financial pressure and their operations are characterized by declining or negative margins. If circumstances related to specific clients worsen, especially those of our larger clients, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, such as a limited ability to meet financial obligations due to bankruptcy, or if conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, the amount of accounts receivable that we are able to collect may be less than our previous estimates as we experience bad debt in excess of reserves previously recorded.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of certain factors, some of which may be outside of our control.\nCertain of our client contracts contain terms that result in revenue that is deferred and cannot be recognized until the occurrence of certain events. For example, accounting principles do not allow us to recognize revenue associated with the implementation of products and services until the implementation has been completed, at which time we begin to recognize revenue over the life of the contract or the estimated client relationship period, whichever is longer. In addition, subscription-based fees generally commence only upon completion of implementation. As a result, the period of time between contract signing and recognition of associated revenue may be lengthy, and we are not able to predict with certainty the period in which implementation will be completed.\nIndex to Financial Statements Certain of our contracts provide that some portion or all of our fees are at risk and refundable if our products and services do not result in the achievement of certain financial performance targets. To the extent that any revenue is subject to contingency for the non-achievement of a performance target, we only recognize revenue upon client confirmation that the financial performance targets have been achieved. If a client fails to provide such confirmation in a timely manner, our ability to recognize revenue will be delayed. Additionally, certain of our contracts include the potential for performance bonuses, which we may or may not earn when expected or at all.\nOur SCM segment relies on participating vendors to provide periodic reports of their sales volumes to our clients and resulting administrative fees to us. If a vendor fails to provide such reporting in a timely and accurate manner, our ability to recognize administrative fee revenue will be delayed or prevented.\nCertain of our fees are based on timing and volume of client invoices processed and payments received, which are often dependent upon factors outside of our control.\nOther fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of other factors, some of which are not within our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our products and services achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthe purchasing and budgeting cycles of our clients;\n\u2022\nthe lengthy sales cycles for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe impact of transaction fee and contingency fee arrangements with clients;\n\u2022\nchanges in our or our competitors\u2019 pricing policies or sales terms;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of our or our competitors\u2019 new product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nclient decisions, especially those involving our larger client relationships, regarding renewal or termination of their contracts;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our current and potential clients;\n\u2022\nunforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions and those circumstances experienced by our healthcare provider-clients such as variations in patient census and seasonal issues.\nWe base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue, and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term. If we have lower revenue than expected, we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response. Any significant shortfall in revenue would have a direct and material adverse impact on our results of operations. We believe that our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nIf we lose key personnel or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel. Our future success also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel,\nIndex to Financial Statements\neach of whom may be difficult to replace. In February 2015, we announced the appointment of R. Halsey Wise to the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company succeeding John A. Bardis, the company\u2019s founder, who retired but will continue to serve the company as a consultant to support client relationships. The loss of services of any of our executive officers or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. The replacement of any of these key individuals would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nRisks Related to Our Product and Service Offerings\nIf our products fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems, our business could suffer.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant. Complex software such as ours may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released. We continually introduce new software and updates and enhancements to our software. Despite testing by us, from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors may be discovered in the future. Defects and errors that are not timely detected and remedied could expose us to risk of liability to clients and the government and could cause delays in the introduction of new products and services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our products and services or cause harm to our reputation. If any of these events occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, our clients might use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation and lead to significant client relations problems.\nIf our products or services fail to provide accurate information, or if our content or any other element of our products or services is associated with incorrect, inaccurate or faulty coding, billing, or claims submissions to Medicare or any other third-party payor, we could be liable to clients or the government which could adversely affect our business.\nOur products and content were developed based on the laws, regulations and third-party payor rules in existence at the time such software and content was developed. If we interpret those laws, regulations or rules incorrectly; the laws, regulations or rules materially change at any point after the software and content was developed; we fail to provide up-to-date, accurate information; or our products, or services are otherwise associated with incorrect, inaccurate or faulty coding, billing or claims submissions, then clients could assert claims against us or the government or qui tam relators on behalf of the government could assert claims against us under the Federal False Claims Act or similar state laws. The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs to us, divert management\u2019s attention from operations, damage our reputation and decrease market acceptance of our services. We attempt to limit by contract our liability to clients for damages. We cannot, however, limit liability the government could seek to impose on us under the False Claims Act. Further, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable or otherwise protect us from liability for damages.\nOur information technology operations could be interrupted, which may adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe timely development, implementation and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network, applications, the Internet and other systems, including those which may be provided by third parties, are\nIndex to Financial Statements\nimportant facets in our delivery of products and services to our clients. Our ability to properly manage and protect these processes and systems is a key factor in continuing to offer our clients our full complement of products and services on time in an uninterrupted manner.\nOur operations, information technology and infrastructure are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a variety of sources, some of which are not within our control, including without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; (3) computer viruses and similar disruptive problems; (4) fire, flood and other natural disasters; and (5) cyber-security attacks on our network or damage to our software and systems carried out by hackers or Internet criminals, despite our security measures employed.\nSystem failures that interrupt our ability to develop applications or provide our products and services could affect our clients\u2019 perception of the value and security of our products and services. Delays or interruptions in the delivery of our products and services could result from many causes including hardware and software defects, insufficient capacity or the failure of our website hosting and telecommunications providers to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. Additionally, we host some of our services and serve our clients through third-party data center hosting facilities. We do not control the operation of these facilities. From time to time, we may need to relocate our data or our clients\u2019 data to alternative locations. Despite precautions taken during such moves, any difficulties experienced may impair the delivery of our services. We also depend on service providers that provide clients with access to our products and services. In addition, computer viruses or other attacks on our network and software may harm our systems causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation. In addition to potential liability, if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose clients. Any significant interruptions in our products and services could damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of confidential information provided to us by our clients or third parties, whether through breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business.\nThe difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information has been a significant issue when engaging in sensitive communications over the Internet. Our business relies on using the Internet to transmit confidential information. We believe that any well-publicized compromise of Internet security may deter companies from using the Internet for these purposes.\nOur services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our employees, subcontractors or third parties. If there were a disclosure of confidential information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the confidential information we possess, our operations could be seriously disrupted, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to claims pursuant to our agreements with our clients or other liabilities. In addition, if this were to occur, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability or regulatory action. While we maintain professional liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business, we cannot assure you that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A claim against us that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources.\nIndex to Financial Statements Risks Related to Government Regulation\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. Any material changes in the political, economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affect the group purchasing business or the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations, or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry, could require us to modify our services or reduce the funds available to providers to purchase our products and services.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly. Our ability to grow will depend upon the economic environment of the healthcare industry generally as well as our ability to increase the number of programs and services that we sell to our clients. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses; consolidation in the healthcare industry; regulation; litigation; and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices, operations and the financial health of healthcare organizations. In particular, changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry, such as increased regulation of the purchase and sale of medical products, or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements, could require us to make unplanned modifications to our products and services, result in delays or cancellations of orders, or reduce funds and demand for our products and services.\nCash flow and access to credit continue to be problematic for many healthcare delivery organizations. While we believe we are well positioned through our product and service offerings to assist hospitals and health systems who are dealing with intense and increasing financial pressures, it is unclear what long-term effects these conditions will have on the healthcare industry and in turn on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2009 the United States Congress enacted the Heath Information Technology for Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among other things, the HITECH Act provides incentives for certain physicians and hospitals related to the adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records (\u201cEHRs\u201d). The Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) continues to issue regulations to implement these requirements in stages. Meeting the requirements for such incentives may require additional investment in clinical information systems. While we believe that increased emphasis on EHRs by hospitals and health systems will also drive demand for SaaS-based tools, such as ours, to help rationalize and standardize patient and clinical data for efficient and accurate use, we cannot be certain of the extent or financial impact from such demand.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d), amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control health care spending, and improve health care quality. The law includes provisions to tie Medicare provider reimbursement to health care quality and incentives; Medicare health care delivery reforms; mandatory compliance programs; enhanced transparency disclosure requirements; increased funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse; and incentives to state Medicaid programs to promote community-based care as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. In addition, the law provides for the establishment of a national voluntary pilot program to bundle Medicare payments for hospital and post-acute services, which could lead to changes in the delivery of health care services. Likewise, many states have adopted or are considering changes in health care policies in part due to state budgetary shortfalls. While many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have begun to be implemented, we do not know what long-term effect the federal Affordable Care Act or other future changes to federal or state laws may have on our business.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by subsequent legislation, established a budget process known as sequestration that imposes across-the-board federal spending cuts (with certain exceptions) to meet budget targets. Under this process, a two percent reduction to Medicare provider and plan payments has been in effect\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsince April 1, 2013, and this reduction will continue through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken to achieve alternative budget savings or otherwise modify the terms of sequestration. There can be no assurances that reimbursement reductions under sequestration or alternative federal or state budgetary actions will not have an adverse impact on our clients and in turn our business.\nIf current or future government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, and other material limitations on our business.\nMost of the products offered through our group purchasing contracts are subject to direct regulation by federal and state governmental agencies. We rely upon vendors who use our services to meet all quality control, packaging, distribution, labeling, hazard and health information notice, record keeping and licensing requirements. In addition, we rely upon the carriers retained by our vendors to comply with regulations regarding the shipment of any hazardous materials.\nWe cannot guarantee that the vendors are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If vendors or the providers with whom we do business have failed, or fail in the future, to adequately comply with relevant laws or regulations, we could become involved in governmental investigations or private lawsuits concerning these regulations. If we were found to be legally responsible in any way for such failure we could be subject to injunctions, penalties or fines which could harm our business. Furthermore, any such investigation or lawsuit could cause us to expend significant resources and divert the attention of our management team, regardless of the outcome, and thus could harm our business.\nThe group purchasing industry and some of its largest purchasing clients have been reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights for possible conflict of interest and restraint of trade violations. As a response to the Senate Subcommittee inquiry, our company joined other GPOs to develop a set of voluntary principles of ethics and business conduct designed to address concerns regarding anti-competitive practices. The voluntary code was presented to the Senate Subcommittee in March 2006. In addition, we maintain our own Standards of Business Conduct that provide guidelines for conducting our business practices in a manner that is consistent with antitrust and restraint of trade laws and regulations. There has not been any further inquiry by the Senate Subcommittee since March 2006. On August 11, 2009, we, and several other GPOs, received a letter from Senators Charles Grassley, Herb Kohl and Bill Nelson requesting information concerning the different relationships between and among our GPO and its clients, distributors, manufacturers and other vendors and suppliers, and requesting certain information about the services the GPO performs and the payments it receives. On September 25, 2009, we and several other GPOs received a request for information from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), also concerning our GPO\u2019s services and relationships with our clients. Subsequently, we, and other GPOs, received follow-up requests for additional information. We fully complied with all of these requests. On September 27, 2010, the GAO released a report titled \u201cGroup Purchasing Organizations - Services Provided to Customers and Initiatives Regarding Their Business Practices\u201d. On that same day, the Minority Staff of the Senate Finance Committee released a report titled \u201cEmpirical Data Lacking to Support Claims of Savings with Group Purchasing Organizations\u201d. On April 30, 2012, the GAO released another report, titled \u201cGroup Purchasing Organizations - Federal Oversight and Self-Regulation\u201d, addressing federal oversight practices with respect to GPOs. On November 24, 2014, the GAO released another report, titled \u201cGroup Purchasing Organizations - Funding Structure Has Potential Implications for Medicare Costs,\u201d addressing GPO contracting practices and funding structures and their potential impact on the Medicare program.\nCongress, HHS, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or another state or federal entity could at any time open a new investigation of the group purchasing industry, or develop new rules, regulations or laws governing the industry, that could adversely impact our ability to negotiate pricing arrangements with vendors, increase reporting and documentation requirements, or otherwise require us to modify our arrangements in a manner that adversely impacts our business and financial results. We may also face private or government\nIndex to Financial Statements\nlawsuits alleging violations arising from the concerns articulated by these governmental actors. We are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, which from time to time may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders, employees or injured persons, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation outcomes could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur clients are highly dependent on payments from third-party healthcare payors, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs, and reductions or changes in third-party reimbursement could adversely affect our clients and consequently our business.\nOur clients derive a substantial portion of their revenue from third-party private and governmental payors, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. Our sales and profitability depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage of and reimbursement for the products our clients purchase or otherwise obtain through us is available from governmental health programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other third-party payors. These third-party payors exercise significant control over, and increasingly use their enhanced bargaining power to secure, discounted reimbursement rates and impose other requirements that may adversely impact our clients\u2019 ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for products and services they purchase or otherwise obtain through us as a group purchasing member.\nIf third-party payors do not approve products for reimbursement or fail to reimburse for them adequately, our clients may suffer adverse financial consequences which, in turn, may reduce the demand for and ability to purchase our products or services. In addition, pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid statutes, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to report certain pricing data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), which is the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs. CMS uses this data to determine manufacturer rebate liabilities and to establish reimbursement limits for certain drugs under Medicare and Medicaid. CMS has issued final rules governing Medicare \u201caverage sales price\u201d calculations and has published proposed rules governing Medicaid pricing calculations. Both the final and proposed rules include provisions that allow manufacturers to exclude \u201cbona fide service fees\u201d meeting certain standards from their pricing calculations, and CMS guidance has indicated that administrative fees paid by drug manufacturers to GPOs may qualify as bona fide service fees. There can be no assurance (i) that any pharmaceutical manufacturer will treat GPO fees paid to the Company as bona fide service fees or that CMS or other government agencies will agree with the manufacturer\u2019s treatment of such fees, (ii) that CMS will continue to allow exclusion of GPO administrative fees meeting the bona fide service fee standards from Medicare pricing calculations or will adopt such an exclusion in a Medicaid final rule, or (iii) that, in the absence of any other basis for excluding such fees from government pricing calculations, any reimbursement limitations resulting from manufacturers\u2019 reported pricing data, or other efforts by payors to limit reimbursement, will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state laws governing submission of false or fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs and financial relationships among healthcare providers, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect patients, governmental healthcare programs, and private health plans from fraudulent and abusive activities. These laws include anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims. These laws are complex and their application to our specific products, services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have recently increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules. From time to time we and others in the healthcare industry have received inquiries or subpoenas to produce documents in connection with such activities. We could be required to expend significant time and resources to comply with these requests, and the attention of our management team could be diverted to these efforts. Furthermore, if we are found to be in violation of any federal or state fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in federal\nIndex to Financial Statements\nand state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition.\nProvisions in Title XI of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to induce referrals which are applicable to all patients regardless of whether the patient is covered under a governmental health program or private health plan. We attempt to scrutinize our business relationships and activities to comply with the federal anti-kickback statute and similar laws; and we attempt to structure our sales and group purchasing arrangements in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of applicable safe harbors to these laws. We cannot assure you, however, that our arrangements will be protected by such safe harbors or that such increased enforcement activities will not directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations. Any determination by a state or federal agency that any of our activities or those of our vendors or clients violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties; could require us to change or terminate some portions of or operations or business, or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs; and, thus could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business, particularly our Revenue Cycle Management segment, is also subject to numerous federal and state laws that forbid the submission or \u201ccausing the submission\u201d of false or fraudulent information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement to Medicare, Medicaid, federal healthcare programs or private health plans. These laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Errors created by our products or consulting services that relate to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim or cost report information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Any failure of our products or services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal liability; could adversely affect demand for our services; could invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts; could require us to change or terminate some portions of our business; could require us to refund portions of our services fees; could cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payors; and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFederal and state privacy and security laws may increase the costs of operation and expose us to civil and criminal sanctions.\nWe must comply with extensive federal and state requirements regarding the use, disclosure, retention and security of patient healthcare information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, as amended by the regulations promulgated pursuant to the HITECH Act, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals\u2019 protected health information. These restrictions and requirements are set forth in the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules. The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual\u2019s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is subject to the terms of a business associate agreement; is authorized by the individual; or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule imposes a complex set of requirements on covered entities for complying with this basic standard. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information created, received, maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf. The Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities to report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and, in some circumstances, the media.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our healthcare provider clients that engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, and our own business operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, are directly subject to the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules governing \u201ccovered entities.\u201d Additionally, because some of our clients are covered entities who disclose protected health information to us so that we may use that information to provide certain consulting or other services to those clients, we are a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of those clients. In these cases, in order to provide clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients. Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:\n\u2022\nas to how we will use and disclose the protected health information;\n\u2022\nthat we will implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;\n\u2022\nthat we will enter into agreements with our subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit the information on our behalf that impose the same restrictions and conditions that apply to us with respect to such information;\n\u2022\nthat we will report breaches of unsecured protected health information, security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and\n\u2022\nthat we will assist the covered entity with certain of its duties under the Privacy Rule.\nOn January 25, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of HHS published a major final rule modifying the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification and Enforcement Rules, including revisions and changes made pursuant to the HITECH Act. Among other things, this rule expanded the security and certain privacy requirements for business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information for or on behalf of covered entities, increased penalties for noncompliance, and strengthened requirements for reporting of breaches of unsecured protected health information. The rule also made business associates and their subcontractors directly liable for civil monetary penalties for impermissible uses and disclosures of protected health information. The rule went into effect March 23, 2013, and as a covered entity and business associate we were, with limited exceptions, required to comply with the applicable requirements of this final rule by September 23, 2013.\nAny failure or perceived failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA standards and related regulatory requirements could expose us to certain notification, penalty and/or enforcement risks and could adversely affect demand for our products and services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our clients and HIPAA.\nIn addition to our obligations under HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. These state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them as well.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other federal or state laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the associated costs of compliance. For example, the federal Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (\u201cONCHIT\u201d) is coordinating the development of national standards for creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure based on the widespread adoption of EHRs in the healthcare sector. Several organizations, selected as ONCHIT-Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies (\u201cATCBs\u201d) for EHR certification, test and certify that EHR products are compliant with the standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services. Certified EHR technologies are eligible to be used for the CMS EHR Incentive Programs. The regulatory standards for these technologies have been evolving. We are yet unable to predict what, if any, impact the development and ongoing refinement of such standards and related ONCHIT activities will have on our products, services or compliance costs.\nIndex to Financial Statements Failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, and data security may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and in some circumstances, criminal penalties. In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients.\nHIPAA and its implementing regulations also mandate format, data content and provider identifier standards that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. Although our systems are fully capable of transmitting transactions that comply with these requirements, some payers and healthcare clearinghouses with which we conduct business may interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do or may require us to use legacy formats or include legacy identifiers as they make the transition to full compliance. In cases where payers or healthcare clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations or require us to accommodate legacy transactions or identifiers as a condition of successful transactions, we attempt to comply with their requirements, but may be subject to enforcement actions as a result. In January 2009, CMS published a final rule adopting updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. A separate final rule also published by CMS in January 2009 resulted in changes to the formats to be used for electronic transactions subject to the ICD-10 code sets, known as Version 5010. Healthcare providers were required to comply with Version 5010 by January 1, 2012 (although CMS provided a temporary enforcement discretion period ending June 30, 2012). In 2012, the compliance date for ICD-10 was delayed until October 1, 2014 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 prevents the adoption of ICD-10 prior to October 1, 2015. An August 4, 2014 HHS rule establishes the ICD-10 compliance date as October 1, 2015. We are actively working to make the proper modifications in preparation for the implementation of ICD-10. We may not be successful in responding to these changes and any changes in response that we make to our transactions and software may result in errors or otherwise negatively impact our service levels. We may also experience complications in supporting clients that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance date.\nIf our clients who operate as not-for profit entities lose their tax-exempt status, those clients would suffer significant adverse tax consequences which, in turn, could adversely impact their ability to purchase products or services from us.\nState tax authorities have challenged the tax-exempt status of hospitals and other healthcare facilities claiming such status on the basis that they are operating as charitable and/or religious organizations. The outcome of these cases has been mixed with some facilities retaining their tax-exempt status while others have been denied the ability to continue operating as not-for profit, tax-exempt entities under state law. In addition, many states have removed sales tax exemptions previously available to not-for-profit entities, and both the IRS and the United States Congress are investigating the practices of non-for profit hospitals. The Affordable Care Act added new requirements for hospitals operating as charitable organizations, which the IRS has been implementing through regulations. Those facilities denied tax exemptions could be subject to the imposition of tax penalties and assessments which could have a material adverse impact on their cash flow, financial strength and possibly ongoing viability. If the tax exempt status of any of our clients is revoked or compromised by new legislation, regulation, or interpretation of existing legislation or regulation, that client\u2019s financial health could be adversely affected, which could adversely impact our sales and revenue.\nRisks Related to Ownership in Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our\nIndex to Financial Statements\ncommon stock could fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described above and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC and announcements of mergers and acquisitions, technological innovations or new products or services by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nany major change in our senior management team;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally; and\n\u2022\nour quarterly results of operations or future financial projections falling below the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nYou may not be able to resell your shares at or above the market price you paid to purchase your shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in the market as a whole or our operating performance or prospects.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nFor example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with approximately a third of the directors coming up for re-election each year. Having a staggered board could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us through a proxy contest. Other provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or changes in management include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of, including voting, dividend and other special rights, and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years from the time such person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner or an exception to such restriction applies.\nIndex to Financial Statements A change of control may also impact employee benefit arrangements, which could make an acquisition more costly and could prevent it from going forward. For example, our equity compensation plans allow for all or a portion of the equity granted under these plans to vest upon a change of control and subsequent employee termination. Finally, upon any change in control, the lenders under our credit facilities would have the right to require us to repay all of the outstanding obligations under our credit facilities and the noteholders under our indenture would have the right to require that we offer to redeem the notes thereunder at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and all other amounts payable thereunder.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 92464, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "MDAS"}
