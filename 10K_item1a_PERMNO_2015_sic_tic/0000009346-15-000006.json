RISK FACTORS\n\u00b7\nThe Company operates in the Property and Casualty insurance industry where many of its competitors are larger with far greater resources. Further, this industry is heavily regulated. Changes in laws and regulations governing the insurance industry could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to generate income from its insurance operations. The Company\u2019s Insurance Subsidiaries, as a group, are regulated and licensed in all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, all Canadian provinces, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. The Company is obliged to comply with numerous complex and varied governmental regulations in order to maintain its authority to write insurance business. Failure to maintain compliance could result in various governmental regulators preventing the Company from writing new business and therefore having a material impact on the Company. Further, the ability for the Company\u2019s Insurance Subsidiaries to adjust insurance rates is regulated for significant portions of the Company\u2019s business and needed rate adjustments can be denied or delayed for substantial periods by regulators.\n\u00b7\nThe Company has two classes of common stock with unequal voting rights. The Company is effectively controlled by its principal stockholders and management, which limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence operations. The Company\u2019s executive officers, directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates control approximately 64% of the outstanding shares of voting Class A common stock and nearly 32% of the outstanding shares of non-voting Class B common stock. These parties effectively control the Company, direct its affairs, and exert significant influence in the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders may conflict with those of other stockholders, limit marketability of the stock and this concentration of voting power has the potential to delay, defer or prevent a change in control.\n\u00b7\nThe Company limits its risk of loss from policies of insurance issued by its Insurance Subsidiaries through the purchase of reinsurance coverage from other insurance companies. Such reinsurance does not relieve the Company from its responsibility to policyholders should the reinsurers be unable to meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the underlying reinsurance agreements. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. While the Company has not experienced any significant reinsurance losses for over twenty five years, a small number of our less significant historical reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. If the Company is unable to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers, the resultant credit losses would adversely affect its results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength.\n\u00b7\nOperating in the Property and Casualty insurance industry, the Company is exposed to loss from policies of insurance issued to its policyholders. A large portion of the provision for losses recorded by the Company is composed of estimates of future loss payments to be made. Such estimates of future loss payments may prove to be inadequate. Loss and loss expense reserves represent management\u2019s best estimate at a given point in time but are not an exact calculation of ultimate liability. Rather, they are complex estimates derived by utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on management\u2019s part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called \u201clong tail\u201d lines where the adjudication of claims can take many years, management is sometimes required to revise reserves. This results in a charge to the Company\u2019s earnings in the amount of the adjusted reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can potentially have a material impact, either positively or negatively, on calendar year results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\u00b7\nWhile much less significant in the past few years, a meaningful portion of the risk underwritten by the Insurance Subsidiaries covers property losses resulting from catastrophic events on a worldwide basis. The occurrence and valuation of loss events for this business is highly unpredictable and a single catastrophic event could result in a materially significant loss to the Company. Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather, and fires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophic losses generally, it can take many months, or even years, for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined. As our claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, management may be required to adjust recorded reserves to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims. While the eventual occurrence of catastrophic losses is expected, we are prohibited by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles from establishing reserves for the expected future occurrence of these losses (such as is done in the life insurance industry). Accordingly, upon the occurrence of such a loss, it will likely have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations in the quarter in which it occurs.\n- 18 -\n\u00b7\nThe Company derives a significant percentage of its direct premium volume from FedEx Ground Systems, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities (\u201cFedEx\u201d), and from insurance coverage provided to independent service providers under contract with FedEx. While the loss of this major customer could severely reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings potential, insurance programs provided to FedEx and programs provided to the independent service providers under contract with FedEx are not necessarily dependent upon one another and, therefore, could be viewed as separate entities.\n\u00b7\nThe Company, through its Insurance Subsidiaries, requires collateral from its insureds covering the insureds\u2019 obligations for self-insured retentions or deductibles related to policies of insurance provided. Should the Company, as surety, become responsible for such insured obligations, the collateral held may prove to be insufficient. In this regard, FedEx utilize significant self-insured retentions and deductibles under policies of insurance provided by the Company\u2019s Insurance Subsidiaries. In the case of FedEx, the Company has determined that the financial strength of the customer is sufficient to allow for holding only partial collateral at this time. Should the Company become responsible for this entire customer\u2019s self-insured retention and deductible obligations, the collateral held would be insufficient and the Company would sustain a significant operating loss.\n\u00b7\nGiven the Company\u2019s significant interest-bearing investment portfolio, a material drop in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s earnings and financial position. Conversely, a material increase in interest rates could have a significant temporary impact on the market value of the Company\u2019s fixed maturity investment portfolio. The functioning of the fixed income markets, the values of the investments the Company holds and the Company\u2019s ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted by a change in interest rates or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, wars, or terrorist attacks; a recession, depression, or other adverse developments in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in the Company\u2019s portfolio; financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, which could further disrupt the markets; inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact the Company\u2019s ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired; a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation. If the fixed-income portfolio were to suffer a decrease in value to a substantial degree, the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, the Company\u2019s income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce the Company\u2019s results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength.\n\u00b7\nThe Company has a large portfolio of equity securities and limited partnership investments which can fluctuate in value with a wide variety of market conditions. A decline in the aggregate value of the equity securities and limited partnership investments would result in a commensurate decline in the Company\u2019s shareholders equity, either through the income statement or directly to equity. The resultant decline could, at least temporarily, materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength.\n- 19 -\n\u00b7\nTechnological advances in the transportation industry could present the Company with added competitive risks. An increase in accident prevention technologies and the growth of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles could reduce the amount of accidents over time and shift the liability from the owner of the vehicle to the manufacturer, which would cause automobile insurance to become a smaller portion of the Company\u2019s overall Property and Casualty insurance book of business. Innovations in telematics and the increase in usage-based information have become more important and will likely change the way premiums are determined in the future. These advances in technology could materially change the way products in the transportation industry are designed, priced and underwritten and it will take time for the Company to adjust to these changes.\n\u00b7\nChanges in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact the Company\u2019s reported financial results. Developments in accounting practices may require the Company to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if the Company is required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, net equity and other historical financial statement line items that are important to users of the financial statements. Changes could also introduce significant volatility in the Company\u2019s results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely upon complex and expensive information technology systems for interacting with policyholders, brokers and employers. The Company\u2019s success involves providing customers with easy-to-use products and ensuring the Company\u2019s workforce has the technology to support the customer base. The pace at which information systems must be upgraded is continually increasing, requiring an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards. The Company\u2019s success is reliant on developing and expanding the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to enhance information systems that support the Company\u2019s operations in a cost effective manner.\n\u00b7\nThe Company relies upon the information technology systems and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data to run the businesses and service the customers. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, the information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers, or in theft of intellectual property or proprietary information. A failure to maintain proper security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems could delay or disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to do business and service customers, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, subject the Company to litigation, regulatory fines, a loss of customers and revenues or otherwise adversely affect the business.", "PERMNO": 16417, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PTVCB"}
