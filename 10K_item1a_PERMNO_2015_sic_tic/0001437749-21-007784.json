{"cik": "1004989", "company": "SPAR Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in SGRP's common stock (\"SGRP Common Stock\") involves a high degree of risk and is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, cautions, circumstances and other factors (\"Risks\") that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected or otherwise expected in any forward-looking statements or other information (see Forward-Looking Statements immediately preceding Part I, above).\nYou should carefully review and consider the following Risks as well as those made, contained or noted in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, the Proxy Statement or other applicable SEC Report, but you should not place undue reliance on any of them. All forward-looking statements and other information attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly subject to and qualified by all such Risks.\nThose Risks reflect our expectations, views and assumptions only as of the date of this Annual Report, and the Company does not intend, assume any obligation, or promise to publicly update or revise any such Risk or information (in whole or in part), whether as a result of new information, new or worsening Risks or uncertainties, changed circumstances, future events, recognition, or otherwise.\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of Coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s financial condition and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce.\nIn 2020, many of our clients were impacted by temporary retail closures, reduced in-store hours, in-store customer limits and product shipping delays. As a result, the Company implemented several cost savings measures which included a reduction in the use of contracted workers, furloughing employees, reducing hours and a reduction in other corporate and non-critical expenses.\nGiven the continued COVID-19 outbreak, the global responses to curb its spread and the distribution of vaccines, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic. However, many of our clients whose business was shut down or reduced capacity earlier in 2020 have returned to normal operations, and the overall business has improved as the fiscal year of 2020 ended. We do not anticipate a continual material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe markets we operate in are cyclical and subject to the effects of economic downturns.\nThe markets in which the Company operates are cyclical and subject to the effects of economic downturns. The current political, social and economic conditions, including the impact of terrorism and COVID-19 on consumer and business behavior, make it difficult for the Company, its vendors and its clients to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Substantially all of the Company's key clients are either retailers, manufacturers or those seeking to do product merchandising at retailers. Should the retail or manufacturing industries experience a significant economic downturn, the resultant reduction in product sales could significantly decrease the Company's revenues. The Company also has risks associated with its clients changing their business plans and/or reducing their marketing budgets in response to economic conditions, which could also significantly decrease the Company's revenues. Such revenue decreases could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nWe can be adversely affected if governments pass legislation that mandates an increase in wages, changes labor laws or otherwise drives market behavior that negatively impacts the business or operations of SPAR Group or our clients.\nBecause the Company has operations in 10 distinct countries and relies on independent contractors as well as other third-party providers to perform work, there is risk that any government legislation that restricts travel, changes labor laws, impacts wages or otherwise incentivizes behavior that negatively impacts our business or our clients, could impact our business.\nThe continued legislative trend to increase minimum wages is one of these risks. The minimum wage in states, cities and municipalities in the United States has been steadily increasing over the last several years. A similar risk is the trend of legislatures and courts to apply those minimum wages and other benefits to ever increasing pools of workers. We monitor these increases and trends and plan for future known changes as we manage our business and establish agreements with clients.\nThe Company continues to analyze various aspects of potential business impact driven by any legislation in all of the countries we operate. While we do not foresee any material impact in the short-term, the Company will continue to monitor and manage the business accordingly.\nOur business depends on variable client projects that can shift from period to period, be delayed, be canceled or otherwise require us to assume higher costs to perform the work.\nThe Company has experienced and, in the future, may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results and cash flow. Factors that may cause the Company's quarterly operating results and cash flow to vary from time to time and may result in reduced revenue and profits include: (i) the number of active client projects; (ii) seasonality of client products; (iii) client delays, changes and cancellations in projects; (iv) staffing requirements, indemnifications, risk allocations, primary insurance coverages, intellectual property claims, and other contractual provisions and concessions demanded by clients that are unilateral, unreasonable and very time consuming to review and attempt to negotiate; (v) the timing requirements of client projects; (vi) the completion of major client projects; (vii) the timing of new engagements; (viii) the timing of personnel cost increases; (ix) service locations and conditions with higher than contemplated personnel costs (remote areas, higher minimum wages, higher skill sets required, etc.); and (x) the loss of major clients. In addition, the Company is subject to revenue or profit uncertainties resulting from factors such as unprofitable client work and the failure of clients to pay. These revenue fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected if retailers and manufacturers elect to perform merchandising and marketing services with their own resources or if they have less stores that need our services.\nThe business and growth of the Company depends in part on the continued outsourcing of merchandising and marketing services, which the Company believes has increased from the consolidation of retailers and manufacturers, as well as the desire to seek outsourcing specialists to reduce fixed operation expenses and concentrate internal staff on customer service and sales. There can be no assurance that this outsourcing will continue, as companies may elect to perform such services internally.\nIn addition, retailers with physical store locations are facing increasing consolidation and competition from eCommerce/virtual stores. The Company's business and growth depends in part on the continuing need for in-store merchandising of products and the continuing success of retailers with physical store locations. There can be no assurance that the in-store merchandising of products will increase or even continue at current levels or that retailers with physical store locations will continue to compete successfully in those stores, and some retailers are shifting their sales focus to their virtual online stores.\nA significant decrease in such need for in-store merchandising or success of such physical stores could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nWe do work with furniture and other related assembly services at stores, in homes and in offices.\nThe Company's technicians assemble furniture and other products in the stores, homes and offices of customers. Working at a customer's store, home or office could give rise to claims against the Company for errors, omissions or misconduct by those technicians, including (without limitation) harassment, personal injury, death, damage to or theft of customer property, or other civil or criminal misconduct by such technicians. Claims also could be made against the Company as a result of its involvement in such assembly services due to (among other things) product assembly errors and omissions, product defects, deficiencies, breakdowns or collapse, products that are not merchantable or fit for their particular purpose, products that do not conform to published specifications or satisfy customer expectations, or products that cause personal injury, death or property damage, in each case whether actual, alleged or perceived by customers, and irrespective of how much time may have passed since such assembly. If such claims are asserted and adversely determined against the Company, then to the extent such claims are not covered by indemnification from the product's seller or manufacturer or by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nWe depend upon third-party independent contractors and the services they provide.\nThe success of the Company's domestic business is dependent upon the successful execution and administration of its domestic field services through the services of field merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a \"Field Specialist\"), and a significant portion of them are provided to the Company and are engaged by the Independent Field Vendor and located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically through the services of local, regional, district and other personnel (each a \"Field Administrator\"). The inability to identify, engage and successfully administer its domestic field services through qualified Field Specialists and Field Administrators could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or conditions), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nA significant portion of the services of the Field Specialists provided to the Company are supplied by the Independent Field Vendor. It is possible that the appropriateness of the treatment of those Field Specialists as independent contractors by the Independent Field Vendor will be periodically subject to legal review or challenge by various states and others. The Company in its discretion may review and decide each request by its Independent Field Vendor for reimbursement of its legal defense expenses on a case-by-case basis, including the relative costs and benefits to the Company of doing so, but such Independent Field Vendor has agreed that the Company has no obligation to do so.\nTo the Company's knowledge, its Independent Field Vendor is not involved in any material proceeding involving its independent contractors. However: (i) if the Company approves its reimbursement of any material legal defense costs of the Independent Field Vendor; or (ii) if the Company somehow becomes liable for any legal expenses incurred by the Independent Field Vendor, any related party or any third party in defending any claim or satisfying any judgment against such parties; or (iii) if the Company somehow becomes liable through any judicial determination for any judgment against the Independent Field Vendor, the Independent Field Administrator, or any related party or other vendor or service provider (in whole or in part); or (iv) if any such proceeding or matter causes: (A) any decrease in the Independent Field Administrator's or the Independent Field Vendor's performance (quality or otherwise); (B) any inability by the Independent Field Administrator or the Independent Field Vendor to execute the services for the Company or to continue with its present business model; or (C) any increase in the Company's use of employees (rather than independent contractors) as its domestic Field Specialists; then any of the foregoing, in whole or in part, could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nAdditionally, the Company believes that its business model of executing a significant portion of its services domestically (other than in California, where the Company is using its own employees) through independent contractors provided by others is equally effective but inherently less costly than doing so with employees, both under applicable tax and employment laws and otherwise. However, the Company continues to reevaluate its business model of using third party independent contractors as Field Specialists outside of California in light of changing client requirements and legal and regulatory environments.\nWe rely on our systems and third-party vendors.\nThe Company relies on its proprietary systems for (among other things) the scheduling, tracking, coordination and reporting of its merchandising and marketing services. In addition to proprietary software and applications of the Company, the systems use and rely upon software (including operating system, office, exchange, data base and server programs) licensed and hardware purchased or leased from third parties and telecommunication services provided by third parties, which third-party software, hardware and telecommunication services may not continue to be available at all or (if available) with the necessary access, uptime, speeds or bandwidth, at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms. Any defect, error or other performance failure in such third-party software, hardware or service also could result in a defect, error or performance failure in our client services. Systems can experience excess traffic and related inefficiencies, from increased demand or otherwise, as well as increased cyberattacks by hackers and other saboteurs. To the extent that systems experience increased demands on current capacity and for additional capacity from (among other things) an increase in the numbers of users, frequency or duration of use, bandwidth requirements of software, applications and users (including the increasing demand from the Company's clients for data-intensive as-serviced pictures from the Field Specialists), or cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that the Company's technological systems and third-party software, hardware and telecommunication providers will continue to be able to support the demands placed on them by such increased demand or negative events.\nThe Company relies on third-party vendors to provide its telecommunication network access and other services used in its business, and the Company has no control over such third-party providers. Additionally, a cybersecurity breach that results in unauthorized access to sensitive consumer or corporate information contained in these systems may adversely affect the Company's reputation and lead to claims against it. Such claims could include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims and claims related to violations of applicable data privacy laws. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to the Company's operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to the Company's data, or results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to the Company's reputation, affect its relationships with its customers, lead to claims against it and ultimately harm its business. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nAny such software, hardware or service unavailability or unreasonable pricing or terms, defect, error or other performance failure in such third-party software, hardware or service, increased capacity demands, disruption in services, security breach or protective measures could increase the Company's costs of operation and reduce its efficiency and performance, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur stock is subject to volatility and general market risk.\nThe market price of SGRP Common Stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the sale price of SGRP Common Stock fluctuated from $0.55 to $1.35 per share. The Company believes that its Common Stock is subject to wide price fluctuations due to (among other things) the following:\n\u25cf\nThe relatively small public float and corresponding thin trading market for SGRP Common Stock, attributable to (among other things) the large block of voting shares beneficially owned by the Company's co-founders (as noted below) and generally low trading volumes, and that thin trading market may cause small trades to have significant impacts on SGRP Common Stock price.\n\u25cf\nThe substantial beneficial ownership of the Company's voting stock and potential control by Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels and related parties (See Risks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders: Potential Voting Control and Conflicts, above, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions Domestic Related Party Services, and Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters, below).\n\u25cf\nThe periodic potential risk of the delisting of SGRP Common Stock from trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") (as described below).\n\u25cf\nAny announcement, estimate or disclosure by the Company, or any projection or other claim or pronouncement by any of the Company's competitors or any financial analyst, commentator, blogger or other person, respecting: (i) any new service created or improved, significant contract, business acquisition or relationship, or other publicized development by the Company or any of its competitors; or (ii) any change, fluctuation or other development in the Company's actual, estimated or desired affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition or in those of any of the Company's competitors, in each case irrespective of accuracy or validity and whether or not adverse or material.\n\u25cf\nThe general volatility of stock markets, consumer and investor confidence, and the general state of the economy (which often affect the prices of stock issued by the Company and many others without regard to financial results or condition).\nIf the Company issues (other than at fair market value for cash) or the Majority Stockholders sell a large number of shares of SGRP Common Stock, or if the market perceives such an issuance or sale is likely or imminent, the market price of SGRP Common Stock could decline and that decline could be significant.\nThe Company also has repurchased SGRP Common Stock from time to time, and currently has in place a Repurchase Program (as defined and described in Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, below). Those repurchases could adversely affect the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock.\nIn addition, the volatility in the market price of SGRP Common Stock could lead to class action securities litigation that could in turn impose substantial costs on the Company, divert management's attention and resources from the day-to-day operations of the Company's business and harm the Company's stock price, the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nAs a small company with stock price volatility, our stock may be de-listed from NASDAQ.\nSGRP received a notification letter from Nasdaq dated April 23, 2020 (the \"Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter\"), stating that SGRP had failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for shares of the SGRP Common Stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days preceding the Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter (i.e., March 11, 2020 - April 22, 2020) as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule\"). The Nasdaq Bid Price Deficiency Letter provided that SGRP had until December 28, 2020 as a grace period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by maintaining a closing bid price of $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. On December 28, 2020, Nasdaq sent SGRP a letter stating in part that SGRP had regained compliance during the extended grace period with Nasdaq's minimum Bid Price Rule and that such matter was closed.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply in the future with Nasdaq's Board Independence Rule, Audit Committee Composition Rule, Bid Price Rule or other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. See Risks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders and Potential Voting Control and Conflicts, above. If the Company fails to satisfy the applicable continued listing requirement again in the future, Nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against the Company (during which the Company may have additional time of up to six months to appeal and correct its non-compliance). If the SGRP Common Stock shares were ultimately delisted by Nasdaq, trading of the SGRP Common Stock could be limited to \"over-the-counter\" trades and the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock could be adversely affected, which could result in a decrease in the market price of the SGRP Common Stock due to (among other things) the potential for increased spreads between bids and asks, lower trading volumes and reporting delays in over-the-counter trades and the negative implications and perceptions that could arise from such a delisting. See also Item 9B -- Other Information -- Failure to Maintain a Majority of Independent Directors on the Board, below.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if the SGRP Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is traded on the over-the-counter market, the \"penny stock\" rules, if applicable, could adversely affect the market price of the SGRP Common Stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted specific rules regulating \"penny stock\", including additional risk disclosure requirements by broker dealers. If applicable in the future, the penny stock rules may also restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the SGRP Common Stock and may adversely affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nWe have inherent risk of failure to maintain effective internal controls.\nEstablishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosures are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial and other reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted and applicable securities and other law in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial and other reporting are not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company could prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or other reports or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial and disclosure reporting could limit the Company's ability to report its financial results and file its other reports accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial or disclosure reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial or other reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and a decline in the market price of the SGRP Common Stock. See also Risks of Having Material Local Investors and Local Executives in International and Domestic Subsidiaries, below.\nOur business is dependent on client payments, business performance and broad economic shifts, and we may be at risk of liquidity constraints and not satisfying all of our credit facility covenants.\nOur business and cash flow can be adversely affected by adverse changes in our client payments, our business performance and broad economic shifts. There can be no assurances that in the future the Company will not violate covenants of its current or future credit facilities; and if it does violate them, that the Company's lenders will waive any violations of such covenants affecting the Company's ability to maintain adequate lines of credit or sufficient availability under its lines of credit. Accordingly, minimal profitability by the Company, additional one-time charges, and changes in the composition and quality of its borrowing base, as well as any failure to maintain sufficient availability or lines of credit from the Company's lenders (which may involve their subjective judgement), could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition, whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur business and stock liquidity and market value could be adversely affected if we settle outstanding litigation by making payments or issuing common stock.\nThe timing, size and success of litigation settlement efforts and any associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. Future litigation settlements may be financed by issuing shares of the SGRP Common Stock, cash, or a combination thereof. If the SGRP Common Stock does not maintain a sufficient market value, or if potential litigants are otherwise unwilling to accept the SGRP Common Stock as part of the consideration for the settlement of their litigation, the Company may be required to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. To the extent the SGRP Common Stock is used for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for legal settlements, dilution may be experienced by existing stockholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing it may need for litigation settlements on terms that the Company deems acceptable. Failure to obtain such capital would materially and adversely affect the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected. There also can be no assurance that the other parties in any settlement will abide by the terms or any settlement or any related releases. See SBS Bankruptcy, Settlement and March 2020 Claim in Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies, below.\nWe no longer have contracts with former affiliated companies SPAR Business Services and SPAR Administrative Services, but they continue to make payment demands and may be subject to litigation that attempts to include the Company as a defendant.\nThe Company formally engaged SPAR Business Services, Inc. (\"SBS\"), the Company's affiliate, and SBS provided substantially all of the services of the Field Specialists to the Company prior to SBS' termination by the Company in July 2018. Additionally, the Company formerly engaged SPAR Administrative Services, Inc. (\"SAS\"), an affiliate of SBS, to provide Field Administrator services. SBS is beneficially owned by Robert. G. Brown and prior to the SBS Chapter 11 also was owned in part by William H. Bartels. SAS is beneficially owned by William H. Bartels and family members of Robert. G. Brown. See Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services and Disputes, below.\nThe appropriateness of SBS' treatment of its Field Specialists as independent contractors had been periodically subject to legal review or challenge (both currently and historically) by various states and others. The Company is not obligated or liable, and the Company has not otherwise agreed and does not currently intend, to reimburse SBS for any judgment or any other amount in any such legal review, challenge or other proceeding against or involving SBS.\nEven though SBS was solely responsible for its operations, methods and legal compliance, in connection with any proceedings against SBS, SBS has claimed, continues to claim and may additionally claim that the Company is somehow liable for the defense of and any judgment or similar amount imposed against SBS (even though released) or its current or former owners and pursue that claim with litigation. The Company does not believe there is any basis for such claims and would defend them vigorously. There can be no assurance that plaintiffs or someone else will not claim that the Company is liable (under applicable law, through reimbursement or indemnification, or otherwise) for any such judgment or similar amount imposed against SBS, or that the Company will be able to defend successfully any claim. Any imposition of liability on the Company for any such amount could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur Majority Stockholders have made claims against the Company that may result in future judgements against the Company.\nThe Company's Directors and Majority Stockholders, Mr. William H. Bartels and Mr. Robert G. Brown and their companies are and have been involved in a number of material adverse claims and actions against the Company and have engaged or have threatened to engage in legal proceedings against the Company, which may result in future judgments or settlements adverse to the Company. On March 17, 2020, Mr. Bartels delivered to the Company a list of claims that he and Mr. Brown believe the Company owes them, which totaled approximately $3 million (net of their own \"anticipated\" reduction). The Company has rejected those unfounded and unsubstantiated claims, and believes it was released from all such claims by SBS in the SBS Chapter 11 Case and SBS Releases. See Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Domestic Related Party Services, SBS Bankruptcy, Settlement and March 2020 Claim, and March 2020 Claim, below, and Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters, Infotech Litigation and Settlement, below. While the Company believes that no such amount is owed, the ultimate result of this dispute cannot be known at this time.\nOur significant stockholders may take unilateral actions.\nThe Company's co-founders, Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels, are significant stockholders and Directors of SGRP. Mr. Robert G. Brown and certain of his related parties together beneficially own approximately 28.9% (or approximately 6.1 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock, Mr. Bartels and certain of his related parties together beneficially owning approximately 24.9% (or approximately 5.3 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock, and Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels together beneficially own approximately 53.8% of the SGRP Shares. Those amounts were calculated using their respective individual beneficial ownership and the total outstanding ownership (approximately 21.1 million shares) of the SGRP Common Stock on a non-diluted basis at December 31, 2020.\nMr. Brown and his related parties have required special stockholder meetings at the Company's expense and together with Mr. Bartels and his related parties have taken unilateral action several times bypassing the Board and its independent directors and other stockholder to (among other things) change the Company's By-Laws and add directors. If Messrs. Brown and Bartels and their related parties act again together as a group they have, and under certain circumstances if Mr. Brown and his related parties act alone he has, the ability to control (or significantly influence in the case of Mr. Brown acting alone) the election or removal of directors, the approval or disapproval of acquisitions, mergers, employee benefit plans, amendments to the Company's charter and/or bylaws, changes in Board size and all other matters that must or could be approved by the Company's stockholders.\nMr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. Bartels continue to have significant influence and leverage over the Company's business, corporate governance and other significant actions, including those involving stockholder approvals. The interests of the Majority Stockholders (such as changing Board composition and potentially weakening its independence, obtaining related party payments previously denied by the Company and Audit Committee and obtaining new retirement benefits for Mr. Brown previously denied by the Company and Compensation Committee) may be materially different from time to time from, and potentially in conflict with, the interests of other stockholders, and ownership concentration could cause, delay or prevent a change in the Company's control or otherwise discourage the Company's potential acquisition by another person, any of which could cause the market price of the SGRP Common Stock to decline and that decline could be significant.\nAdditionally, acting as a group, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels and their related parties could remove all or any part of the current Board by voting \"remove\" in any special stockholders meeting, or by voting \"no\" for targeted incumbents in any annual stockholders meeting or by executing more written consents. With fewer or no independent directors on the Board, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels could eventually be able to pay themselves without any effective restriction or accountability.\nThere can be no assurance that the Majority Stockholders will refrain from together taking any further unilateral action through their written consents, requiring special meetings, coordinated votes as directors or stockholders, or otherwise. If such actions by the Majority Stockholders continue in the future, the Company must continue do devote significant management time and legal and financial resources, which would otherwise be spent on the Company's day-to-day business operations, to respond to and attempt to resolve the frequent claims, responses and actions by the Majority Stockholders (individually and on behalf of SBS, SAS and Infotech), which have been increasing in frequency and intensity. In addition, such actions by the Majority Stockholders, or the by their Board at their urging, could lead to class action securities litigation that in turn could impose substantial costs on the Company, divert management's attention and resources from the day-to-day operations of the Company's business or its performance or condition. If the Majority Stockholders together continue to take such unilateral actions without restriction (see Note 6 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies -- Legal Matters - Delaware Litigations Settlement, below), it could have a material adverse effect the Company's stock price or on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nOur international local investors and local executives may act in a way that is inconsistent with our direction.\nThe Company's international model is to join forces with Local Investors (as defined below) having merchandising service expertise and combine their knowledge of the local market with the Company's proprietary software and expertise in the merchandising business. The Company also has begun to use this model in the United States (see Item 1 - Business - The Company's Domestic and International Segments, above). As a result, each of the Company's international subsidiaries (other than Canada and Japan) and National Merchandising Services, LLC (NMS) and Resource Plus Inc. (RPI) domestically are owned in material part by an entity in the local country where the international or domestic subsidiary resides and that entity is not otherwise affiliated with the Company (e.g., the \"Local Investor\"). The agreements between the Company and the Local Investor in the respective international or domestic subsidiaries specify, among other things, the equity, programming and support services the Company is required to provide and the equity, credit support, certain services and management support that the Local Investor is required to provide to the international or domestic subsidiary. Certain of those subsidiaries also may be procuring field merchandising execution through affiliates of the applicable Local Investors. The Local Investor or its principal generally is the Chief Executive Officer of the international or domestic subsidiary for an open-ended term and has considerable autonomy and authority over its operations. The Local Investors also may wish to conduct the subsidiary's business differently than desired by the Company. In the event of any disagreement or other dispute in the business relationships between the Company and Local Investor, the Local Investor may have one or more conflicts of interest with respect to the relationship and could cause the applicable international or domestic subsidiary to operate or otherwise act in a way that is not consistent with the Company's instructions or best interests. Using Local Investors in an acquisition has risks.\nThe agreements generally have unlimited contract terms and parties generally do not have the right to unilaterally withdraw. However, a non-defaulting party has the right to terminate such agreement upon the other party's default, receipt of notice and failure to cure within a specified period (generally 60 days internationally or 30 days domestically). In addition, either party, at any time after the end of a specified period (usually between three and five years), may: (1) sell all or part of its equity interest in the international subsidiary to a third party by providing a written notice to the other party of such intentions (in which case the other party has the right of first refusal and may purchase the equity in the international subsidiary of the offering party under the same terms and conditions) (a \"Right of First Refusal\"); or (2) offer to purchase the equity of the other party (in which case the other party generally has 120 days to either accept or reject the offer or to reverse the transaction and actually purchase the offering party's equity in the international subsidiary under the same terms and conditions) (a \"Buy/Sell Right\").\nThe Company believes its relationships with the Local Investors in its international subsidiaries remain good. Most of the Company's respective international subsidiary contracts are either at or near the end of the applicable periods during which either of the parties may trigger the Right of First Refusal and Buy/Sell Right provisions described above. Both the Company and such Local Investors, as part of their ongoing relationship, are or will be assessing appropriate action as described above.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company could (if necessary under the circumstances) successfully: (i) enforce its legal remedies and stop a Local Investor's principals from leaving the local subsidiary and establishing a competing business; (ii) replace equity, credit support, management, field merchandiser and other services currently provided by any Local Investor in sufficient time to perform its client obligations; or (iii) provide these services and or equity in the event the Local Stockholder were to sell its stock or reduce any support to the Company's subsidiary in the applicable country. Any cancellation, other nonperformance or material change under the subsidiary agreements with Local Investors could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.\nWe have inherent risks operating international businesses.\nThe Company operates in 10 countries around the world. There can be no assurances that the respective business environments will remain favorable. In the future, the Company's international operations and sales may be affected by the following risks, which may adversely affect United States companies doing business in foreign countries:\n\u25cf\nPolitical and economic risks, including terrorist attacks and political instability;\n\u25cf\nVarious forms of protectionist trade legislation that currently exist or have been proposed;\n\u25cf\nExpenses associated with customizing services and technology;\n\u25cf\nLocal laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u25cf\nDependence on local vendors and potential for undisclosed related party transactions;\n\u25cf\nMultiple conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations and enforcement;\n\u25cf\nPotentially adverse tax and employment law consequences;\n\u25cf\nLocal accounting principles, practices and procedures;\n\u25cf\nLocal legal principles, practices and procedures, local contract review and negotiation, and limited familiarity with contract issues (excessive warranties, extra-territoriality, sweeping intellectual property claims and the like);\n\u25cf\nLimited familiarity or an unwillingness to comply with, or wrongly believing the inapplicability of, generally accepted accounting principles in the USA (\"GAAP\"), applicable corporate controls and policies of the Company (including its ethics code), or applicable law in the USA (including Nasdaq rules, securities laws, anti-terrorism law, Sarbanes Oxley and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act);\n\u25cf\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the export of funds;\n\u25cf\nSubstantial communication barriers, including those arising from language, culture, custom and time zones; and\n\u25cf\nSupervisory challenges arising from agreements, distance, physical absences and such communication barriers.\nIf any developments should occur with respect to any of those international risks and materially and adversely affect the Company's applicable international subsidiary, such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its performance or condition (including its affiliates, assets, business, clients, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, legal costs, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, performance, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks, trends or condition), whether actual or as planned, intended, anticipated, estimated or otherwise expected.", "PERMNO": 83303, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SGRP"}
