{"cik": "744187", "company": "REX AMERICAN RESOURCES Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Ethanol and By-Products Business\nDuring the early months of 2020, a new strain of COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries.\nIn an effort to contain the spread of this virus, there have been various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privately implemented restrictions, including limiting public gatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working and the quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. The duration of the resulting downturn in economic activity is unknown. However, it has led to reduced demand for ethanol. This could lead to prolonged production stoppages at our ethanol plants and could result in an adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financial position. We idled our NuGen and One Earth ethanol plants for portions of fiscal year 2020.\nThe ethanol industry is changing rapidly which could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations.\nAccording to the RFA, the ethanol industry has grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 16.1 billion gallons in 2018. In 2020 and 2019, the industry produced approximately 13.8 and 15.8 billion gallons, respectively, with the reduction reflecting industry conditions. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants.\nThe financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supply shortages, so our results could fluctuate substantially.\nThe financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants.\nOur returns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices.\nCorn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and by-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and by-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce.\nThe price of corn is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the production and/or supply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants, to include intermittent production slowdowns or stoppages. Increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. International demand for corn could also result in higher corn prices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economic terms due to regional supply shortages, transportation issues, delays in farmer marketing decisions or unfavorable local pricing. Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nThe spread between ethanol and corn prices can vary significantly.\nThe gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants.\nOur risk management strategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity.\nIn an attempt to partially offset the impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into: i) forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements and; ii) commodity futures and swap agreements. The financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amount and type of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodity prices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe market for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in their manufacturing process.\nOur ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants\u2019 control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental regulation and foreign and domestic relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants\u2019 ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants.\nFluctuations in the selling price of commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants.\nEthanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline, and our ethanol plants\u2019 results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases or the price of gasoline declines making ethanol less economical.\nDistillers grains compete with other protein based animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are made. Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instances when the price increase for distillers grains has lagged increases in corn prices.\nThe production of distillers grains has increased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncreased ethanol production or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease.\nAccording to the RFA, domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 17.4 billion gallons per year. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfied by corn-derived ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons for 2019 and 2020. However, the RFS requirements have been reduced through small refiner waivers (\u201cSRWs\u201d) issued by the EPA. These SRWs were in the amount of approximately 4.0 billion gallons for 85 refinery exemptions of ethanol for 2016 through 2018. There have been no rulings on waiver requests for subsequent years. The EPA has not yet released a draft rule for the 2021 volumes, despite the fact they typically release a draft mid-year of the preceding year and finalize the rule by November 30 of the preceding year. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs.\nExcess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire non-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, decreased overall economic activity could also lead to reduced gasoline consumption.\nIn addition, because ethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as by-products, increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants\u2019 distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-food grade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.\nThe price of ethanol and distillers grains may decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United States or from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into various other countries with trade agreements with the United States. If tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States exported approximately 1.3 billion gallons of ethanol in 2020, down from approximately 1.5 and approximately 1.7 billion gallons in 2019 and 2018, respectively. If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. Brazil, China and the European Union all have trade barriers or tariffs against fuel ethanol. In 2013, the European Union imposed a five year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. fuel ethanol to discourage competition. Effective January 1, 2017, China indicated its intention to raise its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. On April 1, 2018, China raised their tariff rate to 45%, and later raised it to 70% in the U.S. and China trade war. On September 1, 2017, Brazil imposed a 20% tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The tariff was extended several times but lapsed in December 2020 and a 20% tariff now applies to all U.S. ethanol exported to Brazil. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.\nIn 2020, approximately 11.0 million metric tons (\u201cmmt\u201d) of distillers grains were exported which represented a record high of 38% of U.S. production. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. Exports to China were approximately 2% of U.S. global shipments in 2019 versus approximately 51% in 2015, due to punitive tariffs established beginning January 2017 in effect for 5 years per the RFA. Chinese exports rebounded slightly in 2020 but still remained depressed compared to earlier years. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably.\nFuture demand for ethanol is uncertain and changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.\nThere are limited markets for ethanol other than what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol to achieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels.\nWe depend on our partners to operate certain of our ethanol investments.\nOur investments currently represent both majority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local investor group. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.\nWe may not successfully acquire or develop additional ethanol investments.\nThe growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders and owners, financial institutions, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments.\nAny expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future market conditions. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investments could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ethanol plants may be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.\nThe development and implementation of new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol.\nAny advances in technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.\nIn addition, alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol. Consumer demand for gasoline may be reduced by transportation related technological advances such as electric and hybrid vehicles. Several automobile manufacturers have announced target dates into the 2030s for ceasing production of gasoline vehicles and shifting production to electric vehicles. In addition, countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the state of California have pledged to ban the sale of vehicles with internal combustion engines over time. The Biden administration, in its early stages, appears to have placed an increased emphasis on electric vehicles. Reduced demand for ethanol could cause our results of operations to be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nThe renewable fuel standard program was authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA increased the amount of renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022, with no specified volume subsequent to 2022. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several years various pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blending requirements. To date, none of the bills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effort to undermine the EISA.\nUnder EISA, the EPA has the authority to waive or modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determine in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the country. In certain past years the EPA has taken action to reduce the mandated gallons called for under EISA for both conventional and advanced renewable fuels.\nPursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol was maintained at 15 billion gallons, 2019 was the second consecutive year the total proposed RVOs was more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. The EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemaking process. However, the EPA announced it would not move forward with a reset rulemaking in 2020. After 2022, volumes will be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, taking into account such factors as environmental impact, energy security, future production rates, costs to consumers, infrastructure, impacts on commodity and food prices, job creation and rural economic development.\nObligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a result of fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated parties have petitioned the EPA and filed court actions to change the point of obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. The EPA granted 85 total SRWs for 2016 through 2018 totaling approximately 4.0 billion gallons. This action led to reduced values for RINs and further action could decrease RIN values and ethanol pricing.\nIn January 2020, the U.S Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit overturned the EPA\u2019s granting of refinery exemptions to three refineries on two separate grounds. The Court ruled refineries are eligible for SRWs only if such waivers are extensions of waivers granted in previous years. The refineries did not qualify for waivers in the year prior to the year the EPA granted them. The Court also stated the disproportionate economic hardship of SRWs should be based solely on whether compliance with RFS II creates such hardship, not whether compliance and other issues create the hardship. The refiners appeal was denied. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in January 2021, the Supreme Court announced they agreed to hear the case.\nDue to the 10th Circuit ruling, a number of refiners have applied for gap year SRWs in an effort to establish continuous years of relief and to attempt to ensure they qualify for SRWs going forward. Until the Supreme Court rules on this case, there remains uncertainty regarding volume obligations. The EPA has not ruled on SRWs for years after 2018.\nAt the same time the EPA took action (in 2019) to allow the RVP waiver for E-15 for the summer months, it also took RIN market reform action. The reform action requires public disclosure when RIN holdings exceed specified thresholds by an entity and requires the reporting of additional price and affiliate data to the EPA.\nFlexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices.\nUnfavorable changes in legislation or regulations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nThe inability to generate or obtain RINs could adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customers to comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs varies based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA.\nVarious studies have criticized the efficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.\nAlthough many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices to increase for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn.\nIf these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.\nFederal support of cellulosic ethanol may result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn-derived biofuels. These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanol and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business.\nOur ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants.\nOur ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental, or which increase our costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources.\nOur ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plants are grandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but recent plant expansion requires us to meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations with respect to emissions of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements.\nThe California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\u201cLCFS\u201d) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions and in other states if they adopt similar standards. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nOur ethanol business may become subject to various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.\nOperation of our ethanol business exposes the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply with environmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissions of other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows.\nOur business is not diversified.\nOur financial results depend heavily on our ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of diversification could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably.\nWe may have commitments to produce and sell ethanol.\nWe may, at times, sell our products with forward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors, we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may have commitments to purchase commodities.\nWe may, at times, purchase certain commodities with forward contracts without a corresponding quantity of ethanol sold via forward contracts at known prices. Should ethanol and by-product prices decline to levels that would lead to significant unprofitable results of operations, we may incur additional costs and/or losses to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur revenue from the sale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed.\nDistillers grains is a by-product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination; therefore, antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacement for antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains.\nAn estimated 38% of distillers grains produced in the United States were exported in 2020. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product. In recent years, certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipments are rejected or delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations.\nWe extract non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determine whether non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in the ethanol industry.\nWe face significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy.\nThe ethanol industry is primarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations.\nWe may face competition from foreign producers.\nThere is a risk of foreign competition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil\u2019s ethanol production is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Under the RFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard.\nIf significant additional foreign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lower prices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These risks could have significant adverse effects on our financial performance.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers.\nThe inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to make our payments when due.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants.\nOur ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants.\nOur plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and water to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business.\nOur plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If there is an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A production halt for an extended period of time could result in material losses.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delays and/or interruptions in plant operations, product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.\nWe are exposed to potential business disruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, pandemic diseases and unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results.\nPotential business disruption in available transportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, the outbreak of a pandemic disease, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers.\nRail cars used to transport ethanol may need to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations.\nThe leased rail cars we use to transport ethanol to market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) imposes an enhanced tank car standard known as the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This could lead to increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periods of time.\nWe operate in a capital intensive industry. Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may need to incur additional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcy filings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanol industry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nRisks Related to our Refined Coal Operations\nWe believe our refined coal production company qualifies to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November 18, 2021. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with this investment is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.\nAvailability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45.\nOur ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon our refined coal operation satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. The IRS could ultimately determine that our refined coal facility and/or its operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. As our refined coal operation is expected to generate pre-tax losses, the unavailability of the tax credits for any reason could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe refined coal operation depends on one customer.\nThe refined coal operation receives tax credits by selling its refined coal to an unrelated party. The unrelated party is not obligated to continue purchasing refined coal from us. Our user of refined coal could convert its fuel source to natural gas, oil or some other source instead of coal depending on the price of natural gas, oil or other sources relative to that of coal. If the unrelated party ceases to purchase refined coal from us, we would likely cease operations, given that we only intend to operate the refined coal plant until November 18, 2021. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause users of coal to phase out or close existing coal using operations. If users of coal burn less coal or eliminate the use of coal, there would be less need for our product. A reduction or cessation of refined coal sales could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nEnvironmental concerns regarding coal could lead to reduced or suspended refined coal operations.\nEnvironmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potentially hazardous nature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discourage the burning of coal. Such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur refined coal operation and its by-products may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.\nThe construction and operation of refined coal operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party\u2019s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal in a number of ways, including air emissions, wastewater, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. We may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal.\nOnce we permanently cease operations, we are responsible to remove all the equipment, supplies and materials from the utility host site. This could result in additional cost and the risk of environmental damage or impact.\nNo assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a third party to operate the refined coal facility.\nWe rely on an unrelated third party to operate the refined coal plant. Should the third party fail to perform or underperform in the operation, management or regulatory compliance of the facility, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as we are not experienced in operating a refined coal facility.\nWe will have to generate taxable income to utilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits.\nIf we do not generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributes which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use patented technology.\nAs part of the operations, we pay a license fee for patented technology. If our third party operator is subject to patent infringement claims, we may incur legal fees to defend our position and be subject to additional costs and fees.\nRisks Related to our eSteam investment\neSteam testing methods and results are not known.\nWe do not have specific testing methodologies or specifications developed for testing the viability of the eSteam technology. The actual eSteam testing process could result in injury to others, and property and other damages that could expose us to claims for damages from unrelated parties.\nOur eSteam technology may be subject to patent challenges.\nIf our patents of the eSteam technology are challenged, we could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our patents.\nOperations utilizing our eSteam technology may cause environmental damage.\nWhen testing and operating the eSteam technology, we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water and other fluids into the ground to generate underground steam in order to extract oil. We could be subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage.\nRisks Related to REX and General Risk Factors\nGiven the amount of our cash and short-term investments, actions by the Federal Reserve, related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which have reduced interest rates and could impact future periods.\nDepending on the length of time interest rates remain at these levels, this could result in an adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financial position.\nWe have concentrations of cash deposits at financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.\nWe generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, or other investments.\nWe intend to continue seeking growth opportunities. Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include:\n\u25cf The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized, or take longer to realize than expected,\n\u25cf Future acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment,\n\u25cf Future acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete these transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and\n\u25cf Future acquisitions may require us to invest a significant portion of our excess cash, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFederal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return positions.\nWe use significant judgments, estimates and interpretation and application of complex tax laws in preparing the tax returns we file, and the positions contained therein. We believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable. However, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions. We are currently undergoing a federal income examination for the years ended January 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. This could result in material additional income tax payments we would have to make and higher income tax expense in future periods.", "PERMNO": 68830, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "REX"}
