{"cik": "1514705", "company": "SunCoke Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. These risk factors represent what we believe to be the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to these risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business and Industry\nUnfavorable economic conditions in the U. S. and globally, may cause a reduction in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nSustained volatility and disruption in worldwide capital and credit markets in the U.S. and globally could cause reduced demand for our products. Additionally, unfavorable economic conditions, including the potentially reduced availability of credit, may cause reduced demand for steel products or reduced demand for coal, either of which, in turn, could adversely affect demand for our products and services. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nAdverse developments at our cokemaking, coal logistics and/or coal mining, operations, including equipment failures or deterioration of assets, may lead to production curtailments, shutdowns or additional expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur cokemaking, coal logistics and coal mining operations are subject to significant hazards and risks that include, but are not limited to, equipment malfunction, explosions, fires and the effects of severe weather conditions and extreme temperatures, any of which could result in production and transportation difficulties and disruptions, pollution, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others.\nAdverse developments at our cokemaking facilities could significantly disrupt our coke, steam and/or electricity production and our ability to supply coke, steam, and/or electricity to our customers. Adverse developments at our coal logistics operations could significantly disrupt our ability to provide coal handling, blending, storage, terminalling, transloading and/or transportation services to our customers. Adverse developments at our coal mining operations could significantly disrupt our ability to produce and distribute coal. Any sustained disruption at our cokemaking, coal logistics and/or coal mining operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere is a risk of mechanical failure of our equipment both in the normal course of operations and following unforeseen events. Our cokemaking, coal logistics and coal mining operations depend upon critical pieces of equipment that occasionally may be out of service for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures. Our facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, accidents or violent weather conditions or extreme temperatures. As a result, we may experience interruptions in our processing and production capabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, to the extent a disruption leads to our failure to maintain the temperature inside our coke oven batteries, we would not be able to continue operation of such coke ovens, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements for coke.\nAssets and equipment critical to the operations of our cokemaking, coal logistics and coal mining operations also may deteriorate or become depleted materially sooner than we currently estimate. Such deterioration of assets may result in additional maintenance spending or additional capital expenditures. If these assets do not generate the amount of future cash flows that we expect, and we are not able to procure replacement assets in an economically feasible manner, our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management\u2019s plans change with respect to those assets. If we are required to incur impairment charges in the future, our results of operations in the period taken could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which may increase our cost of doing business and have an adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to: discharges of substances into the air and water; emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHG; management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; cleanup of contaminated sites; protection of groundwater quality and availability; protection of plants and wildlife; reclamation and restoration of properties after completion of mining or drilling; installation of safety equipment in our facilities; control of surface subsidence from underground mining; and protection of employee health and safety. Complying with these requirements, including the terms of our permits, can be costly and time-consuming, and may delay commencement or hinder continuation of operations. In addition, these requirements are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. These requirements may change in the future in a manner that could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with these regulations or permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could limit or materially increase the cost of our operations. We may not have been, or may not be, at all times, in complete compliance with all of these requirements, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements, or in connection with remediation at sites we own, or third-party sites where it has been alleged that we have liability, in excess of the amounts we have accrued. For a description of certain environmental laws and matters applicable to us, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Legal and Regulatory Requirements.\u201d\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or renew permits or leases necessary for our operations, which could materially reduce our production, cash flows or profitability.\nOur cokemaking, coal logistics and coal mining operations require us to obtain a number of permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and operational matters. These, as well as our facilities and operations (including our generation of electricity), include permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently, and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by our regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future cokemaking, coal logistics, and/or coal mining facilities. Non-governmental organizations, environmental groups and individuals have certain statutory rights to engage in the permitting process, and may comment upon, or object to, the requested permits. Such persons also have the right to bring citizen\u2019s lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, or the validity of environmental impact statements related thereto. If any permits or leases are not issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or if permits issued or renewed are conditioned in a manner that restricts our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our operations, our cash flows or profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur businesses are subject to inherent risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we self-insure. We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. We may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, certain environmental and pollution risks generally are not fully insurable. Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from un-insured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.\nWe also may incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. We must compensate employees for work-related injuries. If we do not make adequate provision for our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities, or we are pursued for applicable sanctions, costs and liabilities, our operations and our profitability could be adversely affected.\nDivestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business. In particular, if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our current efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of our coal mining business, or are unable to conclude such sale or disposal upon favorable terms, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly review strategic opportunities to further our business objectives, and may eliminate assets that do not meet our return-on-investment criteria. We are currently engaged in efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of our coal mining\nbusiness as part of a strategic review and realignment of our businesses and priorities. If we are unable to complete such sale or other disposal upon favorable terms, or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe anticipated benefits of divestitures and other strategic transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than we expected. Such transactions also could result in a number of financial consequences having a material effect on our results of operations and our financial position, including reduced cash balances; higher fixed expenses; the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities (including indemnification obligations); restructuring charges; loss of customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors or employees; legal, accounting and advisory fees; and impairment charges.\nIn connection with our previously announced intention to sell or otherwise dispose of our coal mining business, our coal mining operations have been reflected as discontinued operations and the related net assets are presented as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements. We have recorded impairment charges for the write-down of coal mining assets and related goodwill, and we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant exit and disposal costs relating to employee separation and retention and contract termination, among other things. In addition, we expect to retain certain legacy coal mining liabilities for black lung, workers' compensation and other post retirement employee benefit obligations.\nIn the event that a sale of our coal mining business does not occur, we will evaluate the various restructuring options to further rationalize coal production over the near term and potentially cease coal production. At this time, we are unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate with respect to the charges related to such potential actions. However, any such charges could result in significant additional future cash expenditures.\nOur failure to generate significant cost savings from the sale or other disposal of our coal mining business could affect our profitability adversely and weaken our competitive position. Additionally, following a complete exit from the coal mining business, we will be entirely dependent upon third parties for a supply of metallurgical coal adequate for the manufacture of coke at our cokemaking facilities. Our inability to acquire sufficient metallurgical coal at favorable prices, or the failure of our future suppliers to deliver metallurgical coal in accordance with our required specifications, could have a material and adverse impact on our business or results of operations.\nWe may experience significant risks associated with future acquisitions and/or investments.\nThe success of our future acquisitions and/or investments will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions or investments on favorable terms, as well as to finance such acquisitions or investments and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations. Antitrust and other laws may prevent us from completing acquisitions. If we are unable to integrate new operations successfully, our financial results and business reputation could suffer.\nRisks associated with acquisitions include the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with the sellers, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience. Additionally, in the event we form joint ventures or other similar arrangements, we must pay close attention to the organizational formalities and time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. We may share ownership and management with other parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do. The benefits from a successful investment in an existing entity or joint venture will be shared among the co-owners, so we will not receive the exclusive benefits from a successful investment. Additionally, if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail, causing increased expenses and loss of sales. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nOur business is dependent on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems, including our enterprise resource planning tools. We process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems. If a key system was to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, our operations and financial results could be affected adversely. Our systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach, terrorist attack, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar event. Our disaster recovery plans may not entirely prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. Our business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our networks. Such data includes: intellectual property; our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our\ninformation technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could seriously and adversely affect our business.\nOur operating results have been and may continue to be affected by fluctuations in our costs of production, and, if we cannot pass increases in our costs of production to our customers, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nOur operations require a reliable supply of equipment and replacement parts. Over the course of the last two to three years, many of the components of our cost of produced coke and coal revenues, including cost of supplies, equipment and labor, have experienced significant price inflation, and such price inflation may continue in the future. Our profit margins may be reduced and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the costs of production increase significantly and we cannot pass such increases in our costs of production to our customers.\nLabor disputes with the unionized portion of our workforce could affect us adversely. Union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.\nWe rely, at one or more of our facilities, on unionized labor, and there is always the possibility that we may be unable to reach agreement on terms and conditions of employment or renewal of a collective bargaining agreement. When collective bargaining agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to negotiate new agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements, or at all, and without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. If we are unable to negotiate the renewal of a collective bargaining agreement before its expiration date, our operations and our profitability could be adversely affected. A prolonged labor dispute, which may include a work stoppage, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our customers\u2019 orders and, as a result, adversely affect our operations, or the stability of production and reduce our future revenues, or profitability. It is also possible that, in the future, additional employee groups may choose to be represented by a labor union.\nOur ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe have implemented recruitment, training and retention efforts to optimally staff our operations. Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects. With respect to our represented employees, we may be adversely impacted by the loss of employees who retire or obtain other employment during a layoff or a work stoppage.\nWe have obligations for long-term employee plan benefits that may involve expenses that are greater than we have assumed.\nWe are required to provide various long-term employee benefits to retired employees and current employees who will retire in the future. We have estimated these obligations based on actuarial assumptions described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. However, if our assumptions are inaccurate, we could be required to expend materially greater amounts than anticipated, and this could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently are, and likely will be, subject to litigation, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future, including disputes relating to our operations and commercial and contractual arrangements. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally within our control. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims where appropriate, but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability. In addition, our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future. We are also subject to significant environmental and other government regulation, which sometimes results in various administrative proceedings. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and the credit facilities.\nSubject to the limits contained in our credit agreement, the indenture that governs our notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Specifically, a higher level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and our other debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the indenture that governs the notes and the credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We have entered into and may in the future enter into additional interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may decide not to maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nWe face substantial debt maturities which may adversely affect our consolidated financial positions.\nOver the next six years, including the debt refinancing activities of the January 2015 dropdown, we have approximately $705 million of total consolidated debt maturing at SunCoke and the Partnership (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We may not be able to refinance this debt, or may be forced to do so on terms substantially less favorable than our currently outstanding debt. We may be forced to delay or not make capital expenditures, which may adversely affect our competitive position and financial results.\nRating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings, which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financing costs.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.\nRisks Related to Our Cokemaking Business\nOur cokemaking business is subject to operating risks, some of which are beyond our control, that could result in a material increase in our operating expenses.\nFactors beyond our control could disrupt our cokemaking operations, adversely affect our ability to service the needs of our customers, and increase our operating costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Such factors could include:\n\u2022\nearthquakes, subsidence and unstable ground or other conditions that may cause damage to infrastructure or personnel;\n\u2022\nfire, explosion, or other major incident causing injury to personnel and/or equipment, resulting in all or part of the cokemaking operations at one of our facilities to cease, or be severely curtailed for a period of time;\n\u2022\nprocessing and plant equipment failures, operating hazards and unexpected maintenance problems affecting our cokemaking operations or our customers; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural disasters, such as severe winds, heavy rains, snow, flooding, extremes of temperature, and other natural events affecting cokemaking operations, transportation, or our customers.\nIf any of these conditions or events occur, our cokemaking operations may be disrupted, operating costs could increase significantly, and we could incur substantial losses in this business segment. Disruptions in our cokemaking operations could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk, and certain other risks, of our major customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our major customers, or the failure of our customers to continue to purchase coke from us at similar prices under similar arrangements, may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our major customers. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration of their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, whose operations are concentrated in a single industry, the steel industry. We sell coke to these customers pursuant to long-term take-or-pay agreements that require that our customers either purchase all of our coke production or a specified tonnage maximum greater than our stated capacity, as applicable, or pay the contract price for any such coke they elect not to accept. Our customers experience significant fluctuations in demand for steel products because of economic conditions, consumer demand, raw material and energy costs and decisions by the U.S. federal and state governments to fund or not fund infrastructure projects, such as highways, bridges, schools, energy plants, railroads and transportation facilities. During periods of weak demand for steel, our customers may experience significant reductions in their operations, or substantial declines in the prices of the steel they sell. These and other factors may lead some customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their existing long-term coke purchase commitments to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nIf a substantial portion of our agreements to supply coke, electricity, and/or steam are modified or terminated, our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are not able to replace such agreements, or if we are not able to enter into new agreements at the same level of profitability.\nWe make substantially all of our coke, electricity and steam sales under long-term agreements. If a substantial portion of these agreements are modified or terminated or if force majeure is exercised, our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are not able to replace such agreements, or if we are not able to enter into new agreements at the same level of profitability. The profitability of our long-term coke, energy and steam sales agreements depends on a variety of factors that vary from agreement to agreement and fluctuate during the agreement term. We may not be able to obtain long-term agreements at favorable prices, compared either to market conditions or to our cost structure. Price changes provided in long-term supply agreements may not reflect actual increases in production costs. As a result, such cost increases may reduce profit margins on our long-term coke and energy sales agreements. In addition, contractual provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short-term price volatility.\nFrom time to time, we discuss the extension of existing agreements and enter into new long-term agreements for the supply of coke and energy to our customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coke or electricity from us under long-term agreements. If any one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coke or electricity from us, or if we were unable to sell coke or electricity to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our cash flows, financial position or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, because of certain technological design constraints, we do not have the ability to shut down our cokemaking operations if we do not have adequate customer demand. If a customer refuses to take or pay for our coke, we must continuously operate our coke ovens even though we may not be able to sell our coke immediately and may incur significant additional costs for natural gas to maintain the temperature inside our coke oven batteries, which may have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nThe financial performance of our cokemaking business is substantially dependent upon three customers in the steel industry, and any failure by them to perform under their contracts with us could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our domestic coke sales are currently made under long-term contracts with ArcelorMittal, U.S. Steel and AK Steel. We expect these three customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the\nforeseeable future. If any one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce its purchases of coke from us, or default on their agreements with us, or fail to renew or terminate its agreements with us, or if we were unable to sell coke to any one or more of these customers on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our cash flows, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe coke sales agreement and the energy sales agreement with AK Steel at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination under certain circumstances and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and therefore our ability to distribute cash to unitholders.\nThe coke sales agreement and the energy sales agreement with AK Steel at Haverhill 2, or the Haverhill AK Steel Contracts, are subject to early termination by AK Steel under certain circumstances and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business. The Haverhill coke sales agreement with AK Steel expires on January 1, 2022, with two automatic, successive five-year renewal periods. The Haverhill energy sales agreement with AK Steel runs concurrently with the term of the coke sales agreement, including any renewals, and automatically terminates upon the termination of the related coke sales agreement. The coke sales agreement may be terminated by AK Steel at any time on or after January 1, 2014 upon two years prior written notice if AK Steel (i) permanently shuts down iron production operations at its steel plant works in Ashland, Kentucky, or the Ashland Plant; and (ii) has not acquired or begun construction of a new blast furnace in the U.S. to replace, in whole or in part, the Ashland Plant\u2019s iron production capacity. If such termination occurs at any time prior to January 1, 2018, AK Steel will be required to pay a significant termination fee.\nIf AK Steel were to terminate the Haverhill AK Steel Contracts, we may be unable to enter into similar long-term contracts with replacement customers for all or any portion of the coke previously purchased by AK Steel. Similarly, we may be forced to sell some or all of the previously contracted coke in the spot market, which could be at prices lower than we have currently contracted for and could subject us to significant price volatility. If AK Steel elects to terminate the Haverhill AK Steel Contracts, our cash flows, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to specific risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the U.S., which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nOur foreign operations expose us to several risks that are beyond our control, including, among other things, political and economic instability within the host country; foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors; difficulty recruiting and retaining management of our overseas operations; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; changing taxation policies; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; revaluations, devaluations and restrictions on repatriation of currency; and import/export quotas and restrictions or other trade barriers.\nIn recent years, the Indian government's regulation of iron ore production resulted in iron ore scarcity in the state of Odisha, where our cokemaking facilities are located, severely affected Indian steel makers such as our joint venture partner, VISA Steel, that did not have captive mines. Although this regulation has now been effectively repealed, other similar regulation in the future could have, a significant and adverse effect on the profitability of our Indian joint venture.\nThe Indian steelmaking industry is dependent on imported coking coal, since India has very low reserves of prime coking coal. This has led to a dependence upon expensive imports from countries like Australia. VISA SunCoke Limited, our cokemaking joint venture with VISA Steel in India is dependent on coking coal to support its operations. However, logistical issues, such as port congestion in Australia and lack of other good quality options for sourcing coking coal, is a prime cause of concern. If we are unable to secure adequate supplies of coking coal at reasonable prices, the results of operations of our Indian joint venture could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly and adversely affect results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations outside the U.S. have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real, among others. Because our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are reported in U.S. dollars, we translate revenues, expenses and balance sheet accounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Currency exchange rates are influenced by local inflation, growth, interest rates, governmental actions and other events and circumstances beyond our control.\nIncreases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in such foreign currencies.\nOur India Coke business segment purchases metallurgical coal to be used in the production of coke. Since these purchases of coal are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the functional currency of this business segment is the Indian rupee, such transactions are subject to foreign currency risk. In addition, unexpected and dramatic fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates, such as the recent deterioration in value of the Indian rupee, could materially and adversely affect the value of our earnings from our India Coke business segment. Although our India Coke business segment uses derivative financial instruments to hedge currency fluctuations for anticipated purchases of coal used in the production of coke, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, or other currencies, would not materially affect our financial results.\nIncome from operation of the Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil cokemaking facility may be affected by global and regional economic and political factors and the policies and actions of the Brazilian government.\nThe Vit\u00f3ria cokemaking facility is owned by a project company controlled by a Brazilian affiliate of ArcelorMittal. We earn income from the Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil operations through licensing and operating fees earned at the Brazilian cokemaking facility payable to us under long-term agreements with the project company and an annual preferred dividend from the project company guaranteed by the Brazilian affiliate of ArcelorMittal. These revenues depend on continuing operations and, in some cases, certain minimum production levels being achieved at the Vit\u00f3ria cokemaking facility. In the past, the Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent and occasionally extensive intervention by the Brazilian government and unstable economic cycles. The Brazilian government has changed in the past, and may change monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence Brazil\u2019s economy in the future. If the operations at Vit\u00f3ria cokemaking facility are interrupted or if certain minimum production levels are not achieved, we will not be able to earn the same licensing and operating fees as we are currently earning, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nExcess capacity in the global steel industry, including in China, may weaken demand for steel produced by our U.S. steel industry customers, which, in turn, may reduce demand for our coke.\nIn some countries, such as China, steelmaking capacity exceeds demand for steel products. Rather than reducing employment by matching production capacity to consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) may export steel at prices that are significantly below their home market prices and that may not reflect their costs of production or capital. The availability of this steel at such prices may negatively affect our steelmaking customers, who may not be able to increase and may have to decrease, the prices that they charge for steel as the supply of steel increases. Our customers may also reduce their steel output in response to this increased supply, which would correspondingly reduce their demand for coke and make it more likely that they may seek to renegotiate their contracts with us or fail to pay for the coke they are required to take under our contracts. As a result, the profitability and financial position of our steelmaking customers may be adversely affected, which in turn, could adversely affect the certainty of our long-term relationships with those customers, as well as our ability to sell excess capacity in the spot market, and our own results of operations.\nIncreased exports of coke from producing countries may weaken our customers\u2019 demand for coke capacity.\nIn recent years, significantly increased availability and supply of Chinese coke has exerted downward pressure on the pricing of coke sold by VISA SunCoke, our Indian joint venture. Future increases in exports of coke from China and/or other producing countries may reduce our customers\u2019 demand for coke capacity, which could depress coke prices and limit our ability to enter into new, or renew existing, commercial arrangements with our customers, as well as our ability to sell excess capacity in the spot market, and could materially and adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nWe face increasing competition both from alternative steelmaking and cokemaking technologies that have the potential to reduce or completely eliminate the use of coke, which may reduce the demand for the coke we produce and which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHistorically, coke has been used as a main input in the production of steel in blast furnaces. However, some blast furnace operators have reduced the amount of coke per ton of hot metal through alternative injectants, such as natural gas and pulverized coal, and the use of these coke substitutes could increase in the future, particularly in light of current low natural gas prices. Many steelmakers also are exploring alternatives to blast furnace technology that require less or no use of coke. For example, electric arc furnace technology is a commercially proven process widely used in the U.S. As these alternative processes for production of steel become more widespread, the demand for coke, including the coke we produce, may be significantly reduced, and this reduction could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also face competition from alternative cokemaking technologies, including both by-product and heat recovery technologies. As these technologies improve and as new technologies are developed, competition in the cokemaking industry may intensify.\nCertain provisions in our long-term coke agreements may result in economic penalties to us, or may result in termination of our coke sales agreements for failure to meet minimum volume requirements or other required specifications, and certain provisions in these agreements and our energy sales agreements may permit our customers to suspend performance.\nOur agreements for the supply of coke, energy and/or steam, contain provisions requiring us to supply minimum volumes of our products to our customers. To the extent we do not meet these minimum volumes, we are generally required under the terms of our coke sales agreements to procure replacement supply to our customers at the applicable contract price or potentially be subject to cover damages for any shortfall. If future shortfalls occur, we will work with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements at the facility, but we may not be successful in identifying alternative supplies and may be subject to paying the contract price for any shortfall or to cover damages, either of which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability. Our coke sales agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coke that meets certain quality thresholds. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of our agreements.\nOur coke and energy sales agreements contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by our customers for the duration of specified events beyond the control of our customers. Declaration of force majeure, coupled with a lengthy suspension of performance under one or more coke or energy sales agreements, may seriously and adversely affect our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\nTo the extent we do not meet coal-to-coke yield standards in our coke sales agreements, we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability.\nOur ability to pass through our coal costs to our customers under our coke sales agreements is generally subject to our ability to meet some form of coal-to-coke yield standard. To the extent that we do not meet the yield standard in the contract, we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process. We may not be able to meet the yield standards at all times, and as a result we may suffer lower margins on our coke sales and our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our cokemaking facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe quality of our coke is critical to the success of our business. For instance, our coke sales agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coke that meets certain quality thresholds. If our coke fails to meet such specifications, we could be subject to significant contractual damages or contract terminations, and our sales could be negatively affected. The quality of our coke depends significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDisruptions to our supply of coal and coal blending services may reduce the amount of coke we produce and deliver, and if we are not able to cover the shortfall in coal supply or obtain replacement blending services from other providers, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.\nMost of the metallurgical coal used to produce coke at our cokemaking facilities, other than our Jewell facility, is purchased from third parties under one- to two-year contracts. We cannot assure that there will continue to be an ample supply of metallurgical coal available or that we will be able to supply these facilities without any significant disruption in coke production, as economic, environmental, and other conditions outside of our control may reduce our ability to source sufficient amounts of coal for our forecasted operational needs. The failure of our coal suppliers to meet their supply commitments could materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are not able to make up the shortfalls resulting from such supply failures through purchases of coal from other sources.\nOther than at our Jewell cokemaking facility, we rely on third parties to blend coals that we have purchased into coal blends that we use to produce coke. We have entered into long-term agreements with coal blending service providers that are coterminous with our coke sales agreements. However, there are limited alternative providers of coal blending services and any disruptions from our current service providers could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, if our rail transportation agreements are terminated, we may have to pay higher rates to access rail lines or make alternative transportation arrangements.\nLimitations on the availability and reliability of transportation, and increases in transportation costs, particularly rail systems, could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain a supply of coal and deliver coke to our customers.\nOur ability to obtain coal depends primarily on third-party rail systems and to a lesser extent river barges. If we are unable to obtain rail or other transportation services, or are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Alternative transportation and delivery systems are generally inadequate and not suitable to handle the quantity of our shipments or to ensure timely delivery. The loss of access to rail capacity could create temporary disruption until the access is restored, significantly impairing our ability to receive coal and resulting in materially decreased revenues. Our ability to open new cokemaking facilities may also be affected by the availability and cost of rail or other transportation systems available for servicing these facilities.\nOur coke production obligations at our Jewell cokemaking facility and one half of our Haverhill cokemaking facility require us to deliver coke to certain customers via railcar. We have entered into long-term rail transportation agreements to meet these obligations. Disruption of these transportation services because of weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, train derailments, infrastructure damage, strikes, lock-outs, lack of fuel or maintenance items, fuel costs, transportation delays, accidents, terrorism, domestic catastrophe or other events could temporarily, or over the long-term, impair our ability to produce coke, and therefore, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Coal Logistics Business\nThe growth and success of our coal logistics business depends upon our ability to find and contract for adequate throughput volumes, and an extended decline in demand for coal could affect the customers for our coal logistics business adversely. As a consequence, the operating results and cash flows of our coal logistics business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe financial results of our Coal Logistics business segment are significantly affected by the demand for both thermal coal and metallurgical coal. An extended decline in our customers\u2019 demand for either thermal or metallurgical coals could result in a reduced need for the coal blending, terminalling and transloading services we offer, thus reducing throughput and utilization of our coal logistics assets. Demand for such coals may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control:\n\u2022\nThe demand for thermal coal can be impacted by changes in the energy consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users, as well as weather conditions and extreme temperatures. The amount of thermal coal consumed for electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, the availability, quality and price of competing fuels for power generation, and governmental regulation. Natural gas-fueled generation has the potential to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. State and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources, or the retrofitting of existing coal-fired generators with pollution control systems, also could adversely impact the demand for thermal coal. Finally, unusually warm winter weather may reduce the commercial and residential needs for heat and electricity which, in turn, may reduce the demand for thermal coal; and\n\u2022\nThe demand for metallurgical coal for use in the steel industry may be impacted adversely by economic downturns resulting in decreased demand for steel and an overall decline in steel production. A decline in blast furnace production of steel may reduce the demand for furnace coke, an intermediate product made from metallurgical coal. Decreased demand for metallurgical coal also may result from increased steel industry utilization of processes that do not use, or reduce the need for, furnace coke, such as electric arc furnaces, or blast furnace injection of pulverized coal or natural gas.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in the market price of coal can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new and existing coal reserves. Mining activity may decrease as spot coal prices decrease. We have no control over the level of mining activity by coal producers, which may be affected by prevailing and projected coal prices, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of coal reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital. A material decrease in coal mining production in the areas of operation for our coal logistics business, whether as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of coal processed through our coal logistics facilities, which would reduce our revenues and operating income.\nDecreased demand for thermal or metallurgical coals, and extended or substantial price declines for coal could adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations. The cash flows associated with our coal logistics business may decline unless we are able to secure new volumes of coal by attracting additional customers to these operations. Future growth and profitability of our coal logistics business segment will depend, in part, upon whether we can contract for additional coal volumes at a rate greater than that of any decline in volumes from existing customers. Accordingly, decreased demand for coal, or a decrease in the market price of coal, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our coal logistics business.\nOur failure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could materially and adversely affect our ability to secure our reclamation obligations and, therefore, our ability to operate our coal logistics business.\nFederal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, such as reclamation costs, federal and state workers\u2019 compensation costs and other obligations. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand higher fees, additional collateral, including letters of credit, or other terms less favorable to us upon renewals. We are also subject to increases in the amount of surety bonds required by Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and other federal and state laws as these laws, or interpretations of these laws, change. Because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds in place before activities at our coal logistics operations can commence or continue, our failure to maintain (or inability to acquire) these bonds would have a material and adverse impact on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors, including: lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds; restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of future indebtedness; our inability to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the reclamation bonds; and the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew, or to issue, new bonds.\nOur coal logistics business is subject to operating risks, some of which are beyond our control, that could result in a material increase in our operating expenses.\nFactors beyond our control could disrupt our coal logistics operations, adversely affect our ability to service the needs of our customers, and increase our operating costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Such factors could include:\n\u2022\ngeological, hydrologic, or other conditions that may cause damage to infrastructure or personnel;\n\u2022\na major incident that causes all or part of the coal logistics operations at a site to cease for a period of time;\n\u2022\nprocessing and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or snow, flooding, extreme temperatures and other natural events affecting coal logistics operations, transportation, or customers;\nIf any of these conditions or events occur, our coal logistics operations may be disrupted, operating costs could increase significantly, and we could incur substantial losses in this business segment. Disruptions in our coal logistics operations could seriously and adversely affect our financial condition, or results of operations.\nDeterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, or sustained uncertainty in financial markets, may have adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.\nEconomic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate, such as electric power generation and steel making, substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for coal.\n\u2022\ndemand for electricity in the U.S. is impacted by industrial production, which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our coal logistics business;\n\u2022\ndemand for metallurgical coal depends on steel demand in the U.S. and globally, which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our coal logistics business;\n\u2022\nthe tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital for our business including for potential acquisitions, or other growth opportunities.\nRisks Related to Our Coal Mining Business\nCoal prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in prices could adversely affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.\nOur profitability and the value of our coal reserves depend upon the prices we receive for the coal we sell, and such prices depend upon factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign demand and supply for metallurgical coal;\n\u2022\nthe quantity and quality of coal available from domestic and foreign competitors;\n\u2022\nthe demand for steel, which may lead to price fluctuations in the re-pricing of our metallurgical coal contracts;\n\u2022\ncompetition within our industry;\n\u2022\nadverse weather, extreme temperatures, climatic or other natural conditions, including natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic slowdowns;\n\u2022\nlegislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes or changes in energy policy and energy conservation measures that would adversely affect the coal industry, such as legislation limiting carbon emissions; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity and cost of transportation facilities.\nA substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our future coal sales could adversely affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.\nExtensive governmental regulations pertaining to employee health and safety and mandated benefits for retired coal miners impose significant costs on our mining operations, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to matters such as employee health and safety and mandated benefits for retired coal miners. Compliance with these requirements imposes significant costs on us and can result in reduced productivity. Moreover, the possibility exists that new health and safety legislation and/or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially and adversely affect our mining operations. We must compensate employees for work-related injuries. If we do not make adequate provisions for our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities, it could harm our future operating results. In addition, the erosion through tort liability of the protections we are currently provided by workers\u2019 compensation laws could increase our liability for work-related injuries and materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nUnder federal law, each coal mine operator must secure payment of federal black lung benefits to claimants who are current and former employees and contribute to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry before January 1, 1970. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on coal production. If this tax increases, or if we could no longer pass it on to the purchasers of our coal under our coal sales agreements, our operating costs could be increased and our results could be materially and adversely harmed. At December 31, 2014, our liabilities for coal workers\u2019 black lung benefits totaled $43.9 million, which included the estimated impact of PPACA. If new laws or regulations increase the number and award size of claims, it could materially and adversely harm our business. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Legal and Regulatory Requirements-Other Regulatory Requirements.\u201d\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine and may incur fines. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments or the extension of time for delivery or termination of customers\u2019 contracts. Our coal operations also provide substantially all of the coal used at our Jewell cokemaking facility. The inability to deliver the required coal to this facility could significantly impact operations at the facility. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nExtensive environmental regulations impose significant costs on our mining operations, and future regulations could materially increase those costs, impose new or increased liabilities, limit our ability to produce and sell coal, or require us to change our operations significantly, any one or more of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position and/or results of operations.\nOur coal mining operations are subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters such as:\n\u2022\nlimitations on land use;\n\u2022\nmine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nreclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;\n\u2022\nmanagement of materials generated by mining operations;\n\u2022\nthe storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, including with respect to past or legacy mining operations;\n\u2022\nair quality standards;\n\u2022\nwater pollution;\n\u2022\nprotection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species;\n\u2022\nprotection of wetlands;\n\u2022\nthe discharge of materials into the environment;\n\u2022\nthe effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability; and\n\u2022\nthe management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations related to these and other environmental matters can be costly and time-consuming, and could delay commencement or continuation of expansion or\nproduction operations. We may not have been, or may not be, at all times in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. We may incur material costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. If we are pursued for sanctions, costs and liabilities in respect of these matters, our mining operations and, as a result, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nNew legislation or administrative regulations or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations, including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, also may require us to change operations significantly, or incur increased costs. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Legal and Regulatory Requirements\u201d for further information about the various governmental regulations affecting us.\nOur coal mining operations are subject to operating risks, some of which are beyond our control, that could result in a material increase in our operating expenses and a decrease in our production levels.\nFactors beyond our control could disrupt our coal mining operations, adversely affect production and shipments and increase our operating costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Such factors could include:\n\u2022\npoor mining conditions resulting from geological, hydrologic or other conditions that may cause damage to nearby infrastructure or mine personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in the thickness and quality of coal seams, and variations in the amounts of rock and other natural materials overlying the coal being mined;\n\u2022\na major incident at a mine site that causes all or part of the operations of the mine to cease for some period of time;\n\u2022\nmining, processing and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u2022\nadverse weather, extreme temperatures, and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or snow, flooding and other natural events affecting operations, transportation or customers;\n\u2022\nunexpected or accidental surface subsidence from underground mining;\n\u2022\naccidental mine water discharges, fires, explosions or similar mining accidents; and\n\u2022\ncompetition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas, such as coalbed methane extraction.\nIf any of these conditions or events occur, our coal mining operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or shipments, operating costs could increase significantly, and we could incur substantial losses. In particular, our Jewell cokemaking facility currently obtains essentially all of its metallurgical coal requirements from our existing coal mining operations. Disruptions in our coal mining operations, resulting in decreased production of metallurgical coal, could seriously and adversely affect production at our Jewell cokemaking facility.\nIf transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomical for our customers, it may impair our ability to sell coal, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal and the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs and the lack of sufficient rail and port capacity could lead to reduced coal sales. For example, all of our coal mining operations are substantially dependent on, and only have access to, a single rail provider. A substantial amount of the metallurgical coal produced from our coal mining operations is used in our adjacent Jewell cokemaking facility. However, future disruption of transportation services (due to weather-related problems, infrastructure damage, strikes, lock-outs, lack of fuel or maintenance items, underperformance of port and rail infrastructure, congestion and balancing systems used to manage vessel queuing and demurrage, transportation delays or other reasons) may temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to other customers and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face numerous uncertainties in estimating economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in estimates may result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nOur future performance depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our estimates of our proven and probable coal reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. We base our estimates of reserves on engineering, economic and geological data assembled, analyzed and reviewed by internal and third-party engineers and consultants. We update our estimates of the quantity and quality of proven and probable coal reserves as needed to reflect production of coal from the reserves, updated geological models and mining recovery data, tonnage contained in newly acquired lease areas and estimated costs of production and sales prices.\nThere are numerous factors and assumptions that affect economically recoverable reserve estimates, including:\n\u2022\nquality of the coal;\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;\n\u2022\nthe percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, taxes, including severance and excise taxes and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning the timing for the development of the reserves; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning equipment and productivity, future coal prices, operating costs, including costs for critical supplies such as fuel and tires, capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs.\nEach of these factors may vary considerably. As a result, estimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, estimated cost of production, and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary materially due to changes in the foregoing factors and assumptions. Therefore, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues and/or higher than expected costs.\nOur inability to develop coal reserves in an economically feasible manner could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue developing economically recoverable coal reserves. If we fail to develop additional coal reserves, our existing reserves eventually will be depleted. We may not be able to obtain replacement reserves when we require them. Replacement reserves may not be available or, if available, may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines. Our ability to develop coal reserves in the future also may be limited by the availability of cash we generate from our operations or available financing, restrictions under our existing or future financing arrangements, the lack of suitable opportunities or the inability to acquire coal properties or leases on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to develop replacement reserves, our future production may decrease significantly and this may have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\nMining in Central Appalachia is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the U.S., which could affect our mining operations and cost structures in these areas.\nOur coal mines are located in Virginia and West Virginia, in what is known as the Central Appalachian region. The geological characteristics of Central Appalachian coal reserves, such as coal seam thickness, make them complex and costly to mine. As compared to mines in other regions, permitting, licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements are more costly and time consuming to satisfy. These factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of coal produced at our mines in Central Appalachia.\nA defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain property could limit our ability to mine our coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our coal mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated coal reserves. We may not verify title to our leased properties or associated coal reserves until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. In some cases, the seller or lessor warrants property title. In other cases, separate title confirmation may not be required for leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously. Our right to mine some of our reserves may be adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist, or if our leasehold interests are subject to superior property rights of third parties. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where such defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and require us to pay minimum production royalties. Our inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate. In addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate new leases for properties containing additional reserves, or maintain our leasehold interests in properties where we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease.\nDisruptions in the quantities of coal produced by our contract mine operators could impair our ability to fill customer orders or increase our operating costs.\nWe use independent contractors to mine coal at certain of our mining operations. Some of our contract miners may experience adverse geologic mining conditions, operational difficulties, escalated costs, financial difficulties or other factors beyond our control that could affect the availability, pricing and quality of coal produced for us. In addition, market volatility\nand price increases for coal or freight could result in non-performance by third-party suppliers under existing contracts with us, in order to take advantage of the higher prices in the current market. Disruptions in the quantities of coal produced by independent contractors for us could impair our ability to supply our cokemaking facilities and to fill our customer orders. Our profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships such as these depends upon the reliability of the supply or the ability to substitute, when economical, third-party coal sources, with internal production or coal purchased in the market and other factors. Non-performance by contract miners may adversely affect our ability to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements. If we are unable to fill a customer order, or if we are required to purchase coal from other sources in order to satisfy a customer order, we could lose existing customers and our operating costs could increase.\nWe require a skilled workforce to run our coal mining business. If we or our contractors cannot hire qualified people to meet replacement or expansion needs, our labor costs may increase and we may not be able to achieve planned results.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled workers in multiple disciplines, including experienced foremen, electricians, equipment operators, engineers and welders, among others. Our future success depends greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We have an aging workforce, and an extended effort to recruit new employees to replace those who retire or a sustained shortage of skilled labor in the areas in which we operate could make it difficult to meet our staffing needs or result in higher labor rates. We also may be forced to hire novice miners, who are required to be accompanied by experienced workers as a safety precaution. These measures could adversely affect our productivity and operating costs. A lack of qualified people also may affect companies that we use to perform certain specialized work. If we or our contractors cannot find enough qualified workers, it may delay completion of projects and increase our costs.\nWe have reclamation and mine closure obligations. If the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we may be required to expend significantly greater amounts than anticipated.\nThe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. We accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. Furthermore, our reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are unfunded. If these accruals are insufficient, or our cash requirements in a particular year are greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could materially and adversely affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations and, therefore, our ability to mine or lease coal.\nOur reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are unfunded. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, such as mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers\u2019 compensation costs, coal leases and other obligations. These bonds are typically renewable annually. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand higher fees, additional collateral, including letters of credit or other terms less favorable to us upon those renewals. We are also subject to increases in the amount of surety bonds required by federal and state laws as these laws, or interpretations of these laws, change. Because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds in place before mining can commence or continue, our failure to maintain (or inability to acquire) these bonds would have a material and adverse impact on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors, including the following: lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds; restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of future indebtedness; our inability to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the post-mining reclamation bonds; and the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew or issue new bonds.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock or securities or instruments that are convertible into our capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, shares that may be issued to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans, shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock and securities and instruments that are convertible into our common stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, likely would result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and by other factors.\nAny declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock are limited by restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, and will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nFurther, we may not have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends in the future. The absence of sufficient surplus may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures or increases in reserves.\nProvisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na Board of Directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\naction by written consent of stockholders may only be taken unanimously by holders of all our shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the right of stockholders to remove directors; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to be acquired.\nThe DGCL also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe that these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is in our best interests and that of our stockholders.\nAny or all of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nA person or group could establish a substantial position in SunCoke Energy, Inc. stock.\nWe do not have a shareholder rights plan which may make it easier for a person or group to acquire a substantial position in SunCoke Energy, Inc. stock. Such person or group may have interests adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history as a separate public company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nOur historical financial information for the periods ended prior to the Separation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Sunoco. Accordingly, the historical financial information included here does not necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, our business was operated by Sunoco as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Sunoco or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, including, but not limited to, legal services, treasury, accounting, auditing, risk management, information technology, human resources, corporate affairs, tax administration, certain governance functions (including internal audit and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and external reporting. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Sunoco for these and similar functions. These allocations are likely less than the comparable expenses we believe we would have incurred had we operated as a separate public company.\n\u2022\nPreviously, our business was integrated with the other businesses of Sunoco. Historically, we have shared economies of scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. While we entered into transition agreements with Sunoco in connection with the Separation that govern certain commercial and other relationships between us, those transitional arrangements may not fully capture the benefits our businesses have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other businesses of Sunoco. The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\n\u2022\nGenerally, prior to the Separation, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the enterprise-wide cash management policies of Sunoco. In connection with the Separation and the IPO, we obtained financing in the form of our credit facilities and notes. In the future, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.\n\u2022\nThe cost of capital for our business may be higher than Sunoco\u2019s cost of capital prior to the Separation. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a public company separate from Sunoco. The adjustments and allocations we have made in preparing our historical consolidated financial statements may not appropriately reflect our operations during those periods as if we had in fact operated as a stand-alone entity, or what the actual effect of our Separation from Sunoco will be.\nRisks Related to Our Master Limited Partnership\nWe own a significant equity interest in the Partnership.\nWe own the general partner of the Partnership, which consists of a 2 percent ownership interest and incentive distribution rights, and we currently own a 54.0 percent interest in the Partnership. The Partnership holds a 98 percent interest in each of two entities that own our Haverhill, Ohio and Middletown, Ohio cokemaking facilities and related assets, and also holds a 75 percent interest in the entity that owns our Granite City, Illinois cokemaking facility and related assets. All of the Partnership\u2019s coke sales are made pursuant to long-term take-or-pay agreements, and our financial statements include the consolidated results of the Partnership. The Partnership is subject to operating and regulatory risks which are substantially similar to our own. The occurrence of any of these risks could directly or indirectly affect the Partnership\u2019s, as well as our, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as the Partnership is a consolidated subsidiary. For additional information about the Partnership, see \u201cCokemaking Operations\u201d and \u201cFormation of a Master Limited Partnership\u201d in Business and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results (Items 1 and 7), respectively.\nWe derive a portion of our cash flows from the quarterly cash distributions we receive due to our equity ownership interest in the Partnership. If the Partnership is unable to generate sufficient cash flow, its ability to pay quarterly distributions to unitholders (including us) at current levels, or to increase its quarterly distributions in the future, could adversely impact our cash position.\nThe Partnership\u2019s ability to pay quarterly distributions depends primarily on cash flow. The Partnership\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash from operations is largely dependent upon its ability to successfully manage its business which may be affected by economic, financial, competitive, and regulatory factors beyond the Partnership\u2019s control. To the extent the Partnership does not have adequate cash reserves, its ability to pay quarterly distributions to its common unitholders (including us) at current levels, or to increase its quarterly distributions in the future, could be adversely affected. Due to our equity ownership interest in the Partnership, we derive a portion of our cash flows from the quarterly cash distributions we receive. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from the Partnership at current or increased levels, our cash position could be adversely affected.\nWe are party to an omnibus agreement with the Partnership that exposes us to various risks and uncertainties.\nIn connection with the initial public offering of the Partnership and the related contribution to the Partnership of an interest in each of our Haverhill, Ohio and Middletown, Ohio cokemaking facilities, we entered into an omnibus agreement with the Partnership. This omnibus agreement was later amended in connection with the contribution to the Partnership of an interest in our Granite City, Illinois cokemaking assets. Pursuant to this omnibus agreement, we have agreed to grant the Partnership preferential rights to pursue certain growth opportunities we identify in the U.S. and Canada and a right of first offer to acquire certain of our cokemaking assets located in the U.S. and Canada for so long as we control the Partnership\u2019s general partner. In addition, pursuant to this agreement, we have agreed, for a period of five years from the closing of the initial public offering, to make the Partnership whole, in certain circumstances, to the extent of a customer\u2019s failure to satisfy its obligations or to the extent a customer\u2019s obligations are reduced. Additionally, pursuant to this agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the Partnership for certain environmental remediation projects costs arising prior to the contribution of the interests in the Haverhill, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio and Granite City, Illinois cokemaking facilities. The omnibus agreement further provides that we will fully indemnify the Partnership with respect to certain tax liabilities arising prior to, or in connection\nwith, the contribution of the interests in the Haverhill, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio and Granite City, Illinois cokemaking facilities, and that we will cure or fully indemnify the Partnership for losses resulting from certain title defects at the properties owned by the Partnership or its subsidiaries. Our obligations and the extent of our exposures that may arise under the omnibus agreement are subject to various contingencies and cannot be estimated with certainty at this time.\nThe tax treatment of the Partnership depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) treats the Partnership as a corporation or it becomes subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes, it would substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including SunCoke Energy.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of SunCoke Energy\u2019s investment in the common units of the Partnership depends largely on the Partnership being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership has not requested, and does not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this matter. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the ones the Partnership has taken. A successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions the Partnership takes may impact adversely the market for its common units, and the costs of any IRS contest will reduce the Partnership\u2019s cash available for distribution to unitholders, including SunCoke Energy. If the Partnership was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it would pay federal income tax at the corporate tax rate, and likely would pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to unitholders, including SunCoke Energy, generally would be taxed again as corporate distributions. Treatment of the Partnership as a corporation would result in a material reduction in its anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to unitholders, including SunCoke Energy. Current law may change so as to cause the Partnership to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or to otherwise subject it to a material level of entity level taxation. States are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. If any of these states were to impose a tax on the Partnership, the cash available for distribution to unitholders, including SunCoke Energy, would be reduced.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in the Partnership\u2019s common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including the Partnership, or an investment in its common units, may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively. Moreover, any such modification could make it more difficult or impossible for the Partnership to meet the exception which allows publicly traded partnerships that generate qualifying income to be treated as partnerships (rather than corporations) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, affect or cause us to change our business activities, or affect the tax consequences of an investment in its common units. For example, members of Congress have been considering substantive changes to the definition of qualifying income and the treatment of certain types of income earned from partnerships. While these specific proposals would not appear to affect the treatment of the Partnership as a partnership, we are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of SunCoke Energy\u2019s investment in the Partnership\u2019s common units.", "PERMNO": 12905, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "SXC"}
