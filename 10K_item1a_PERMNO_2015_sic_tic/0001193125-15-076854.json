{"cik": "105319", "company": "WEIGHT WATCHERS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition from other weight management industry participants or the development of more effective or more favorably perceived weight management methods could result in decreased demand for our services and products.\nThe weight management industry is highly competitive. We compete against a wide range of providers of weight management services and products. Our competitors include: surgical procedures; the pharmaceutical industry; self-help weight management regimens and other self-help weight management products, services and publications, such as books, magazines and websites; commercial weight management programs; Internet, free mobile and other weight management applications, activity monitors and other electronic weight management approaches; dietary supplements and meal replacement products; healthy lifestyle services, products and publications; weight management services administered by doctors, nutritionists and dieticians; government agencies and non-profit groups that offer weight management services; fitness centers and national drug store chains. Additional competitors may emerge as new or different products or methods of weight management are developed and marketed. More effective or more favorably perceived diet and weight management methods, including pharmaceutical treatments, fat and sugar substitutes or other technological and scientific advancements in weight management methods, also may be developed. This competition may reduce demand for our services and products.\nThe purchasing decisions of weight management consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image, marketing programs, cost, consumer trends and perception of the efficacy of the service and product offerings. Moreover, consumers can, and frequently do, change weight management approaches easily and at little cost. For example, our revenue was adversely affected by increased popularity and media exposure of low-carbohydrate diets in 2003 and 2004, and more recently, by the popularity of mobile technology, which has led to increased trial of free mobile and other weight management applications and activity monitors. Any decrease in demand for our services and products may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to develop innovative new services and products or if our services and products do not continue to appeal to the market, or if we are unable to successfully expand into new channels of distribution or respond to consumer trends, our business may suffer.\nThe weight management industry is subject to changing consumer demands based, in large part, on the efficacy and popular appeal of weight management programs. The popularity of weight management programs is dependent, in part, on their ease of use, cost and channels of distribution as well as consumer trends. For example, the increasing focus of consumers on more integrated lifestyle and fitness approaches rather than just food, nutrition and diet could adversely impact the popularity of our programs. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and market new, innovative services and products and to enhance our existing services and products, each on a timely basis to respond to new and evolving consumer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, weight management, technological and other developments. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced services and products, and we cannot assure you that any new or enhanced services or products will appeal to the market. Our future success also will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully distribute our products and services through appealing channels of distribution, such as mobile. Our failure to develop new services and products and\nto enhance our existing services and products, the failure of our services and products to continue to appeal to the market or the failure to expand into appealing new channels of distribution could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain members and subscribers and thus adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement new strategic initiatives, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe are continuously evaluating changing consumer preferences and the competitive environment of our industry and seeking out opportunities to improve our performance through the implementation of selected strategic initiatives, such as our healthcare initiative. The goal of these efforts is to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy which addresses the continuing changes in the weight management industry environment and our position within the industry. For example, as the healthcare industry continues to evolve its response to the obesity epidemic so do the requirements, both regulatory and business, for providers. If we do not successfully meet these requirements, we may not be perceived as an appropriate partner for certain purposes. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic initiatives and realize the intended business opportunities, growth prospects, including new business channels, and competitive advantages. Our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities may not bring the intended results. Assumptions underlying expected financial results or consumer demand may not be met or economic conditions may deteriorate. We also may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel to implement our strategic initiatives. If these or other factors limit our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives, our business activities, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs, as well as the strength of our social media presence, to attract and retain members and subscribers.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract and retain members to our meetings and subscribers to our Online products. Our ability to attract and retain members and subscribers depends significantly on the effectiveness of our marketing practices. From time to time, we use the success stories of our members and subscribers, including in some cases celebrities, in our marketing and advertising programs to communicate on a personal level with consumers. Actions taken by these members and subscribers that harm their personal reputation, or include the cessation of using our services and products, could have an adverse impact on the marketing and advertising campaigns in which they are featured. We also use social media channels as a means of communicating with consumers. Unauthorized or inappropriate use of these channels could result in harmful publicity or negative consumer experience which could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our marketing in these channels. In addition, substantial negative commentary by others on social media platforms could have an adverse impact on our reputation and ability to attract and retain members and subscribers. If our marketing and advertising campaigns do not generate a sufficient number of members and subscribers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe Weight Watchers brand could be impaired due to actions taken by our franchisees, licensees and suppliers.\nWe believe that the Weight Watchers brand, including its widespread recognition and strong reputation in the market, is one of our most valuable assets and that it provides us with a competitive advantage. Our franchisees operate their businesses under our brand. In addition, we license the Weight Watchers brand to third parties for the manufacture and sale in retail stores by such parties of a variety of goods, including food products, and also endorse third-party branded consumer products. We also sell in our meeting rooms food and non-food products manufactured by third-party suppliers. Because our franchisees, licensees and suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them, including violations of generally accepted ethical business practices or breaches of law or contractual obligations, such as not following our program or not maintaining our quality and safety standards, could harm our brand. Also, Weight Watchers products may be\nsubject to product recalls, litigation or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased meeting attendance, Online product subscriptions and product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.\nOur debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, and the restrictions of our debt covenants could impede our operations and flexibility.\nAs of January 3, 2015, our total debt was $2,358.0 million. In addition, at January 3, 2015, we had $48.2 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our debt consists entirely of variable-rate instruments so we are subject to the risk of higher interest rates. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rates through interest rate swaps. At the end of fiscal 2014, we had in effect an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $1.5 billion.\nWhile there is no net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) leverage ratio maintenance requirement on our $2,358.0 million of debt outstanding, our credit facilities contain customary covenants, including covenants that in certain circumstances restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on and redeem capital stock, make other payments, including investments, sell our assets and enter into consolidations, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the credit facilities. If an event of default exists under the credit facilities, the lenders could elect to cease making loans and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders under the credit facilities accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any such acceleration.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy these obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our future performance, which may be affected by financial, business, economic, demographic and other factors, such as attitudes toward weight management and pressure from our competitors. We have a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million that will mature in April 2016. We expect to satisfy our debt obligations with respect to this April 2016 maturity with cash flows from operating activities, and, if needed, from borrowing available under our revolving credit facility. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve a level of cash flows from operating activities in an amount sufficient for us to meet this obligation.\nWe also have a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion that will mature in April 2020. We expect to pay the principal and interest due in April 2020 from a combination of our cash flows provided by operating activities and by opportunistically using other means to repay or refinance our obligations as we determine appropriate. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on all of our outstanding debt. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We also may not be able to secure future borrowings under our WWI Credit Facility (as defined below) or otherwise to fund our planned capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs.\nAny refinancing, if available on acceptable terms or at all, of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nAny failure of our technology or systems to perform satisfactorily could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on software, hardware, network systems and similar technology, including cloud-based technology, that is either developed by us or licensed from or maintained by third parties to operate our websites, Online\nsubscription product offerings and other products and services such as the recurring billing system associated with certain of our commitment plans, and to support our business operations. As much of this technology is complex, there may be future errors, defects or performance problems, including when we update our technology or integrate new technology to expand and enhance our capabilities. Our technology may malfunction or suffer from defects that become apparent only after extended use. In addition, our operations depend on our ability to protect our information technology systems against damage from fire, power loss, water, earthquakes, telecommunications failures and similar unexpected adverse events. Interruptions in our websites, products and services or network systems could result from unknown technical defects, insufficient capacity or the failure of our third party providers to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. While we maintain disaster recovery capabilities to return to normal operation in a timely manner, we do not have a fully redundant system that includes an instantaneous recovery capability.\nAs a result of such possible defects, failures or other problems, our products and services could be rendered unreliable or be perceived as unreliable by customers, which could result in harm to our reputation and brand. Any failure of our technology or systems could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be required to recognize asset impairment charges for indefinite- and definite-lived assets.\nIn accordance with GAAP (as defined hereafter), we perform impairment reviews of our indefinite-lived assets, which include franchise rights acquired and goodwill, on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. We also continually evaluate whether current factors or indicators, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, an increased competitive environment, a decline in our financial performance, and/or other prevailing conditions in the capital markets, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets. The process of testing franchise rights acquired, goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty. Certain factors, including the future profitability of our businesses, the price of our stock and macroeconomic conditions, might have a negative impact on the fair value of these assets. In fiscal 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $26.1 million related to franchise rights acquired in connection with our Canada operations. In fiscal 2013, we recorded impairment charges in the aggregate of approximately $1.2 million related to franchise rights acquired in connection with our Mexico and Hong Kong operations. We may incur additional impairment charges in the future, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we evaluate definite-lived assets, both tangible, which includes our physical plant and equipment, and intangible, which includes both internally developed and purchased software, for impairment by comparing the net realizable value of the asset to the carrying value of the capitalized cost. If the value of those assets is not deemed to be recoverable an assessment of the fair value of those assets is performed and to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value an impairment charge is recognized. Should our investment in capitalized definite-lived assets become impaired, there would also be an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to renew certain of our licenses, or the inability to do so on terms that are favorable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have entered into licensing and endorsement relationships with numerous partners for the distribution and sale of certain products that are relevant and helpful to weight-conscious consumers. These arrangements are typically for fixed terms, following which the parties decide whether to extend the term of the arrangement. There is no guarantee that we will reach mutually agreeable terms with our partners for extending an arrangement. Similarly, in those instances where a licensee enjoys the option to extend the term of a license as a result of having achieved certain conditions, there is no guarantee that the licensee will avail itself of such option. Our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to extend a licensing or endorsement arrangement, if we are unable to do so on terms favorable to us, or if we cannot locate a suitable alternative to an incumbent licensee who has decided not to renew its arrangement.\nExpiration or early termination by us of leases could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur operations, including corporate headquarters and back-office and customer service operations, are located in leased office space and many of our meetings are held in leased space in retail centers. As leases expire, we may not be able to renew them on acceptable terms or secure suitable replacement locations. If we decide to relocate or close meeting locations before the expiration of the applicable lease term, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or \u201cbuy out\u201d the remaining term of the lease. Either of the above events could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur international operations expose us to economic, political and social risks in the countries in which we operate.\nThe international nature of our operations involves a number of risks, including changes in US and foreign government regulations, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate and our dependence on foreign personnel. Foreign government regulations may also restrict our ability to operate in some countries, acquire new businesses, recur bill our customers or repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries back to the United States. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter and successfully compete in additional foreign markets or that we will be able to continue to compete in the foreign markets in which we currently operate.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks from our international operations that could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant portion of our revenues and operating costs are denominated in foreign currencies. We are therefore exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the currencies in which our foreign operations receive revenues and pay expenses. We do not currently hedge, and have not historically hedged, our operational exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our consolidated financial results are presented in US dollars and therefore, during times of a strengthening US dollar, our reported international revenues and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer US dollars. In addition, the assets and liabilities of our non-US subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are recorded in shareholders\u2019 equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments arising from intercompany receivables with our foreign subsidiaries are generally recorded as a component of other expense (income). Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our revenues, operating costs, net income and shareholders\u2019 equity to fluctuate, and are expected to have a negative impact in 2015.\nWe may not successfully make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures and we may not successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits of such businesses.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue selected acquisitions or joint ventures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effect these transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any future acquisitions or joint ventures may require access to additional capital, and we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we enter into these transactions, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate or we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, technologies and products into our existing business or in providing our services and products in newly acquired markets; attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses; significant charges or expenses; higher costs of integration than we anticipated; or unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations.\nOur ability to influence the control of, or distributions from, our joint ventures may be limited by contract or otherwise. If any of the other investors in one of our joint ventures fails to observe its commitments, or its interests are different than ours, the joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan, we\nmay be required to increase our level of commitment, or such entities may take actions which are not in our best interest. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our joint venture partners, we could lose our ability to operate in the geographies and/or markets in which they operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing shareholders.\nOur business may decline as a result of a downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence.\nOur business is highly dependent on meeting fees, Online product subscriptions and product sales. A downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence in any of our major markets could result in people curtailing or reallocating their discretionary spending which, in turn, could reduce attendance at our meetings, Online product subscriptions and product sales. Any reduction in consumer spending may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe seasonal nature of our business could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. The first quarter of the fiscal year typically results in the greatest revenue due to the importance of the winter diet season to our overall recruitment environment. This seasonality could cause our share price to fluctuate as the results of an interim financial period may not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis.\nAny event that discourages or impedes people from gathering with others or accessing resources could adversely affect our business.\nOur meetings and Online businesses are subject to conditions beyond our control that may prevent or impede current or prospective members from attending or joining meetings, or subscribers from accessing our Online products, including extreme weather, terrorism, health epidemics, loss of resources such as electricity, national disasters and other extraordinary events. The occurrence of any event that discourages people from gathering with others or impedes their ability to access resources could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThird parties may infringe on our brand and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade dress, trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws and domain name dispute resolution systems to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims.\nThird parties may make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenues or our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.\nOur reputation and the appeal of our services and product offerings may be harmed by security breaches or privacy concerns.\nBreaches of security, vandalism and other malicious acts, which are increasingly negatively impacting companies, could result in unauthorized access to proprietary or customer information or data, including credit card transaction data, or cause interruptions to our products and services. Such unauthorized access could harm our reputation, expose us to liability claims and may result in the loss of existing or potential customers. We rely upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and utilize confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal customer information and data), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information as well as comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe also have outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to security breaches. While we have invested and developed systems and processes designed to protect such proprietary or customer information or data, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches.\nMost states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information, and additional states and governmental entities are considering such laws. In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed. Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our websites or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our websites or purchasing our services or products.\nIn addition, the transmission of computer viruses, or similar malware, could adversely affect our information technology systems and harm our business operations. As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and other resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by security breaches. These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a sufficient remedy.\nOutcomes of litigation or regulatory actions could adversely impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business operations. For example, in the past, we have had disputes with our franchisees regarding operations and other contractual issues. Due to the inherent uncertainties of legal actions and regulatory proceedings, we cannot predict their outcomes with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal or regulatory actions.\nAs we expand our offerings in certain healthcare channels, consumers may misconstrue our program as providing medical advice. As we clearly state in our consumer communications, most of our service providers do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields beyond the training they receive from us. Despite our disclaimers, as more customers come to us through the healthcare channel they may misperceive that our service providers are providing medical advice regarding weight loss and related topics. We may also be subject to claims that our service providers have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers when needed. Regardless of the outcome of any legal action or regulatory proceeding, such actions and proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that our management devote substantial time and resources to defend us.\nOur businesses are subject to legislative and regulatory restrictions.\nA number of laws and regulations govern our advertising, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, licensees, franchisees, employees and other service providers, and government authorities in the countries in which we operate.\nCertain federal, state and foreign agencies, such as the FTC and FDA, regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, promotions, packaging, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements, and other consumer protection matters. A determination by a federal, state or foreign agency, or a court in connection with a governmental enforcement action or private litigation, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions of our business operations. For example, during the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials, claims for program success and program costs. In 1997, we entered into a consent order with the FTC settling all contested issues raised in the complaint filed against us. The consent order requires us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of products and services.\nSince we operate both in the United States and internationally, we are subject to many distinct employment, labor, benefits and tax laws in each country in which we operate, including regulations affecting our employment practices and our relations with our employees and service providers. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, or are subject to litigation with respect to these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLaws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and continue to evolve. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.\nFuture laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, consumer pricing and billing arrangements, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, licensees or franchisees, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.\nLoss of key personnel or failure to effectively manage and motivate our workforce could negatively impact our sales of services and products.\nWe depend on senior management and other key personnel, and the loss of certain personnel could result in the loss of management continuity and institutional knowledge. We also depend heavily upon our service providers to support our members and subscribers on their weight management efforts. If we fail to appropriately manage and motivate our service providers, we may not be able to adequately service our customers which could negatively impact our sales of services and products. Changes in factors such as overall unemployment levels, local competition for qualified personnel, prevailing wage rates, changes in employment law, as well as rising\nemployee benefits costs, including insurance in the areas in which we operate, could interfere with our ability to adequately provide support to customers and increase our labor costs. Additionally, our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could delay or hinder our successfully executing our strategic initiatives.\nArtal controls us and may have conflicts of interest with other shareholders in the future.\nArtal controls us and is able to control the election and removal of our directors and determine our corporate and management policies, including potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales, the amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of our ownership may delay or deter possible changes in control of our company, which may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock. Even if Artal beneficially owns less than 50% but 10% or more of our common stock, Artal will have the right pursuant to an agreement with us to nominate directors to our Board of Directors in proportion to its stock ownership. The interests of Artal may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nArtal controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Under the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and such a company may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, (3) the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, (4) that the compensation committee be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisors and (5) the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. We have elected to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Accordingly, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and Virginia corporate law contain provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the laws of Virginia, the state in which we are incorporated, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our shareholders. Thus, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. In addition, a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89244, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "WW"}
