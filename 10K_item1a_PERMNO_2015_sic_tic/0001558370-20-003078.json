{"cik": "1738827", "company": "KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties, which we believe are the principal risks that we face and of which we are currently aware, and all of the other information in this Form 10-K. Some of the risks and uncertainties described below relate to our business, while others relate to the spin-off. Other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nIf any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe serve customers who are involved in drilling for and production of oil and natural gas. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, is currently experiencing a significant downturn and has experienced additional significant downturns in recent years, which are currently significantly affecting, and have in recent years significantly affected, the performance of our business. Additional adverse developments affecting this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are primarily generated from customers who are engaged in drilling for and production of oil and natural gas. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and subject to sudden and significant volatility, and we depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make capital and operating expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. Additionally, developments that adversely affect oil and natural gas drilling and production services could reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to make such expenditures and\nmaterially reduce our customers\u2019 demand for our services and associated product offerings, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe predominant factor that would reduce demand for our services and associated product offerings would be a reduction in land-based drilling activity in the continental United States.\nIn recent years, the oil and gas industry has experienced significant downturns. For example, the oilfield service industry experienced an abrupt deterioration in demand during the second half of 2019, which led to a sharp decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in operating frac spreads from the second quarter through the end of 2019. These downturns placed unprecedented pressure on both our customers and competitors.\nOil prices declined sharply in March 2020 to levels as low as approximately $21 per barrel as a result of multiple factors affecting levels of supply and demand in global oil and gas markets, including the announcement of price reductions and production increases by OPEC members and other oil exporting nations. Oil and natural gas prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of the near term production increases and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and as changes in oil and natural gas inventories, industry demand and national and economic performance are reported, and we cannot predict when prices will improve and stabilize.\nWorldwide political, economic and military events as well as natural disasters and global or national health pandemics, epidemics or concerns and other factors beyond our control contribute to oil and natural gas price levels and volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Current levels in the price of natural gas, oil or natural gas liquids, as well as ongoing volatility, have had an adverse impact on the level of drilling and E&P activity, which could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services and the rates we are able to charge for our services. We negotiate the rates payable under our contracts based on prevailing market rates, and the rates we are able to charge will fluctuate with market conditions. Furthermore, future higher commodity prices may not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity because our customers\u2019 expectations of future prices also influence their activity. Lower industry demand for oilfield services may persist for a significant period, which would materially adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge and the demand for our services. Additionally, we may incur costs and have downtime any time our customers\u2019 activities are refocused towards different drilling regions.\nSignificant factors that are likely to affect commodity prices in current and future periods include, but are not limited to, the extent and duration of price reductions and increased production by OPEC members and other oil exporting nations, the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies, U.S. and global economic conditions, U.S. and global political and economic developments, including the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and resulting energy and environmental policies, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and conditions in the U.S. oil and gas industry and the resulting demand for domestic land oilfield services. The reduction in oil prices and the ongoing effects of the global COVID-19 outbreaks will likely result in a global recession, with the possibility of numerous bankruptcies of E&P companies and oilfield services companies during 2020 and a significant decline in demand and prices for oilfield services during 2020. We have taken, and are continuing to take, steps to reduce costs, including reductions in capital expenditures, as well as other workforce rightsizing and ongoing cost initiatives.\nAnother factor that would reduce the level of drilling and production activity is increased government regulation of that activity. Our customers\u2019 drilling and production operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulations concerning: emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases; hydraulic fracturing; the handling of oil and natural gas and byproducts thereof and other materials and substances used in connection with oil and natural gas operations, including drilling fluids and wastewater; well spacing; production limitations; plugging and abandonment of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. More stringent legislation or regulation (including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate the oil and natural gas industry), a moratorium on drilling or hydraulic fracturing, or increased taxation of oil and natural gas drilling activity could directly curtail such activity or increase the cost of drilling, resulting in reduced levels of drilling activity and therefore reduced demand for our services and associated product offerings.\nSpending by E&P companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause E&P companies to make\nadditional reductions to capital budgets in the future. Cuts in capital spending would likely curtail drilling and completion programs as well as discretionary spending on well construction services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our services. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, including with respect to environmental matters, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have an impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. An adverse development in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our customers\u2019 operations or financial condition, which could in turn result in reduced demand for our services and associated product offerings.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to undertake drilling and completion spending.\nOther factors over which we have no control that could affect our customers\u2019 willingness to undertake drilling and completion spending activities include:\n\u00b7\nthe level of prices, and expectations about prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe level of domestic and global oil and natural gas production;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, pricing and perceived safety of pipeline, trucking, train storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u00b7\nthe supply of and demand for oilfield services and equipment;\n\u00b7\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u00b7\nthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7\nfederal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as E&P activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions, including rain, tropical storms, hurricanes and severe cold weather, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u00b7\noil refining capacity;\n\u00b7\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of water resources and suitable proppants in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms for use in hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, capacity and cost of disposal and recycling services for used hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u00b7\nthe political environment in oil and natural gas producing regions, including uncertainty or instability resulting from civil disorder, terrorism or war;\n\u00b7\nworldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nglobal or national health pandemics, epidemics or concerns, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, which have reduced and may further reduce demand for oil and natural gas and related products due to reduced global or national economic activity;\n\u00b7\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members and other state controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production levels, including announcements of potential changes to such levels;\n\u00b7\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nactivities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas; and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. We cannot predict the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services, and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks.\nConditions inherent in the oil and natural gas industry can cause personal injury or loss of life, disruption or suspension in operations, damage to geological formations, damage to facilities, substantial revenue loss, business interruption and damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment and the environment. Our operations are subject to many hazards and risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nequipment defects;\n\u00b7\naccidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property;\n\u00b7\ndamaged or lost equipment;\n\u00b7\nliabilities from accidents or damage by our operators or equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other damage to the environment;\n\u00b7\nwell blowouts and the uncontrolled flow of natural gas, oil or other well fluids into or through the environment, including onto or into the ground or into the atmosphere, groundwater, surface water or an underground formation;\n\u00b7\nfires, explosions and cratering;\n\u00b7\nmechanical or technological failures;\n\u00b7\nloss of well control;\n\u00b7\nspillage handling and disposing of materials;\n\u00b7\ncollapse of the boreholes;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions; and\n\u00b7\nfailure of our employees to comply with our internal environmental, health and safety guidelines.\nIf any of these hazards materialize, they could result in the suspension of operations, termination of contracts without compensation, damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others, or injury or death to our personnel or third-parties and could expose us to substantial liability or losses. Although we customarily include a waiver of consequential damages in our customer contracts, defects or other performance problems in the services that we offer or products we offer could result in our customers seeking to invalidate such waiver and seek damages from us for losses associated with these defects or other performance problems. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. Our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable or otherwise experience material defects in our products or performance problems, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue, and any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation with our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. In addition, these risks may be greater for us upon the acquisition of another company that has not allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and has a poor safety record.\nWe maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against most potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, especially as the inherent risks in our operations increase with increasing well complexity, and we are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business. For example, although we are insured for environmental pollution resulting from certain environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, we may not be insured against all environmental accidents or events that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some\ninstances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.\nOur insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The current trend in the insurance industry is towards larger deductibles and self-insured retentions. In addition, insurance may not be available in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, compelling us to have larger deductibles or self-insured retentions to effectively manage expenses. As a result, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities or situations where we have high deductibles or self-insured retentions that expose us to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, oilfield services companies have been the subject of a significant volume of wage and hour-related litigation, including claims brought under the Federal Labor Standards Act, in which employee pay practices have been challenged. We have been named as defendants in these lawsuits, and we do not maintain insurance for alleged wage and hour-related litigation. Some of these cases remain outstanding and are in various stages of negotiation and/or litigation. The frequency and significance of wage- or other employment-related claims may affect expenses, costs and relationships with employees and regulators. Additionally, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon a pool of available skilled employees to operate and maintain our business. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other similar employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide the highest quality service. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited, and a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages thereby increasing our operating costs.\nAlthough our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, union organizational efforts could occur and, if successful, could increase our labor costs. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of groups of our employees could result in increases in the wage rates that we must pay. Likewise, laws and regulations to which we are subject, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. Our operations are also exposed to risks of claims for alleged employment-related liabilities, including risks of claims related to alleged wrongful termination or discrimination, wage payment practices, retaliation claims and other human resource related matters. We cannot assure you that labor costs will not increase. Increases in our labor costs or unavailability of skilled workers could impair our capacity, diminish our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to retain personnel who are key to our operations.\nOur success, among other things, is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified senior management and other key personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. The inability to hire, develop and retain these key employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have operated at a loss, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. As discussed above, current commodity prices and the effects of the COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to result in a global recession with the potential for numerous E&P and oilfield services company bankruptcies and a significant decline in demand and prices for our services in 2020. See \u201c-We serve customers who are involved in drilling for and production of oil and natural gas. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, is currently experiencing a significant downturn and has experienced additional significant downturns in recent years, which are currently significantly\naffecting, and have in recent years significantly affected, the performance of our business. Additional adverse developments affecting this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d We may not be able to reduce our costs or increase our revenues sufficiently to achieve profitability and generate positive operating income. We may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow, which may be significant. We cannot predict the ultimate magnitude or duration of the severe decline in oil and gas prices and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks or when our business may no longer be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nThe reduction in oil prices to current levels and the ongoing effects of the global COVID-19 outbreaks will likely result in a global recession, with the possibility of numerous bankruptcies of E&P companies and oilfield services companies during 2020 and a significant decline in demand and prices for oilfield services during 2020. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased spending by our customers. A prolonged period of economic slowdown and/or recession in the United States, particularly if coupled with a prolonged slowdown in the E&P industry, would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically been both cyclical and seasonal. Activity levels historically have been driven primarily by E&P company capital spending, well completions and workover activity, the geological characteristics of the producing wells and their effect on the services required to commence and maintain production levels, and our customers\u2019 capital and operating budgets. All of these indicators are generally driven by commodity prices, which are affected by both domestic and global supply and demand factors. In particular, while U.S. oil and natural gas prices are correlated with global oil price movements, they are also affected by local market weather and consumption patterns.\nOver the past several years, and particularly during the latter half of 2019, an increasing number of E&P companies increased their focus on generating free cash flow; as a result, if oil prices drop or spending for activities exceeds budgeted amounts earlier in their fiscal years, many E&P companies will sharply curtail spending, which negatively impacts demand for our services. This practice has been commonly referred to as \u201cbudget exhaustion\u201d in the industry. The lack of notice of budget exhaustion negatively impacts our hiring practices and operating efficiencies. As an example, revenues and operating earnings in the first half of Fiscal 2019 were $310.7 million and $13.4 million, respectively, as compared to revenues and operating loss (exclusive of $47.0 million of intangible asset impairment charges) in the second half of Fiscal 2019 of $233.3 million and $(42.1) million, respectively.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital or financing to fund expansion of our asset base, which could increase our financial leverage, or we may not be able to finance our capital needs.\nPrior to the spin-off, we were a segment of KLX, who funded our capital expenditures. In order to expand our asset base, we may need to make significant capital expenditures. If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to organically expand our business operations.\nWe intend to fund our future capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances. To the extent our cash and cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient, we could borrow under our $100.0 million senior secured asset-based lending facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d). Availability under the ABL Facility is determined primarily by a borrowing base formula calculated based on a percentage of our accounts receivable and inventory ($60.0 million as of January 31, 2020). The amount of availability under our ABL Facility will be reduced by the greater of $10.0 million or 15% of the borrowing base during any period for which our fixed charge coverage ratio is not at least 1:1 for the trailing four quarters for which financial statements have been delivered. While our fixed charge coverage ratio exceeded 1:1 for the trailing four quarters ended January 31, 2020, to the extent our Consolidated EBITDA for future quarters declines as compared to the same period in the prior year, such as due to declining revenues from the current ongoing macro-economic factors, our fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing four quarter period may fall below 1:1, in which case, the amount of availability under the ABL Facility would be reduced by the greater of $10.0 million or 15% of the borrowing base until we regain compliance with the 1:1 fixed\ncharge coverage ratio as measured upon the delivery of our quarterly or annual financial statements. If our cash, cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under the ABL Facility are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, we would be required to fund these expenditures through the incurrence of additional debt or the issuance of debt or equity securities or pursue alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring future debt, selling assets or reducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments, such as planned upgrades or acquisitions of equipment and refurbishments of equipment, even if previously publicly announced.\nThe terms of the indenture that governs our 11.5% senior secured notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility and the agreements that will govern any future debt and equity instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If debt and equity capital or alternative financing plans are not available on favorable terms or at all, we would be required to either get the necessary consents to amend the terms of our debt to allow us to pursue additional financing alternatives or curtail our capital spending, and our ability to sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, incurring additional debt would result in increased interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing common stock may result in significant dilution to our current stockholders.\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and trading price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. If we are unable to meet any of the Nasdaq listing requirements in the future, including, for example, if the closing bid price for our common stock falls below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, Nasdaq could determine to delist our common stock. On March 20, 2020, the closing bid price for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market was $0.97. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing or to use our common stock as consideration for acquisitions, decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of the company, and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe face risks from activism against and negative investor sentiment towards the oil and gas industry.\nOpposition towards oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the U.S. Furthermore, certain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and gas industry. Companies in the oil and gas industry have frequently been the target of activist efforts regarding safety, environmental matters, sustainability, human rights and business practices. In addition, some investors, including certain investment advisers, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations have introduced policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector for stated social and environmental considerations. Commercial and investment banks have also faced pressure to stop financing oil and gas production and related projects. Such developments, along with environmental activism and climate change and air pollution initiatives, could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock and may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential oil and gas development projects, which could reduce demand for our services. If activism against oil and gas exploration and production persists or increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or increases in the costs of the equipment we use in our operations could adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe generally do not have specialized tools, trucks or long-term contracts in place that provide for the delivery of equipment, including, but not limited to, replacement parts and other equipment. We could experience delays in the delivery of the equipment that we have ordered and its placement into service due to factors that are beyond our control. Demand by other oilfield services companies and numerous other factors beyond our control could adversely affect our ability to procure equipment that we have not yet ordered or cause the prices of such equipment to increase. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and\nincur higher operating costs. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key goods and services that we use in our operations.\nWe do not have long term contracts with third party suppliers of many of the goods and services used in large volumes in our operations, including manufacturers of technical services equipment and fishing tools, chargers and other tools and equipment used in our operations. If demand for goods and services exceeds supply, such as from disruptions to the supply chain or supplier bankruptcies, the availability of certain goods and services used in our industry decreases and the price of such goods and services increases. We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key goods and services. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2020, based on total purchase cost, our ten largest suppliers of goods and services represented approximately 25% of all such purchases. Our reliance on such suppliers could increase the difficulty of obtaining such goods and services in the event of a disruption to the supply chain or upon a bankruptcy of one or more of these suppliers or upon a shortage in our industry. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to incur higher operating costs. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf suppliers are unable to supply us with the products in our operations in a timely manner, in adequate quantities and/or at a reasonable cost, we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party companies to support our operations through the timely supply of products. Our suppliers may experience capacity constraints that may result in their inability to supply us with products in a timely fashion, with adequate quantities or at a desired price. Factors affecting suppliers can include labor disputes, general economic issues, and changes in raw material and energy costs. Natural disasters such as earthquakes or hurricanes, as well as political instability, global or national health pandemics, epidemics or concerns, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers as well. These factors could lead to increased prices and/or the unfavorable allocation of products by our suppliers, which could reduce our revenues and profit margins and harm our customer relations. Significant disruptions in our supply chain could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to develop, obtain or implement new technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe energy services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling, completion and well intervention techniques using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection or costly to obtain. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to keep pace with technological advancements within our industry. Furthermore, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Thus, limits on our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. These agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity provisions, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in trucking regulations may increase our transportation costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the transportation and relocation of our oilfield services equipment, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. Therefore, we are subject to regulation as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, limits on vehicle weight and size and other matters.\nIn addition, regulations issued by environmental regulators can have an adverse impact on our trucking costs, and therefore, on our results of operations. Environmental Protection Agency regulations limiting exhaust emissions became more restrictive in 2010. In 2010, an executive memorandum was signed directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the \u201cNHTSA\u201d) and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks. In 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA adopted final rules that established fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. These standards apply to model years 2014 to 2018, which are required to achieve an approximate 20% reduction in fuel consumption by model year 2018. In October 2016, the NHTSA and the EPA published new, stricter standards that would apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. As a result of these regulations, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases or rentals and maintenance, an impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of these vehicles and an increase in operating expenses. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes applicable to our trucking operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or government regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers\u2019 costs of doing business, limit the areas in which our customers can operate and reduce oil and natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of any future federal, state or local laws or implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas and oil wells. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas E&P activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed. In addition, regulatory schemes implemented by quasi-governmental entities could be interpreted to prevent us from providing our services in certain jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough hydraulic fracturing currently is generally exempt from regulation under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Underground Injection Control program and is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. These include, among others, a number of regulations issued and other steps taken by the EPA over the last five years, including its New Source Performance Standards issued in 2012, its June 2016 rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants; and the rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands (which was the subject of litigation and which the BLM rescinded in December 2017). While the Trump Administration has generally indicated an interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations that inhibit the development of the U.S. oil and gas industry, it is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of any litigation challenging such implementation, such as the suit the State of California\u2019s attorney general filed in January 2018 challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of its March 2015 rule referred to above.\nMoreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota among others have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular. Some state and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. For example, in December 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division (the \u201cOCC Division\u201d) and the Oklahoma Geologic Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including mitigation, following anomalous seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations, and in February 2017, the OCC Division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce seismic activity in the state. Ongoing lawsuits have also alleged that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. The adoption of more stringent regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and the outcome of litigation over hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety, climate change and the protection of the environment, under which we or our customers may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Changes in such laws or regulations could increase our or our customers\u2019 costs of doing business and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, wetlands, species listed as \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act, the environment, health and safety, waste management, waste disposal and the transportation of waste and other materials. Many of the facilities that are used for our operations are leased, and such leases include varying levels of indemnity obligations to the respective landlords for environmental matters related to our use and occupation of such facilities. Our ongoing operations and our customers\u2019 operations may pose risks of environmental liability, including leakage from operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability, or both. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements affecting oil and gas exploration and completion activities could significantly delay or interrupt our customers\u2019 operations. Increased costs of regulatory compliance, claims for liability or sanctions for noncompliance and related costs could cause us or our customers to incur substantial costs or losses. Clean-up costs and other damages resulting from any contamination-related liabilities and costs associated with changes in and compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in the reduction or discontinuation of our or our customers\u2019 operations and in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for certain large sources of GHGs. While the Trump Administration has announced that the United States will withdraw from international commitments to reduce GHG emissions, it is not clear how this goal will be accomplished, and many state and local officials have announced their commitment to upholding such commitments. Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions could impact our business, any future federal, state or local laws or regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where our customers operate could require our customers to incur increased compliance and operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a\nreduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in our and our customers\u2019 costs for future environmental compliance and remediation.\nWe may be required to assume responsibility for environmental and other liabilities of companies we have acquired or will acquire.\nWe may incur liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our existing, prior or future operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired. We also could be subject to third-party and governmental claims with respect to environmental matters, including claims under CERCLA in instances where we are identified as a potentially responsible party. We believe that indemnities provided to us in certain of our pre-existing acquisition agreements may cover certain environmental conditions existing at the time of the acquisition, subject to certain terms, limitations and conditions. However, if these indemnification provisions terminate or if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their indemnification obligations, we may be subject to liability with respect to the environmental matters that those indemnification provisions address.\nDelays by us or our customers in obtaining permits or the inability by us or our customers to obtain or renew permits could impair our business.\nWe and our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform certain activities. Such permits are typically required by state agencies but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the type of operations, including the location where our customers\u2019 drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. Permitting delays, an inability to obtain or renew permits or revocation of our or our customers\u2019 current permits could cause a loss of revenue and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to maintain existing prices or implement price increases on our services.\nOur ability to maintain our existing prices or to implement price increases depends on our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to pay such prices. As a result and given the volatility in the market, we may not be successful in maintaining our existing prices or, in the future, implementing price increases. As discussed above, current commodity prices and the effects of the COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to result in a global recession and a significant decline in demand and prices for our services in 2020, and we cannot predict the ultimate magnitude or duration of the severe decline in oil and gas prices and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks on the prices we charge. See \u201c-We serve customers who are involved in drilling for and production of oil and natural gas. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, is currently experiencing a significant downturn and has experienced additional significant downturns in recent years, which are currently significantly affecting, and have in recent years significantly affected, the performance of our business. Additional adverse developments affecting this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d The inability to maintain our pricing or to increase our pricing from reduced levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere could also be pressure on our pricing and limitations on our ability to increase prices during future periods of increased market demand when a significant amount of new service capacity, including new well service rigs, wireline units and coiled tubing units, may enter the market. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than\nour ability to raise prices. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. Even if we are able to increase our prices in future periods, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset any rising costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and our failure to compete effectively may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Price competition, equipment availability, location and suitability, experience of the workforce, safety records, reputation, operating integrity and the condition of equipment are all factors used by customers in awarding contracts. Our competitors are numerous and may have greater financial and technological resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers. The competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among E&P companies have reduced the number of available customers and may further increase if E&P company bankruptcies further reduce the number of available customers. The fact that certain oilfield services equipment is mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. In addition, any increase in the supply of hydraulic fracturing fleets could have a material adverse impact on market prices. This increased supply could also require higher capital investment to keep our services competitive.\nSome of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and personnel resources than we do. The larger size of many of our competitors provides them with cost advantages as a result of their economies of scale and their ability to obtain volume discounts and purchase raw materials at lower prices. As a result, such competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and have an advantage over us in pricing as well as securing a sufficient supply of raw materials during times of shortage. Many of our competitors also have better brand name recognition, stronger presence in certain geographic markets, more established distribution networks, larger customer bases, more in-depth knowledge of the target markets, and the ability to provide a much broader array of services. Some of our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the research and development, promotion and sale of their services and products and better withstand the evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions as compared to us. Our operations may be adversely affected if our competitors introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices or other characteristics than our products and services or expand into service areas where we operate. Our operations may also be adversely affected if our competitors are able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Our future success and profitability will partly depend upon our ability to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demands for awarding contracts.\nCompetitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and products, particularly during industry downturns, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant increases in overall market capacity have also caused active price competition and led to lower pricing and utilization levels for our services and products. The competitive environment has intensified since the industry downturn that began in late 2014, which caused an oversupply of, and reduced demand for, oilfield services, and we have seen substantial reductions in the prices we can charge for our services. Any significant future increase in overall market capacity for completion, intervention and production services may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose significant customers, significant customers materially reduce their purchase orders or significant programs on which we rely are delayed, scaled back or eliminated, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur significant customers change from year to year, depending on the level of E&P activity and the use of our services. For the year ended January 31, 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. Our top five customers for the year ended January 31, 2020 together accounted for approximately 29% of our revenues. A reduction in purchases of our products and services by or the loss of one of our larger customers for any reason, such as the current industry conditions and economic downturn, insolvency of a customer, decreased production, changes in drilling practices, loss of a customer as a result of the acquisition of such customer by a purchaser who uses a competitor,\nin-sourcing by customers, a transfer of business to a competitor, failure to adequately service our clients or a strike, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to effectively and efficiently manage our equipment fleet as we expand our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantially expanded the size, scope and nature of our business, resulting in an increase in the breadth of our product offerings and an expansion of our business geographically. Business expansion places increasing demands on us to increase the inventories that we carry and/or our equipment fleet. We must anticipate demand well out into the future in order to service our extensive customer base. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage our assets to meet current and future needs of our customers, which may vary widely from what is originally forecast due to a number of factors beyond our control, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased leverage could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have $250.0 million principal amount outstanding of Notes due 2025, and we may incur additional debt under our ABL Facility or otherwise to finance our operations or for future expansion, including funding acquisitions. A high degree of leverage could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry; and\n\u00b7\nmake us vulnerable to increases in interest rates if we borrow under our ABL Facility, as any such borrowings would be made at variable interest rates.\nOur ability to borrow under the ABL Facility will depend upon availability thereunder. The amount of our availability is tied to the aggregate amount of our accounts receivable and inventory that satisfy specified criteria as well as our maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our current debt and any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that we cannot control. If we cannot service our debt or repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (1) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes or (2) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. The lenders or other investors who hold debt that we fail to service or on which we otherwise default could also accelerate amounts due, which could in such an instance potentially trigger a default or acceleration of other debt we may incur.\nThe indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility have significant financial and operating restrictions that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility contain financial, operating and/or negative covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments and investments, including dividend payments, to engage in transactions with affiliates, to engage in sale/leaseback transactions, to guarantee indebtedness and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. Agreements governing our future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any such agreement governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreement, which could permit acceleration of the related\ndebt, enforcement against any liens securing the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. We may not have, or may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any required accelerated payments.\nOur success may be affected by our ability to use and protect our proprietary technology as well as our ability to enter into license agreements.\nOur success may be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect, obtain and maintain intellectual property assets related to these developments. We rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect proprietary technology. We have received patents and have filed patent applications with respect to certain aspects of our technology, and we generally rely on patent protection with respect to our proprietary technology, as well as a combination of trade secrets, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights\npertaining to our products and technologies. We cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge our intellectual property rights in the future. If we are not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, such intellectual property rights may not provide significant value to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets and confidential know-how will not prevent third-parties from independently developing similar technologies or duplicating such technologies. Publicly available information (e.g., information in issued patents, published patent applications and scientific literature) can be used by third-parties to independently develop technology, and we cannot provide assurance that this independently developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, while we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology, even when regarded as patentable. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. Further, with respect to exclusive third-party arrangements, these arrangements could be terminated, which would result in our inability to provide the services and/or products covered by such arrangements.\nWe may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights and the value of our intellectual property rights is uncertain.\nWe may become involved in dispute resolution proceedings from time to time to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. In these dispute resolution proceedings, a defendant may assert that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Third-parties from time to time may also initiate dispute resolution proceedings against us by asserting that our business infringes, impairs, misappropriates, dilutes or otherwise violates another party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any such dispute resolution proceedings, and our intellectual property rights may be found invalid or unenforceable or our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. The results or costs of any such\ndispute resolution proceedings may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any dispute resolution proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly, is inherently unpredictable and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of its outcome.\nThe Motley, Red Bone and Tecton acquisitions and any future acquisitions may not be successful in delivering expected performance post-acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business was created largely through a series of acquisitions. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, frequently engage in acquisition discussions and conduct due diligence activities and, where appropriate, engage in acquisition negotiations, some of which could be material to us. Our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to effectively identify attractive businesses, access financing sources on acceptable terms,\nnegotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire, achieve cost efficiencies and manage these businesses as part of our company.\nOur acquisition activities, including our acquisitions of Motley, Red Bone and Tecton, may involve unanticipated delays, costs and other problems. If we encounter unanticipated problems with one of our acquisitions, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our business. We may lose key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, including those of Motley, Red Bone and Tecton, and we may be unable to commercially develop acquired technologies. We also risk entering markets in which we have limited prior experience. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions. Acquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities that we assume or incur in connection with acquisitions we complete. Additionally, depending upon the acquisition opportunities available, we also may need to raise additional funds through the capital markets or arrange for additional bank financing in order to consummate such acquisitions or to fund capital expenditures necessary to integrate such acquired businesses. We also may not be able to raise the substantial capital required for acquisitions and integrations on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, if we elect to utilize shares of common stock or other equity securities as consideration for one or more acquisitions or business combinations, or if we issue common stock or other equity securities in order to finance one or more acquisitions, existing stockholders of our company could experience dilution in the value of their securities, which could be material.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions.\nWe may experience future impairment charges.\nTo conduct our business operations and execute our strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur. The risk of impairment may be heightened for the duration of the current industry conditions, which may persist for a prolonged period. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements. As part of our strategy, we may make additional acquisitions, which may result in the addition of duplicative assets. In the event such an acquisition results in the combined assets of our Company and the acquired assets being in excess of any reasonable forecast of future need, the excess portion of the book value of these assets may be judged to be impaired. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess potential impairment to long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortized intangible assets) when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets is based on operational performance of our acquired businesses, expected changes in the global economy, oil and gas price and industry projections, discount rates and other judgmental factors. We would be required to record any such impairment losses resulting from any such test as a charge to operating results. To perform the annual assessment, we utilize a combination of income and market-based approaches to value the reporting units. The income approach to valuation relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-term strategic plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant, whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. Any future impairment loss could have a material non-cash adverse impact on our results of operations. As of January 31, 2020, our management believes the estimated fair value of our reporting unit\nwith a goodwill balance, our indefinite lived intangible assets and each of our long-lived assets were each in excess of their carrying values. There were no indicators of goodwill or intangible asset impairment at January 31, 2020.\nThe abrupt deterioration in industry conditions, which began in the third quarter and accelerated through the end of our fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, was driven by a sharp decline in U.S. land rig count and an unprecedented decline in operating frac spreads from the second quarter through the end of 2019. The decline in E&P activity resulted in lower demand levels and lower current and expected revenues for our business, which led us to accelerate our annual testing for asset impairment into the third quarter. As a result, we reported a non-cash asset impairment charge of $47.0 million in Fiscal 2019. Based on the impairment indicators above, we performed a long-lived asset impairment analysis and concluded that the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived assets exceeded the carrying amount of each segment\u2019s asset group as of October 31, 2019 and December 31, 2019.\nOur total assets include intangible assets. The write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported financial results.\nOur total assets include intangible assets. Our intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In this event, the amount is written down to fair value. Under GAAP, this would result in a non-cash charge to operating earnings. The risk of write-downs may be heightened for the duration of the current industry conditions, which may persist for a prolonged period. Any determination requiring the non-cash write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized identified intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, which could be material. For example, during the year ended January 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $47.0 million. There were no impairment charges recorded in Fiscal 2018 or 2017. As of January 31, 2020, the balances of goodwill and intangible assets were $28.3 million and $45.8 million, respectively.\nOur operations rely on an extensive network of information technology resources and a failure to maintain, upgrade and protect such systems could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to cyber security risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology plays a crucial role in all of our operations. To remain competitive, our hardware, software and related services must interact with our suppliers and customers efficiently, record and process our financial transactions accurately, and obtain the data and information to enable the analysis of trends and plans and the execution of our strategies. Our information technology systems are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could cause us harm. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or customer data; interruption of business operations; or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been expanding our available products and services in recent periods. Our inability to properly manage or support future expansion of our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe have been expanding our available products and services in recent periods and ay to continue to expand over time through the internal expansion of products and services and potential acquisitions. Any such expansion, if achieved, could place significant demands on our management team and our operational, administrative and financial resources. We may not be able to expand effectively or manage our expansion successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nOur assets require capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment, and we may require capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur equipment requires periodic capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain its competitiveness. Our equipment typically does not generate revenue while it is undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Moreover, if the current period of low demand for our services and challenging business conditions in the energy sector generally persists for a prolonged period, we may be unable to make capital investments. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update our products and services. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand and the increase in cost to maintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition among oilfield service and equipment providers is affected by each provider\u2019s reputation for safety and quality.\nOur activities are subject to a wide range of national, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, customers maintain their own compliance and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with these health and safety laws and regulations, or failure to comply with our customers\u2019 compliance or reporting requirements, could tarnish our reputation for safety and quality and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position.\nSeasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for services and operations.\nWeather can have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal, and any variation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. Adverse weather conditions, including rain, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and severe cold weather, may interrupt or curtail operations, our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Specifically, we typically have experienced a pause by our customers around the holiday season in the fourth quarter, which may be compounded as our customers exhaust their annual capital spending budgets towards year end. Additionally, our operations are directly affected by weather conditions. During the winter months (first and fourth quarters) and periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, particularly in the northeastern U.S., Colorado, North Dakota and Wyoming, our customers may delay operations or we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations. Also, during the spring thaw, which normally starts in late March and continues through June, some areas impose transportation restrictions to prevent damage caused by the spring thaw. In addition, throughout the year heavy rains adversely affect activity levels, as well locations and dirt access roads can become impassible in wet conditions.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage or other litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. As the wells we service continue to become more complex, our exposure to such inherent risks becomes greater as downhole risks increase exponentially with an increase in complexity and lateral length. Litigation arising from operations where our facilities are located, or our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. For example, transportation of heavy equipment creates the potential for our trucks to become involved in roadway accidents, which in turn could result in personal injury or property damages lawsuits being filed against us.\nUncertainty related to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our future debt obligations.\nAny borrowings under our ABL Facility will bear interest based on a base rate or a LIBOR based rate. LIBOR is calculated by reference to a market for interbank lending, and it is based on increasingly fewer actual transactions. This reduction increases the subjectivity of the LIBOR calculation process and increases the risk of manipulation. Actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies, as well as the ICE Benchmark Administration (the current LIBOR administrator), may result in changes to how LIBOR is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. For example, in 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. U.S. dollar LIBOR is likely to be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but the timing of this change is unknown. SOFR is an overnight rate rather than a term rate, making it an inexact replacement for LIBOR, and there is not currently an established process for creating robust, forward-looking, SOFR term rates.\nChanging the benchmark rate for LIBOR loans from LIBOR to SOFR will require calculations of a spread. Industry organizations are attempting to structure the spread calculation in a manner that minimizes the possibility of value transfer between borrowers, lenders and contractual counterparties as a result of the switch to SOFR, but there can be no assurance that the calculated spread will be fair and accurate. We cannot predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our ABL Facility to determine a replacement interest rate for LIBOR with the new standard that is established. If we were unable to agree to an amendment to our ABL Facility to replace LIBOR, any borrowings under our ABL Facility would bear interest at the base rate, which has historically been higher than the LIBOR based rate. The potential effect of any such event or our future borrowing costs for any borrowings under our ABL Facility cannot yet be determined.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off, and the spin-off may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our separation from KLX and operating as an independent, publicly-traded company will enhance our long-term value. However, by separating from KLX, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of KLX. Our performance may not meet our expectations for a variety of reasons. There also can be no assurance that the spin-off will not adversely affect our business.\nWe have a limited operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information for periods prior to the spin-off that we have included in this Form 10-K has been derived from KLX\u2019s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. KLX did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. In addition, the historical information may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future. For example, following the spin-off, changes have occurred in our cost structure, debt financing and interest expense, funding and operations, including changes in our tax structure and increased costs associated with operating as a public, stand-alone company.\nThe spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe spin-off continues to be subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or KLX or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the spin-off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding our claims against KLX, requiring our stockholders to return to KLX some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the spin-off, or providing KLX with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by KLX and the fair market value of our company at the time of the spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if: (1) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, KLX or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off.\nThe distribution of our common stock in the spin-off is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the DGCL, a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although KLX made the distribution of our common stock entirely from surplus, we cannot assure you that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distribution to KLX stockholders was unlawful.\nEach of KLX and KLX Energy Services determined that it was solvent at the time of the spin-off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of KLX Energy Services common stock), will be able to repay its debts as they mature following the spin-off and have sufficient capital to carry on its businesses and the spin-off, and the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL. The expectations of the board of directors of KLX in this regard were based on a number of assumptions, including its expectations as to the post-spin-off operating performance and cash flow of each of KLX and KLX Energy Services and its analysis of the post-spin-off assets and liabilities of each company. We cannot assure you, however, that a court would reach the same conclusions as the board of directors of KLX in determining whether KLX or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the spin-off or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to KLX\u2019s stockholders.\nA court could require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to KLX under the Distribution Agreement.\nUnder the Distribution Agreement, from and after the spin-off, each of KLX (now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company) and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates following the consummation of the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that are not allocated to us under the Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to KLX (including, for example, environmental liabilities), particularly if KLX were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell shares of common stock in the future. We may also issue additional shares of common stock, including as employee compensation or as consideration in one or more acquisitions or other business combination transactions. As of January 31, 2020, we had outstanding approximately 25.0 million shares of our common stock. We also have registered 3,225,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our LTIP, 200,000 registered shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 300,000 registered shares are reserved for issuance under our Non-Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan. Of those shares initially registered and reserved for issuance, as of January 31, 2020, approximately 3,085,000 restricted shares of common stock were granted in connection with equity awards to management, directors and employees and approximately 230,000 shares remain available for future issuance. The restricted shares outstanding include approximately 1,985,000 shares of restricted stock that were granted to certain members of our management under our LTIP on September 14, 2018, the spin-off distribution date, aggregating approximately 8% of our shares outstanding on January 31, 2020. The shares of restricted stock granted on the distribution date will vest ratably over four years from the distribution date, with one quarter of the shares vesting on each anniversary of the distribution date, subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances. In addition, the final installment of consideration for the Motley acquisition ($3.0 million) payable to certain employees of Motley in shares of our common stock will be made in November 2020, the second anniversary of the closing of the Motley transaction. The number of shares to be issued will be determined based on the volume weighted average trading price of our shares for the 10 trading days ending two trading days prior to the issuance of the shares. We may, at our option, elect to pay the installment in cash in lieu of issuing the shares.\nSubject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions and the requirements of Rule 144, the registered restricted shares of our common stock will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. With respect to shares of restricted stock granted to certain members of our management, we have filed a resale prospectus in order to allow such members of our management to freely resell their restricted stock once it has vested. In addition, certain members of our management are entitled to registration rights with respect to their shares of restricted stock.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Sales of or other transactions relating to shares of our common stock by our directors, officers or employees could cause a perception in the market place that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company or that it is otherwise an advantageous time to sell shares of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends. Our dividend policy will be established by our Board based on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board considers relevant. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our debt limit, and the terms of the agreements governing any future debt may limit or prohibit, the payments of dividends. We cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we do commence the payment of dividends.\nAdditionally, our indebtedness could have important consequences for holders of our common stock. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our Board\u2019s ability to declare dividends on our common stock will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing any proposed dividends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effect any such actions or do so on\nsatisfactory terms, if at all, or that such actions would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.\nCertain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and certain provisions of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company or other strategic transactions, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the DGCL, this provision could also delay or effectively prevent a change of control that some stockholders may favor. In general, Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that, together with their affiliates and associates, acquire ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that corporation or its subsidiaries, including any merger or various other transactions, for a three-year period following the date on which that person became the owner of 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or effectively prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a different judicial forum for intra-corporate disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing to selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of KLX Energy Services, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of KLX Energy Services to KLX Energy Services or KLX Energy Services\u2019 stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), KLX Energy Services\u2019 certificate of incorporation or the bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a different judicial forum, including one that it may find favorable or convenient for intra-corporate disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nUtilizing the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are therefore eligible to utilize certain reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. Pursuant to these reduced disclosure requirements, emerging growth companies are not required to, among other things, hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, emerging growth companies have longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue,\nhave more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nWe intend to utilize certain of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and its trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 18048, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "KLXE"}
