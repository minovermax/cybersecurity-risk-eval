{"cik": "852772", "company": "DENNYS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from projections in forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases and in public statements made orally by our representatives.\nA decline in general economic conditions could adversely affect our financial results.\nConsumer spending habits, including discretionary spending on dining at restaurants such as ours, are affected by many factors including:\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\nenergy costs, especially gasoline prices;\n\u2022\nlevels of employment;\n\u2022\nsalaries and wage rates;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence; and\n\u2022\nconsumer perception of economic conditions.\nWeakness or uncertainty regarding the United States economy, as a result of reactions to consumer credit availability, increasing energy prices, inflation, increasing interest rates, unemployment, war, terrorist activity or other unforeseen events could adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower restaurant sales.\nOur financial condition depends on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to operate restaurants profitably, to generate positive cash flows and to generate acceptable returns on invested capital. The returns and profitability of our restaurants may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including those described below.\nFood service businesses are often adversely affected by changes in:\n\u2022\nconsumer tastes, including nutritional concerns;\n\u2022\nconsumer spending habits;\n\u2022\nglobal, national, regional and local economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ndemographic trends.\nThe performance of our individual restaurants may be adversely affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ntraffic patterns;\n\u2022\ndemographic considerations; and\n\u2022\nthe type, number and location of competing restaurants.\nDependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects food service businesses to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. In addition, the food service industry in general, and our results of operations and financial condition in particular, may be adversely affected by unfavorable trends or developments such as:\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nincreased food costs;\n\u2022\nincreased energy costs;\n\u2022\nlabor and employee benefits costs (including increases in minimum hourly wage, employment tax rates, health care costs and workers\u2019 compensation costs);\n\u2022\nregional weather conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of experienced management and hourly employees.\nOperating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets and potentially close certain restaurants.\nThe financial performance of our franchisees can negatively impact our business.\nAs we are heavily franchised, our financial results are contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. We receive royalties, contributions to advertising and, in some cases, lease payments from our franchisees. We have established operational standards, guidelines and strategic plans for our franchisees; however, we have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. While we are responsible for ensuring the success of our entire chain of restaurants and for taking a longer term view with respect to system improvements, our franchisees have individual business strategies and objectives, which might conflict with our interests. Our franchisees may have business interests outside of their Denny\u2019s restaurants, making them subject to business and financial risks unrelated to the operation of our restaurants. These unrelated risks could adversely affect a franchisee's ability to make payments to us or their ability to secure adequate financing to open or continue operating their Denny\u2019s restaurants. If they incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, it could result in financial distress or even bankruptcy. Our franchisees are impacted by the implementation of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act. If a significant number of franchisees become financially distressed, it could harm our operating results through reduced royalties and lease income.\nFor 2014, our ten largest franchisees accounted for 32% of our franchise revenue. The balance of our franchise revenue is derived from the remaining 258 franchisees. Although the loss of revenues from the closure of any one franchised restaurant may not be material, such revenues generate margins that may exceed those generated by other restaurants or offset fixed costs which we continue to incur.\nWe have guarantees related to certain franchisee leases and loans. Payments under these guarantees would result from the inability of a franchisee to fund required payments when due. Through December 31, 2014, no events had occurred that caused us to make payments under the guarantees. There were $9.8 million and $6.1 million of loans outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2014 and December 25, 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the maximum amounts payable under the lease guarantee and loan guarantees were $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability and that of our franchisees to open new restaurants. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could adversely affect our planned growth.\nThe development of new restaurants may be adversely affected by risks such as:\n\u2022\ncosts and availability of capital for the company and/or franchisees;\n\u2022\ncompetition for restaurant sites;\n\u2022\ninability to identify suitable franchisees;\n\u2022\nnegotiation of favorable purchase or lease terms for restaurant sites;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain all required governmental approvals and permits;\n\u2022\ndelays in completion of construction;\n\u2022\nchallenge of identifying, recruiting and training qualified restaurant managers;\n\u2022\ndeveloped restaurants not achieving the expected revenue or cash flow;\n\u2022\nchallenges specific to the growth of international operations and nontraditional restaurants that are different from traditional domestic development; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThe locations where we have restaurants may cease to be attractive as demographic patterns change.\nThe success of our owned and franchised restaurants is significantly influenced by location. Current locations may not continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. It is possible that the neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, potentially resulting in reduced sales at those locations.\nOur expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand, our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors.\nThe international markets in which our franchisees currently operate and any additional markets our franchisees may enter outside of the United States, have many differences as compared to our domestic markets. There may be lower consumer familiarity with the Denny\u2019s brand in these markets, as well as different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and economic conditions. As a result, our franchised international restaurants may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels, and may never do so, thereby affecting the brand\u2019s overall growth and profitability. Building brand awareness may take longer than expected, which could negatively impact our profitability in those markets.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations in our international markets impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe restaurant business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be adversely affected.\nEach of our restaurants competes with a wide variety of restaurants ranging from national and regional restaurant chains to locally owned restaurants. We expect competition to continue to increase. The following are important aspects of competition:\n\u2022\nrestaurant location;\n\u2022\nadvantageous commercial real estate suitable for restaurants;\n\u2022\nnumber and location of competing restaurants;\n\u2022\nattractiveness and repair and maintenance of facilities;\n\u2022\nfood quality, new product development and value;\n\u2022\ndietary trends, including nutritional content;\n\u2022\ntraining, courtesy and hospitality standards;\n\u2022\nability to attract and retain high quality staff;\n\u2022\nquality and speed of service; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of marketing and advertising programs.\nOur reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of the failure to protect the integrity and security of guest information or employees' personal data.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and employees. Our use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third-party contracts. If our security and information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber attack or any other failures or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to this data, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance.\nNumerous government regulations impact our business, and our failure to comply with them could adversely affect our business.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things:\n\u2022\npreparation, labeling, advertising and sale of food;\n\u2022\nsanitation and safety;\n\u2022\nland use, sign restrictions and environmental matters;\n\u2022\nemployee health care requirements, including the implementation and uncertain legal, regulatory and cost implications of the health care reform law;\n\u2022\npayment card regulation and related industry rules;\n\u2022\nthe sale of alcoholic beverages;\n\u2022\nhiring and employment practices, including minimum wage and tip credit laws and fair labor standards; and\n\u2022\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\nThe operation of our franchisee system is also subject to regulations enacted by a number of states and rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. If we or our franchisees fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we or our franchisees could be subjected to restaurant closure, fines, penalties and litigation, which may be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the future enactment of additional legislation regulating the franchise relationship could adversely affect our operations.\nWe began complying with The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act in 2014. Because of the breadth and complexity of this legislation and the phased-in nature of implementation, we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the laws will have on us. However, we expect that our expenses related to employee health benefits will increase over the long term as a result of this legislation. Any such increases could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the health care legislation will require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus effective December 1, 2015. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision of the law, but cannot anticipate the changes in guest behavior that could result from the implementation of this provision, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and international laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises, and may contain provisions that supersede the terms of franchise agreements, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complaints or litigation brought by former, current or prospective employees, customers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders or others. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. However, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. A judgment that is not covered by insurance or that is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In\naddition, regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operations and hurt our performance. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may harm our business or that of our franchisees.\nNegative publicity generated by incidents at a few restaurants can adversely affect the operating results of our entire chain and the Denny\u2019s brand.\nFood safety concerns, criminal activity, alleged discrimination or other operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants do not just impact that particular restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Rather, our entire chain of restaurants may be at risk from the negative publicity generated by an incident at a single restaurant. The increasing use of social media platforms has increased the speed and scope of adverse publicity and could hinder our ability to quickly and effectively respond to such reports. This negative publicity can adversely affect the operating results of our entire chain and the Denny\u2019s brand.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to attract, motivate and retain these and other key officers and key team members, particularly regional and area managers and restaurant general managers. Competition for these employees is intense.\nIf our internal controls are ineffective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nWe maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and tested by the company\u2019s full time Internal Audit Department. The Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe we have a well-designed system to maintain adequate internal controls on the business; however, we cannot be certain that our controls will be adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing errors or fraud. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations.\nAs a holding company, Denny\u2019s Corporation depends on upstream payments from its operating subsidiaries.\nAlmost all our assets are owned, and all of our operating revenues are earned, by our subsidiaries, which are also the primary obligors for substantially all of the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities related to our business. Accordingly, our ability to repurchase shares of our Common Stock and to make any distributions to our shareholders depends on the performance of those subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to Denny\u2019s Corporation. Their ability to make such distributions may be subject to contractual and other restrictions.\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading price of our stock.\nFactors such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report directly relates to our business, could have an impact on the trading price of our stock. In addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders, as well as non-operating initiatives such as our share repurchase program. Any failure to meet market expectations whether for same-store sales, restaurant unit growth, earnings per share or other metrics could cause our share price to decline.\nOur indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $158.8 million, including capital leases.\nWe continually monitor our cash flow and liquidity needs. Although we believe that our existing cash balances, funds from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to cover those needs, we could seek additional sources of funds, including incurring additional debt and selling selected assets, to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our ongoing operating needs, pay interest and scheduled debt amortization and fund anticipated capital expenditures over the next twelve months. We have no material debt maturities scheduled until April 2018. If we are unable to satisfy or refinance our current debt as it comes due, we may default on our debt obligations.\nFor additional information concerning our indebtedness see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur debt instruments include restrictive covenants. These covenants may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter a variety of transactions. A breach of these covenants could cause acceleration of a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe credit agreement governing our indebtedness contains various covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends, repurchase shares of our Common Stock or make distributions or certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate dividend or other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets and use the proceeds thereof;\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain mergers and consolidations.\nThese covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. If we incur additional debt in the future, covenant limitations on our activities (and risks associated with such increased debt levels generally) could increase.\nThough we currently participate in a share repurchase program, such program is subject to restrictions under our credit agreement and there can be no assurance that we will repurchase our Common Stock pursuant to the program. Our credit agreement contains additional restrictive covenants, including financial maintenance requirements. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as uncertainties related to the current economy, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply with these covenants.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt instruments, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them, if any, to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under our current or future indebtedness accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot be sure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 85726, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "DENN"}
