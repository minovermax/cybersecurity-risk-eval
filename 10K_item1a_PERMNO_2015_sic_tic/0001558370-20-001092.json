{"cik": "701374", "company": "Six Flags Entertainment Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the principal risks that we believe are most significant to our business and should be considered by our security holders. We operate in a continually changing business environment and, therefore, new risks emerge from time to time. This section contains forward-looking statements. For an explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements, see \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nGeneral economic conditions throughout the world may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends to a large extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Difficult economic conditions and recessionary periods may have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition. Negative economic conditions, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have at times had a negative effect on consumers\u2019 discretionary income and consumer confidence, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decrease in discretionary spending due to decreases in consumer confidence in the economy or us, or a continued economic slowdown or deterioration in the economy, could adversely affect the frequency with which guests choose to visit our parks and the amount that our guests spend when they visit. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. Both attendance and guest spending at our parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, difficult economic conditions throughout the world could impact our ability to obtain supplies, services and credit as well as the ability of third parties to meet their obligations to us, including, for example, payment of claims by our insurance carriers, the funding of our lines of credit, or payment by our international agreement partners. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies could reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor and supply costs in non-U.S. markets or reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we earn in other markets.\nOur growth strategy and strategic plan may not achieve the anticipated results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing parks, rides, attractions and other entertainment offerings, as well as through our culinary and retail offerings. Our business strategy for growth may also include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as international agreements, joint ventures and partnerships that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brand. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not increase our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. Our business strategy for growth also requires that the other parties to our international agreements, joint ventures and partnerships perform their obligations. In addition, the success of any acquisitions depends on the effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, we had previously established, but did not achieve, our long-term aspirational goal to achieve Modified EBITDA of $600 million by 2017 and we believe that on-time or late achievement of our 2020 Performance Award (Project 750) is not reasonably attainable.\nOur strategy to grow our business by attracting guests through innovation and enhancement to the guest experience may not be successful. If we are unable to achieve our strategic objectives and grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nBad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions can adversely impact attendance at our parks.\nBecause most of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues. The effects of bad weather on attendance can be more pronounced at our waterparks. We believe our operating results in certain years were adversely affected by abnormally hot, cold and/or wet weather in a number of our major U.S. markets. In addition, since a number of our parks are geographically concentrated in the eastern portion of the United States, a weather pattern that affects that area could adversely affect a number of our parks and disproportionately impact our results of operations. In addition, our parks in California and Texas are more likely to be impacted by extreme heat, wildfires, mudslides and floods than our parks in other locations. Bad weather and forecasts of bad weather on weekends, holidays or other peak periods will typically have a greater negative impact on our revenues and could disproportionately impact our results of operations.\nNatural disasters, public heath crises, terrorist activities or other events outside our control could damage our properties and could adversely impact attendance at our parks and result in decreased revenues.\nAn earthquake, hurricane, forest fire, flood, landslide or other natural disaster, or a power shortage or outage or other comparable events could disrupt our operations, impair critical systems, damage our properties or reduce the number of guests who visit our parks in affected areas. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, such a disaster may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. For example, our waterpark in Oaxtepec, Mexico was closed for several months during the fall of 2017 following the earthquakes in central Mexico. The occurrence of such natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLower attendance at our parks may be caused by events outside our control such as terrorist alerts and threats of future terrorist activities, contagious disease outbreaks, or local activities that we may not be able to adequately anticipate or respond to. For example, in December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China, and additional cases have been identified in other locations including the United States. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain at this time. In addition, since some of our parks are near major urban areas and appeal to teenagers and young adults, there may be disturbances at one or more parks that could negatively affect our image. This may result in a decrease in attendance at the affected parks and could adversely impact our results of operations. We cannot predict the frequency or severity of these activities and the effect that they may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are seasonal.\nOur operations are seasonal. Approximately 75% of our annual park attendance and revenue occurs during the second and third calendar quarters of each year. As a result, when conditions or events described in the above risk factors occur during the operating season, particularly during the peak months of July and August, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. In addition, most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions are incurred when the parks are closed in the mid-to-late autumn and winter months. For this reason, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or of how we will perform in the future.\nFailures in, material damage to, or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites and difficulties in updating our systems or software or implementing new systems or software could adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. We own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for the operation of our business. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malicious attacks, security breaches and natural and man-made disasters. We require continued and unimpeded access to these systems. Damage or interruption to our information technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions. In particular, our ticket, season pass and membership sales system relies on data communications networks and technology systems and software operated by unaffiliated third parties. The success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. If we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected.\nCyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we and our third-party service providers experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. The techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents.\nEven if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems has continued to increase in recent years. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of guest, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us. Such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests and employees and our internal data are unsuccessful, we may face costly litigation and our revenue and reputation could suffer.\nAn important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests as well as maintaining our internal business data. We are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of our guests\u2019 personal information. We have, and require certain of our vendors to have, programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors, and vendors. Like many other companies, from time to time, both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents; however, to date, these incidents have not been material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to litigation, fines or other costs, our operations could be disrupted, and our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to stop purchasing tickets, memberships or season passes from us or visiting our parks altogether.\nFailure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position.\nThe theme park and waterpark industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for operation of our parks, ticket, membership and season pass sales and management, and labor and inventory management. These technologies may require refinements and upgrades. The development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us. As various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a cost-effective and timely manner. We may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system.\nThere is a risk of accidents occurring at our parks or competing parks which may reduce attendance and negatively impact our operations.\nOur brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our parks, services and rides, and our corporate and management integrity. While we carefully maintain the safety of our rides, there are inherent risks involved with these attractions. An accident or an injury (including water-borne illnesses at waterparks) at any of our parks or at parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our parks, and negatively impact our results of operations. For example, in September 2019, a coaster accident at La Feria, a competing park in Mexico, resulted in two fatalities. We believe that the publicity surrounding this accident had a significant negative impact on attendance at our park in Mexico during that period. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year.\nWe depend on a seasonal workforce, many of whom are paid at minimum wage.\nOur park operations are dependent in part on a seasonal workforce, many of whom are paid at minimum wage. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons, however, we may be unable to recruit and hire sufficient personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, we cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce will not occur in the future. Increased state or federal minimum wage requirements, seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We anticipate that the recent increases to the minimum wage rates will increase our salary, wage and benefit expenses in 2020 and future years and further legislative changes could continue to increase these expenses in the future.\nThe theme park and waterpark industry competes with numerous entertainment alternatives and such competition may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur parks compete with other theme parks, waterparks and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sporting events, restaurants and vacation travel. Our business is also subject to factors that affect the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions, including relative fuel prices, and changes in consumer spending habits. The principal competitive factors of a park include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park and the quality of its food and entertainment. If we are unable to compete effectively against entertainment alternatives or on the basis of principal competitive factors of the park, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products.\nThe success of our parks depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that can change in often unpredictable ways and on our ability to ensure that our parks meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. We conduct research and analysis before acquiring new parks or opening new rides or attractions and often invest substantial amounts before we learn the extent to which these new parks and new rides or attractions will earn consumer acceptance. If visitor volumes at our parks were to decline significantly or if new rides and entertainment offerings at our parks do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, revenues and margins may decline. Our results of operations may also be adversely affected if we fail to retain long-term customer loyalty or provide satisfactory customer service.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.\nAlthough we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured. The majority of our current insurance policies have annual terms and expire on December 31, 2020, and we cannot guarantee we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme or waterpark operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. If our insurance coverage is not adequate, or we become subject to damages that cannot by law be insured against, such as punitive damages or certain intentional misconduct by our employees, this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are not able to fund capital expenditures and invest in future attractions and projects in our parks, our revenues could be negatively impacted.\nBecause a principal competitive factor for a theme park or a waterpark is the uniqueness and perceived quality of its rides and attractions, we need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. A key element for our revenue growth is strategic capital spending on such investments. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot provide assurance our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. In addition, any construction delays or ride downtime can adversely affect our attendance and our ability to realize revenue growth.\nIncidents involving food contamination, product recalls, product liability claims and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition.\nThe sale of food, toys and other retail products involves legal and other risks. While we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable customers to enjoy safe, quality food products, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) could occur in our parks. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues could negatively affect our sales and reputation and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or other damages. We may need to recall food products if they become contaminated, and we may need to recall toys, games or other retail merchandise if there is a design or product defect. Even though we are resellers of food, toys and other retail products, we may be liable if the consumption or purchase of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. A recall could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A significant food or retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of consumer confidence in our parks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to manufacture theme park or waterpark rides and attractions.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers\u2019 financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our parks, our employees or regulators. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings is determined adversely to us, or if we receive a judgment, a fine or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money, or injunctive relief is issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Litigation can also be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, including to our management due to the increased time and resources required to respond to and address the litigation.\nAdditionally, from time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make negative public statements about us or bring claims before government agencies or lawsuits against us. Such claims and lawsuits sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our featured animals. On other occasions, such claims and/or lawsuits are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves in any lawsuits, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us. An unfavorable outcome in any legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, associated negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our international agreements.\nVarious external factors, including difficult economic and political conditions throughout the world, could negatively affect the progress of our initiatives to develop new Six Flags-branded parks outside of North America. These initiatives could be delayed, and the ultimate success of such parks may be uncertain. For example, we cancelled our project in Dubai and, on February 14, 2020, we terminated our agreements with our partner in China parks as a result of its uncured payment defaults.\nSome factors that will be important to the success of our international agreement initiatives are different than those affecting our existing parks. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in new international markets into which we expand our brand may not embrace the parks\u2019 offerings to the same extent as consumers in our existing markets. International agreements are also subject to additional risks, including the performance of our partners and their ability to obtain financing and government approvals; the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the U.S.; difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences; changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions; the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls, and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. If we do not realize the benefits of such transactions, it could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur leases contain default provisions that, if enforced or exercised by the landlord, could significantly impact our operations at those parks.\nOf our 26 theme parks and waterparks, 12 are located on property that we lease and do not own. Certain of our leases permit the landlord to terminate the lease if there is a default under the lease, including, for example, our failure to pay rent, utilities and applicable taxes in a timely fashion or to maintain certain insurance. If a landlord were to terminate a lease, it would halt our operations at that park and, depending on the size of the park, could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any disputes that may result from such a termination may be expensive to pursue and may divert money and management\u2019s attention from our other operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability or material increase in the cost to protect them could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property, including our trademarks and domain names and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breach of any contractual obligations to us, or independent development of intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. In addition, pursuant to our license agreements, we have exclusive theme park usage rights in the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada and Mexico to certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters. The license fee is subject to periodic scheduled adjustments and CPI increases, and Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances, such as a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. The termination of these licenses, or a material increase in the cost to retain these licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may increase our operating expenses.\nIncreased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our results of operations.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions which will impact our future healthcare costs. We do not anticipate these changes will result in a material increase in our operating costs. Our results of operations are also substantially affected by costs of retirement, including as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, such as declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities.\nAdditionally, we contribute to multiple defined benefit multiemployer pension plans on behalf of our collectively bargained employees of Six Flags Great Adventure LLC. If we were to cease contributing to or otherwise incur a withdrawal from any such plans, we could be obligated to pay withdrawal liability assessments based on the underfunded status (if any) of such plans at the time of the withdrawal. The amount of any multiemployer pension plan underfunding can fluctuate from year to year, and thus there is a possibility that the amount of withdrawal liability that we could incur in the future could be material, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nUnionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 16% of our full-time and approximately 11% of our seasonal employees were subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. We have collective bargaining agreements in place for certain employees at Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Six Flags Great Adventure, Six Flags Over Texas, Six Flags St. Louis, and La Ronde. New unionization activity or a labor dispute involving our employees could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of unionization activities or labor disputes could increase our costs. Litigation relating to employment and/or wage and hour disputes could also increase our operating expenses. Such disrupted operations, reduced revenues or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.\nWe are subject to laws that regulate the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of our guests\u2019 personally identifiable information. These laws apply not only to third-party transactions but also to transfers of information between or among the Company and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. These laws continue to evolve in ways we cannot predict, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions, and that may harm our business.\nFor example, California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), effective as of January 1, 2020, which provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. In addition to the CCPA, several other states are considering adopting laws and regulations that will impose obligations with respect to how companies handle personal data. Compliance with the CCPA, and other current and future applicable privacy and related laws can be costly and time-consuming and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant damages and penalties.\nOur privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data are available on our website. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, including the CCPA, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites, mobile platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed.\nOur operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental, health and safety and other regulations, which create uncertainty regarding future expenditures and liabilities.\nOur operations involve wastewater and stormwater discharges and air emissions, and as a result are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements. These requirements are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states and localities where our parks are located (and can also often be enforced through citizen suit provisions) and include the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. Our operations also involve maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks, and managing and disposing of hazardous substances, chemicals and materials and are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these substances, chemicals and materials, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"). A portion of our capital expenditures budget is intended to ensure continued compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements. In the event of contamination or injury as a result of a release of or exposure to regulated materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages. For example, pursuant to CERCLA, past and current owners and operators of facilities and persons arranging for disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for costs to remediate releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing regarding our property. Our activities may be affected by new legislation or changes in existing environmental, health and safety laws. For example, the state or federal government having jurisdiction over a given area may enact legislation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or applicable state entity may propose new regulations or change existing regulations that could require our parks to reduce certain emissions or discharges. Such action could require our parks to install costly equipment or increase operating expenses. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements.\nWe also are subject to federal and state laws, which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key management and other key employees.\nOur employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, adversely affecting our business.\nRisk related to tariffs and other duties\nWe source merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities located outside of North America. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or may utilize components or materials manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. Our business exposes us to risks associated with global commerce, including changes to tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports. While existing tariffs and duties have not had a material impact on our business, the U.S. government may impose additional tariffs on thousands of products sourced from foreign countries and has expressed a willingness to impose additional or increased tariffs on goods imported from China, including many items that we purchase for our business. While the impact has been immaterial to date, tariffs or duties could lower our gross margin on impacted products. Additionally, even if the products that we import are not affected directly by tariffs or other duties, the imposition of such additional tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased pricing of other consumer goods, which could lower the discretionary income of our potential guests and decrease attendance or in-park spending.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Common Stock\nA portion of our cash flow is required to be used to fund our substantial monetary obligations.\nWe must satisfy the following obligations with respect to the Partnership Parks:\n\u25cf We must make annual distributions to our partners in the Partnership Parks, which will amount to approximately $74.2 million in 2020 (based on our ownership of units as of December 31, 2019, our share of the distribution will be approximately $32.5 million), with similar amounts (adjusted for changes in cost of living) payable in future years.\n\u25cf We must spend a minimum of approximately 6% of each of the Partnership Parks\u2019 annual revenues over specified periods for capital expenditures.\n\u25cf Each year we must offer to purchase all outstanding limited partnership units from our partners in the Partnership Parks. The remaining redeemable units of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately $529.3 million as of December 31, 2019. As we purchase additional units, we are entitled to a proportionate increase in our share of the minimum annual distributions. In future years, we may need to incur indebtedness under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility to satisfy such unit purchase obligations.\nWe expect to use cash flow from the operations at the Partnership Parks to satisfy all or part of our annual distribution and capital expenditure obligations with respect to these parks before we use any of our other funds. The two partnerships generated approximately $79.3 million of cash in 2019 from operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or repayments to us. As of December 31, 2019, we had loans outstanding of $239.3 million to the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks, primarily to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta, and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners in prior years. The obligations relating to SFOG continue until 2027 and those relating to SFOT continue until 2028. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner, and we would lose control of the Partnership Parks. In addition, such a default could trigger an event of default under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility. For more information regarding the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement, see \"Business-Partnership Park Arrangements.\"\nWe spent $140.2 million on capital expenditures, net of property insurance recoveries, during the 2019 calendar year. We plan to strategically reinvest in our properties to improve the guest experience. Our business plan includes targeted annual capital spending, however, depending on various factors including strategic initiatives, unanticipated delays, weather conditions, and availability and cost of ride components, we may spend more or less than our planned target amount.\nOur indebtedness under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility and our other obligations could have material negative consequences to us and investors in our securities. The following could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations:\n\u25cf We may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the instruments governing our outstanding debt, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt we may have incurred.\n\u25cf We could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes.\n\u25cf We could have difficulties obtaining additional financing to fund our annual Partnership Park obligations if the amount of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility is insufficient.\n\u25cf We would have to use a significant portion of our cash flow to make payments on our debt and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion.\n\u25cf Adverse economic or industry conditions may have a more negative impact on us.\nWe cannot be sure that cash generated from our parks will be as high as we expect or that our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flows are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by attendance levels, in-park sales, accommodations and sponsorship and international agreement activity. A lower amount of cash generated from our parks or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nVarious factors could affect Holdings\u2019 ability to sustain its dividend.\nHoldings\u2019 ability to pay a dividend on its common stock or sustain it at current levels is subject to our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends. In addition, our debt agreements contain certain limitations on the amount of cash we are permitted to distribute to our stockholders by way of dividend or stock repurchase. In addition, Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors may suspend the payment of dividends, or increase or decrease the dividend amount, at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment in the Company. This appreciation may not occur or our stock may depreciate in value.\nWe may be unable to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our debt, including the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on and the 2027 Notes, depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. We cannot provide assurance our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansion and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we are required to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt to meet our debt service and other obligations, we cannot provide assurance the terms of any such transaction will be satisfactory to us or if, or how soon, any such transaction could be completed.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B has interest payments calculated on a London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus an additional percentage based on credit risk. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading and compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of an alternative reference rate. The consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on our current interest payments. Changes in market interest rates may influence our future financing costs and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe market price of Holdings\u2019 common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in Holdings\u2019 common stock to decline.\nWe can give no assurances about future liquidity in the trading market for Holdings\u2019 common stock. If there is limited liquidity in the trading market for Holdings\u2019 common stock, a sale of a large number of shares of Holdings\u2019 common stock could be adversely disruptive to the market price of Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nNumerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of Holdings\u2019 common stock. These risks include those described or referred to in this \"Risk Factors\" section and in other documents incorporated herein by reference as well as, among other things:\n\u25cf Our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf Our ability to repay our debt;\n\u25cf Our access to financial and capital markets to refinance our debt or replace the existing credit facilities;\n\u25cf Investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf Our dividend policy;\n\u25cf Our stock repurchase program;\n\u25cf Future sales of equity or equity-related securities;\n\u25cf Changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; and\n\u25cf General financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness include financial and other covenants that will impose restrictions on our financial and business operations.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility contains financial covenants that will require us to maintain a maximum senior secured leverage ratio. These covenants may have a material impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility or the indenture governing Holdings\u2019 $300.0 million of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"), $700.0 million of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes Add-on\"), and $500.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result under the applicable debt instrument.\nEvents beyond our control, such as weather and economic, financial and industry conditions, may affect our ability to continue meeting our financial covenant ratios under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility. The need to comply with these financial covenants and restrictions could limit our ability to execute our strategy and expand our business or prevent us from borrowing more money when necessary.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the indentures governing the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on and the 2027 Notes also contain other events of default customary for financings of these types, including cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, cross acceleration to other indebtedness and certain change of control events. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility could declare outstanding borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility immediately due and payable and the holders of the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on and the 2027 Notes could elect to declare the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on and the 2027 Notes to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We cannot provide assurance we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such indebtedness if it was accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility could also result in an event of default under other indebtedness.\nWe can make no assurances we will be able to comply with these restrictions in the future or that our compliance would not cause us to forego opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nChanges in our credit ratings could adversely affect the price of Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include the sizable attendance and revenue generated from our portfolio of geographically diversified regional theme parks and waterparks, vulnerability to cyclical discretionary consumer spending, and seasonality of our operations. In March 2017, in connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, Moody\u2019s assigned a B2 rating to the 2027 Notes, upgraded the 2024 Notes from B3 to B2, and reaffirmed our Ba1 rating on the credit facility and our B1 corporate family rating. In March 2017, Standard & Poor\u2019s assigned a BB- rating to the 2027 Notes and reaffirmed our BB- rating on the 2024 Notes and our BB corporate credit rating. Moody\u2019s has placed our ratings on \u201cstable outlook.\u201d In January 2020, Standard and Poor\u2019s affirmed all our ratings but revised our rating outlook to negative from stable. We cannot provide assurance our ratings will remain the same. A negative change in our ratings or the perception such a change might occur could adversely affect the market price of Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nHoldings is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries.\nHoldings is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a holding company, it has no significant assets other than its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Holdings is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including the obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on, and the 2027 Notes, and to pay the dividend on Holdings\u2019 common stock. If these dividends and other distributions are not sufficient for Holdings to meets its financial obligations, or not available to Holdings due to restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, it could cause Holdings to default on our debt obligations, which would impair our liquidity and adversely affect our financial condition and our business. We had $174.2 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2019, of which $14.8 million was held at Holdings.\nProvisions in Holdings\u2019 corporate documents and the law of the State of Delaware as well as change of control provisions in certain of our debt and other agreements could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to stockholders or could have a materially negative impact on our business.\nCertain provisions in Holdings\u2019 Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the indentures governing the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes Add-on and the 2027 Notes may have the effect of deterring transactions involving a change in control of us, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.\nHoldings\u2019 Certificate of Incorporation provides for the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors. The authorization of preferred shares empowers Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, to issue preferred shares with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. If issued, the preferred stock could also dilute the holders of Holdings\u2019 common stock and could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.\nHoldings is also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances. All of the foregoing factors could materially and adversely affect the price of Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility contains provisions pursuant to which it is an event of default if any \"person\" becomes the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the common stock. This could deter certain parties from seeking to acquire us and if any \"person\" were to become the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the common stock, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 93423, "SIC": 7996, "TIC": "SIX"}
