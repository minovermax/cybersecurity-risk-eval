The risks described below should carefully be considered together with the other information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to the risk of prolonged weakness in general economic conditions including adverse effects on the overall travel and leisure related industries. Economic conditions currently present or recently present in the United States, Europe and parts of the rest of the world, including high unemployment, erosion of consumer confidence, sovereign debt issues, and financial instability in the global markets, may potentially have negative effects on the travel and leisure industry and on our results of operations. As a result of these and other economic uncertainties, we have experienced and may experience in the future, among other items, a change in booking trends such that guest reservations are made much closer to the actual date of stay, a decrease in the length of stay and a decrease in group bookings. We cannot predict what impact these uncertainties may have on overall travel and leisure or more specifically, on our guest visitation, guest spending or other related trends and the ultimate impact it will have on our results of operations. Additionally, the actual or perceived fear of weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. Skiing, travel and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can entail a relatively high cost of participation and are adversely affected by economic slowdown or recession. This could further be exacerbated by the fact that we charge some of the highest prices for our lift tickets and ancillary services in the ski industry. In the event of a decrease in visitation and overall guest spending we may be required to offer a higher amount of discounts and incentives than we have historically, which would adversely impact our operating results. Our resorts also serve as a destination for international guests. To the extent there are material changes in exchange rates relative to the United States (\"U.S.\") dollar, it could impact the volume of international visitation.\nWe are vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions and the impact of natural disasters. Our ability to attract guests to our resorts is influenced by weather conditions and by the amount and timing of snowfall during the ski season. Unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier visits and our revenue and profits. Unseasonably warm weather may result in inadequate natural snowfall and reduce skiable terrain, which increases the cost of snowmaking and could render snowmaking, wholly or partially, ineffective in maintaining quality skiing conditions, including in areas which are not accessible by snowmaking equipment. In addition, a severe and prolonged drought could affect our otherwise adequate snowmaking water supplies or increase the cost of snowmaking. Excessive natural snowfall may significantly increase the costs incurred to groom trails and may make it difficult for guests to obtain access to our mountain resorts. In the past 20 years, our mountain resorts have averaged between 20 and 39 feet of annual snowfall, which is significantly in excess of the average for United States ski resorts. However, there can be no assurance that our resorts will receive seasonal snowfalls near their historical average in the future. For example, we have experienced very poor conditions in the Lake Tahoe region during the three most recent ski seasons and experienced historic low snowfall across all our resorts during the 2011/2012 ski season. Past snowfall levels or consistency of snow conditions can impact the levels of sales of season passes. Additionally, the early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions can influence the momentum and success of the overall ski season. Unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect our resorts and lodging properties as guests tend to delay or postpone\nvacations if conditions differ from those that typically prevail at such resorts for a given season. There is no way for us to predict future weather patterns or the impact that weather patterns may have on our results of operations or visitation.\nA severe natural disaster, such as a forest fire, may interrupt our operations, damage our properties, reduce the number of guests who visit our resorts in affected areas and negatively impact our revenue and profitability. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair and recoup lost profits. Furthermore, such a disaster may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. The ability to attract visitors to our resorts is also influenced by the aesthetics and natural beauty of the outdoor environment where our resorts are located. A severe forest fire or other severe impacts from naturally occurring events could negatively impact the natural beauty of our resorts and have a long-term negative impact on our overall guest visitation as it would take several years for the environment to recover.\nLeisure and business travel are particularly susceptible to various factors outside of our control, including terrorism, the uncertainty of military conflicts, outbreaks of contagious diseases and the cost and availability of travel options. Our business is sensitive to the willingness of our guests to travel. Acts of terrorism, the spread of contagious diseases, political events and developments in military conflicts in areas of the world from which we draw our guests could depress the public's propensity to travel and cause severe disruptions in both domestic and international air travel and consumer discretionary spending, which could reduce the number of visitors to our resorts and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Many of our guests travel by air and the impact of higher prices for commercial airline services and availability of air services could cause a decrease in visitation by Destination guests to our resorts. A significant portion of our guests also travel by vehicle and higher gasoline prices could adversely impact our guests' willingness to travel to our resorts. Higher cost of travel may also affect the amount that guests are willing to spend at our resorts and could negatively impact our revenue particularly for lodging, ski school, dining and retail/rental.\nOur business is highly seasonal. Our mountain and lodging operations are highly seasonal in nature. In particular, revenue and profits from our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall. Conversely, peak operating seasons for Perisher (acquired on June 30, 2015), GTLC and Flagg Ranch, mountain summer activities/sightseeing and our golf courses generally occur from June to the end of September while the remainder of the year results in operating losses. Revenue and profits generated by Perisher, GTLC and Flagg Ranch, mountain summer activities/sightseeing and golf peak season operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset our off-season losses from our other mountain and lodging operations. For Fiscal 2015, 80% of total combined Mountain and Lodging segment net revenue (excluding Lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs) was earned during our second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality is partially mitigated by the sale of season passes (which for the 2014/2015 ski season accounted for approximately 40% of the total lift revenue) predominately occurring during the period prior to the start of the ski season as the cash from those sales is collected in advance and revenue is mostly recognized in the second and third quarters. In addition, the timing of major holidays can impact vacation patterns and therefore visitation at our mountain resorts and urban ski areas. If we were to experience an adverse event or realize a significant deterioration in our operating results during our peak periods (our fiscal second and third quarters) we would be unable to fully recover any significant declines due to the seasonality of our business. Operating results for any three-month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year (see Note 14, Selected Quarterly Financial Data, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn the fall of 2011, the Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act was enacted into law which clarifies that the Forest Service is authorized to permit year-round recreational activities on land owned by the Forest Service. As such, this will allow our mountain resorts on Forest Service land to offer more summer-season recreational opportunities. We anticipate that if our proposed plans are approved and implemented, that once these summer activities mature, we could realize substantial incremental summer guest visitation and revenue. However, our new summer activities plan may not generate the initial projected revenue and profit margins we expect, and even if our plans are successful, we do not expect that these enhanced summer operations will fully mitigate the seasonal losses that our mountain operations experience from late spring to late fall.\nWe face significant competition. The ski resort and lodging industries are highly competitive. The number of people who ski in the United States (as measured in skier visits) has generally ranged between 51 million and 61 million annually over the last decade, with approximately 53.6 million visits for the 2014/2015 ski season. There are approximately 470 ski areas in the United States that serve local and destination guests, and these ski areas can be more or less impacted by weather conditions based on their location and snowmaking capabilities. The factors that we believe are important to customers include:\n\u2022\nproximity to population centers;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of transportation to ski areas;\n\u2022\nease of travel to ski areas (including direct flights by major airlines);\n\u2022\npricing of lift tickets and/or season passes and the magnitude, quality and price of related ancillary services (ski school, dining and retail/rental), amenities and lodging;\n\u2022\nsnowmaking facilities;\n\u2022\ntype and quality of skiing and snowboarding offered;\n\u2022\nduration of the ski season;\n\u2022\nweather conditions; and\n\u2022\nreputation.\nWe have many competitors for our guests, including other major resorts in Colorado, Utah, California, Nevada, the Pacific Northwest and Southwest and other major destination ski areas worldwide. Our guests can choose from any of these alternatives, as well as non-skiing vacation options and destinations around the world. In addition, other forms of leisure such as sporting events and participation in other competing indoor and outdoor recreational activities are available to potential guests.\nRockResorts hotels, our other hotels and our property management business compete with numerous other hotel and property management companies that may have greater financial resources than we do and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to promotion of their offerings than us. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require us to make continued capital investments in our resorts. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary capital investments to do so, and we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in this market or against such competitors.\nThe high fixed cost structure of mountain resort operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline. The cost structure of our mountain resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including, but not limited to, Forest Service fees, other resort related fees, credit card fees, retail/rental cost of sales and labor, ski school labor and dining operations. Any material declines in the economy, elevated geopolitical uncertainties and/or significant changes in historical snowfall patterns, as well as other risk factors discussed herein could adversely affect revenue. As such, our margins, profits and cash flows may be materially reduced due to declines in revenue given our relatively high fixed cost structure. In addition, increases in wages and other labor costs, energy, healthcare, insurance, transportation and fuel, property taxes, minimum lease payments and other expenses included in our fixed cost structure may also reduce our margin, profits and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to fund resort capital expenditures. We regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate our mountain resorts and properties in order to remain competitive, maintain the value and brand standards of our mountain resorts and properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We cannot always predict where capital will need to be expended in a given fiscal year and capital expenditures can increase due to forces beyond our control. We anticipate that resort capital expenditures will be approximately $110 million to $115 million for calendar year 2015, which excludes any capital expenditures for our Epic Discovery program. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $17 million on new summer activities related to our Epic Discovery program at Vail, Breckenridge and Heavenly. We anticipate future annual capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million (including the recent acquisitions of Park City and Perisher), in addition to adjustments for inflation, the growth in our resorts and future acquisitions. This amount excludes any investment we plan to make in our Epic Discovery program and summer related projects, some of which are subject to regulatory approval. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or to borrow from third parties in the debt or equity markets. We cannot provide assurances that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all. Our ability to generate cash flow and to obtain third-party financing will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour future operating performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and economic conditions affecting the resort industry, the ski industry and the capital markets;\n\u2022\ncompetition; and\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory matters affecting our operations and business;\nAny inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain adequate third-party financing could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects and/or plans.\nWe rely on government permits and landlord approvals. Our resort operations require permits and approvals from certain federal, state, local and foreign authorities, including the Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NPS and the OEH, an agency of the New South Wales government. Virtually all of our ski trails and related activities, including our current and proposed comprehensive summer activities plan, at Vail Mountain, Breckenridge, Keystone, Heavenly, Kirkwood and a\nmajority of Beaver Creek are located on National Forest land. The Forest Service has granted us permits to use these lands, but maintains the right to review and approve many operational matters, as well as the location, design and construction of improvements in these areas. Currently, our permits expire December 31, 2029 for Breckenridge; December 1, 2031 for Vail Mountain; December 31, 2032 for Keystone; November 8, 2039 for Beaver Creek; May 1, 2042 for Heavenly; and, March 1, 2052 for Kirkwood. The Forest Service can terminate or amend these permits if, in its opinion, such termination is required in the public interest. A termination or amendment of any of our permits could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations. In order to undertake improvements and new development, we must apply for permits and other approvals. These efforts, if unsuccessful, could impact our expansion efforts. Furthermore, Congress may materially increase the fees we pay to the Forest Service for use of these National Forest lands. The Forest Service is in the process of developing SUP language that may burden our water rights or require us to transfer ownership of some water rights used within ski area SUP boundaries. Once the new SUP language is finalized, the Forest Service will have the right to amend our existing SUPs to include this new language. The new permit language may substantially impair the value of or our ability to fully use existing water rights at Breckenridge, Vail Mountain, Keystone, Beaver Creek or Heavenly and may make it difficult to acquire new sources of water in the future. Additionally, our operations at Northstar and our Utah resorts are conducted pursuant to long-term leases with third parties who require us to operate the resorts in accordance with the terms of the leases and seek certain approvals from the respective landlords for improvements made to the resorts. The initial lease term for Northstar with affiliates of CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. expires in January 2027, and allows for three 10-year renewal options. We entered into a transaction agreement, master lease agreement and ancillary transaction documents with affiliate companies of Talisker Corporation (\"Talisker\"), the initial lease term for our Utah resorts with Talisker expires in May 2063, and allows for six 50-year renewal options. We have a lease and a license for Perisher within the Kosciusko National Park which expires in June 2048, with an option to renew for an additional period of 20 years. Perisher relies on a suite of planning approvals (and existing use rights) granted under the Australian EPA Act to operate the resort. Strategic planning documents have been adopted to provide a framework for the assessment and approval of future development at the resort, some of which are due to be updated in 2016. Perisher also holds a number of environmental approvals to regulate its operations, including an environment protection license and a suite of dangerous goods licenses related to the storage of diesel, heating oil and propane in storage tanks across the resort. Additionally, GTLC and Flagg Ranch operate under concessionaire agreements with the NPS that expire on December 31, 2021 and October 31, 2026, respectively. There is no guarantee that at the end of the initial lease/license or agreements under which we operate our resorts we will renew or, if desired, be able to negotiate new terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, our resorts that operate on privately-owned land are subject to local land use regulation and oversight by county and/or town government and may not be able to obtain the requisite approvals needed for resort improvements or expansions. Failure to comply with the provisions, obligations and terms (including renewal requirements and deadlines) of our material permits and leases could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of business. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air emissions, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes and other liquids, land use, remediation of contaminated sites, protection of natural resources such as wetlands, and sustainable visitor or tourist use and enjoyment. For example, future expansions of certain of our mountain facilities must comply with applicable forest plans approved under the National Forest Management Act, federal, state and foreign wildlife protection laws or local zoning requirements. In addition, most projects to improve, upgrade or expand our ski areas are subject to environmental review under the NEPA, the CEQA, the Australian NPW Act or the Australian EPA Act, as applicable. The NEPA and CEQA require the Forest Service, or other governmental entities, to study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include various alternatives in its analysis. Our ski area improvement proposals may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project. Our facilities are subject to risks associated with mold and other indoor building contaminants. From time to time our operations are subject to inspections by environmental regulators or other regulatory agencies. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental, health and safety requirements. However, our efforts to comply do not eliminate the risk that we may be held liable, incur fines or be subject to claims for damages, and that the amount of any liability, fines, damages or remediation costs may be material for, among other things, the presence or release of regulated materials at, on or emanating from properties we now or formerly owned or operated, newly discovered environmental impacts or contamination at or from any of our properties, or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their enforcement.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business. We depend on the use of sophisticated information technology and systems for central reservations, point of sale, procurement, administration and technologies we make available to our guests. We must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to adapt our infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands and to respond to competitive service and product offerings.\nIn addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner. Delays or difficulties implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and could decrease the quality of service we offer to our guests. Also, we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future. If any of these events occur, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. We collect and retain guest data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for various business purposes, including transactional marketing and promotional purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and privacy of our guest and employee information is very important to us, and our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests.\nDespite our efforts, information networks and systems are vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of sophisticated cyber attacks on network and information systems, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. We have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. Although we have taken, and continue to take steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal controls, there can be no assurance that a system interruption, security breach or unauthorized access will not occur. Any such interruption, breach or unauthorized access to our network or systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us.\nWe are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. We are, from time to time, subject to various asserted or unasserted legal proceedings and claims. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. While we believe we have adequate insurance coverage and/or accrue for loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, we cannot assure you that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of our brands, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could have an adverse impact on our business. A negative public image or other adverse events could affect the reputation of one or more of our mountain resorts, other destination resorts, hotel properties and other businesses or more generally impact the reputation of our brands. If the reputation or perceived quality of our brands declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted. The unauthorized use of our trademarks could also diminish the value of our brands and their market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nThere is a risk of accidents occurring at our mountain resorts or competing mountain resorts which may reduce visitation and negatively impact our operations. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our resorts, services and activities, including summer activities, and our corporate and management integrity. While we maintain and promote an on-mountain safety program, there are inherent risks associated with our resort activities. An accident or an injury at any of our resorts or at resorts operated by competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and employees that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence in us, reduce visitation at our resorts, and negatively impact our results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations.\nWe depend on a seasonal workforce. Our mountain and lodging operations are highly dependent on a large seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing needs each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. We cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce will not be necessary in the future. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee\nthat we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our workforce, including increased labor costs. We are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation and other working conditions, work authorization requirements, discrimination and family and medical leave. Labor costs and labor-related benefits are primary components in the cost of our operations. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could increase our labor costs. Also, during Fiscal 2015, we announced our plans to implement a Company-wide minimum wage in the United States of $10.00 per hour across all lines of business (except for employees at GTLC, the minimum wage will be $8.50 per hour because these employees also receive an employee housing benefit) effective September 2015. This is a wage above current minimum wages in all states where we operate. Our intention is also to raise this minimum wage by inflation each year going forward. As minimum wage rates increase, including further potential federal and state legislative changes to the minimum wage rate, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above the minimum wage. These potential labor impacts could adversely impact our financial results.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel, our business may suffer. The success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of key management personnel, including our senior executive officers. If any of these persons were to leave, it could be difficult to replace them, and our business could be harmed. We do not maintain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on any of our employees.\nOur acquisitions or future acquisitions might not be successful. We have acquired certain mountain resorts, hotel properties and other businesses complementary to our own, as well as developable land in proximity to our resorts. Acquisitions are complex to evaluate, execute and integrate. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately evaluate or successfully integrate and manage acquired mountain resorts, properties and businesses and increase our profits from these operations. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and intend to actively pursue acquisition opportunities, some of which could be significant. As a result, we face various risks from acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nour evaluation of the synergies and/or long-term benefits of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nour inability to integrate acquired businesses into our operations as planned;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management's attention;\n\u2022\npotential increased debt leverage;\n\u2022\nlitigation arising from acquisition activity;\n\u2022\npotential goodwill or other intangible asset impairments; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated problems or liabilities.\nIn addition, we run the risk that any new acquisitions may fail to perform in accordance with expectations, and that estimates of the costs of improvements and integration for such properties may prove inaccurate.\nWe may not realize all the anticipated financial benefits from Park City and Canyons. In May 2013, we entered into a long-term lease to assume the resort operations of Canyons, including its ski area and related amenities, and the ski terrain of Park City (excluding the base area), which was subject to litigation. In September 2014, we acquired the resort operations of Park City (including the base area) and entered into ancillary transaction documents that provided for, among other things, the settlement of the litigation related to the ski terrain of Park City. Following the acquisition, the Park City ski terrain, which was previously subject to litigation, was incorporated into the Canyons lease under the existing terms of the lease. The Canyons lease has an initial term of 50 years with six 50-year renewal options and annual payments of $25 million. The lease payment is subject to annual increases based upon the increase in the CPI index less 1%, with a floor of 2% per year. As lease payments increase annually, we may be adversely impacted to the extent these increases are not offset by increases in cash flow generated from operations. We also anticipate realizing significant tax benefits which are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be inadequate.\nIn addition, the Canyons lease requires us to pay participating contingent payments to Talisker equal to 42% of the amount by which EBITDA for the resort operations of both Canyons and Park City exceeds $35 million, which increases annually based upon the increase in the CPI index plus a 10% adjustment for any capital improvements or investments made under the lease by us, including the purchase price for Park City. We are required to measure at each reporting period the fair value of the future estimated participating contingent payments and record the change in fair value in our income (loss) from operations. This change in fair value of participating contingent payments could provide significant fluctuations in our operating results in a particular period.\nExchange rate fluctuations could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results. In June 2015, we acquired Perisher in Australia. We are exposed to currency translation risk because the results of Perisher are reported in local currency, which we then translate to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates, in particular the Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar, affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We currently do not enter into hedging arrangements to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of Perisher increases.\nWe may be required to write-off a portion of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible asset and/or long-lived asset balances as a result of prolonged weakness in economic conditions. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets below book value and we evaluate long-lived assets (including real estate held for sale) for potential impairment whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of our reporting units and terminal values of the businesses using projected future levels of income, as well as business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions. We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams (see \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K). We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows using projected future levels of income. However, if lower than projected levels of cash flows were to occur due to prolonged abnormal weather conditions or a prolonged weakness in general economic conditions, among other risk factors, it could cause less than expected growth and/or a reduction in terminal values and cash flows and could result in an impairment charge attributable to certain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or long-lived assets, negatively impacting our results of operations and stockholders' equity.\nWe are subject to accounting regulations and use certain accounting estimates and judgments that may differ significantly from actual results. Implementation of existing and future legislation, rulings, standards and interpretations from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other regulatory bodies could affect the presentation of our financial statements and related disclosures. Future regulatory requirements could significantly change our current accounting practices and disclosures. Such changes in the presentation of our financial statements and related disclosures could change an investor's interpretation or perception of our financial position and results of operations.\nWe use many methods, estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies (see \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur stock price is highly volatile. The market price of our stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchange in valuations, including our real estate held for sale;\n\u2022\nchanges in the overall travel, gaming, hospitality and leisure industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors or such guidance provided by us;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or companies in the travel, gaming, hospitality and leisure industries of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, plans, prospects, service offerings or operating results;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities;\n\u2022\ntrading and volume fluctuations;\n\u2022\nother risk factors as discussed above; and\n\u2022\nother unforeseen events.\nStock markets in the United States have often experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions including acts of terrorism, military conflicts, prolonged economic uncertainty, a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase dividend payments and/or pay dividends. In fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors approved the commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at an annual rate of $0.60 per share, subject to quarterly declaration. Since the initial commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend, our Board of Directors has annually approved an increase to our cash dividend on our common stock. On March 11, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 50% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.6225 per share, subject to quarterly declaration. This dividend is anticipated to be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand. Although we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and is limited by applicable state law concepts of available funds for distribution, as well as contractual restrictions. As a result, the amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, restrictions contained in our senior credit facility, the Seventh Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), any future contractual restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors may also suspend the payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment in Vail Resorts, Inc. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nAnti-takeover provisions affecting us could prevent or delay a change of control that is beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, provisions of our debt instruments and other agreements and provisions of applicable Delaware law and applicable federal and state regulations may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that holders of our securities may consider favorable. These provisions could:\n\u2022\ndelay, defer or prevent a change in control of our Company;\n\u2022\ndiscourage bids for our securities at a premium over the market price;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our securities; or\n\u2022\nimpede the ability of the holders of our securities to change our management.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. As of July 31, 2015, we had $816.8 million of outstanding indebtedness. This amount includes $317.5 million for the Canyons Lease obligation. This amount also consists of $250.0 million of borrowings from the term loan facility under our Credit Agreement to redeem the outstanding aggregate principal amounts of our 6.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (\u201c6.50% Notes\u201d) and Industrial Development Bonds in May 2015, and $185.0 million borrowings under the revolver portion of our Credit Agreement to fund the acquisition of Perisher in June 2015 and seasonal liquidity needs. Our borrowings under our senior credit facility are subject to interest rate changes substantially increasing our risk to changes in interest rates. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including the term loan facility, currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25% on an annual basis. Interest rate margins may fluctuate based upon the ratio of our Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing four-quarter basis. We also have, on a cumulative basis, minimum lease payment obligations under operating leases of approximately $292.0 million as of July 31, 2015. Our level of indebtedness and minimum lease payment obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, including the annual payments under the Canyons lease, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, real estate developments, marketing efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our senior credit facility do not fully prohibit us from doing so. If we incur additional debt, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nThere are restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our senior credit facility may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other\nbusiness activities and strategic initiatives that may be in our long-term best interests. For example, the senior credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or sell preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends, repurchase our stock and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain types of investments;\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022\nenter into sales-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nissue guarantees of debt;\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions; and\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that we will meet the financial covenants contained in our senior credit facility. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants, or suffer a material adverse change which restricts our borrowing ability under our senior credit facility, we would not be able to borrow funds thereunder without a waiver. Any inability to borrow could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a breach, if uncured, could cause a default under the senior credit facility and our other debt. Our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.", "PERMNO": 84588, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "MTN"}
