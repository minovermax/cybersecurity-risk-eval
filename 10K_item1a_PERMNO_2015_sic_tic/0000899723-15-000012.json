Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant risks that our business faces. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions.\nOverall demand for our products and our profitability may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including inflationary or deflationary pressures; interest rates; access to and functioning of capital markets; consumer and business spending rates; and higher commodity, raw material and fuel costs. Current uncertainty regarding global economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our products, reduced profitability, and increased payment delays or defaults. We are limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn in light of certain fixed costs associated with our operations.\nWe may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry or in our customers' products.\nOur future business success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our technological capabilities, develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. Moreover, technological and other changes in our customers' products or processes may render some of our products obsolete, which would reduce the demand for those products. In addition, technical advances by competitors may lead to production of less expensive or more effective products which could reduce our future sales.\nWe may not be able to execute upon our competitive repositioning and cost optimization opportunities.\nIn February 2015, we announced a wide-ranging set of competitive repositioning and cost optimization opportunities throughout the enterprise that are expected to improve our ability to serve customers, compete in global markets and\ndeliver stronger financial performance. Achieving the targeted savings from these opportunities within the expected time and cost parameters is dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with employee unions and works councils. The implementation of these opportunities could disrupt our operations. If we cannot implement these opportunities without disrupting our operations, or if the assumptions used to estimate the costs, benefits and timing of these opportunities are incorrect, our business and financial results could be adversely affected and we could achieve different results than those initially projected.\nOur Battery Technologies segment maintains contracts with the United States Government and is subject to government regulations, uncertain levels of funding, modifications due to changes in customer priorities and potential termination.\nU.S. Government contracts are subject to specific regulations including those related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. These laws impact how we transact business with our governmental clients and, in some instances, impose significant costs on our business operations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting which would reduce our sales and profits. Non-compliance with government regulations could also result in financial penalties, disallowed payments to us, and criminal prosecution.\nThe funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. We cannot predict the extent to which funding will be provided as part of the budget ultimately approved by Congress. In the event that appropriations for any of our or our customers' programs are impacted, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to sequestration, military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on related programs.\nWe intend to seek additional acquisitions, but we may not be able to identify attractive targets, complete transactions, or successfully integrate acquired companies, which could adversely affect our strategy.\nOur strategy anticipates growth partly through future acquisitions; however, our ability to identify and consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources and our ability to obtain financing. Our success in integrating newly-acquired businesses could be compromised if we fail to retain key personnel or fail to execute effective integration plans. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated, and it is also possible that expected synergies from future acquisitions may not materialize. We also may incur costs and divert management attention for potential acquisitions that are never consummated. Acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities.\nThere may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to properly determine during the due diligence investigation and for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible. Indemnities and warranties obtained from the seller may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope, amount, duration, financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor or other reasons.\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur key personnel are critical to the management and direction of our businesses. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key personnel and other capable management personnel. It is particularly important that we retain our senior management group that is responsible for implementing our strategy. If we were not able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, we may not successfully execute our strategy.\nThe majority of our operations are outside the United States, which subjects us to risks that may adversely affect our operating results.\nConducting business outside the U.S subjects us to risks related to the differing legal and regulatory requirements and the social, political and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. These risks include currency rate fluctuations; labor difficulties; difficulty collecting receivables and longer customer payment cycles; unexpected additional taxes, tariffs, restrictions on capital flows, restrictions on trade; and changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements. Furthermore, unexpected devaluations of currencies in developing or emerging markets could negatively affect the value of our earnings from, and of the assets located in, those markets.\nWe engage in business in certain countries where the risk of public sector corruption and bribery is high. We have implemented policies and procedures and conducted employee training to assure that our operations are in compliance\nwith anti-corruption laws. If our compliance actions fail, a violation of anti-corruption laws could result in serious penalties, including criminal and civil sanctions.\nWe are at risk from fluctuations in the price and uncertainties in the supply of certain raw materials.\nNickel, cobalt and certain rare earth materials, primarily dysprosium and neodymium, are the primary raw materials used by Magnetic Technologies. Fluctuations in the price of rare earth materials and other raw materials have been significant in the past and we believe price fluctuations are possible in the future. Our ability to pass increases in raw material costs through to our customers by increasing the selling prices of our products is an important factor in our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain an appropriate differential between customer prices and our costs at all times, which could lead to reduced profitability. In addition, we may be required under US generally accepted accounting policies (\"US GAAP\") accounting rules to write down the carrying value of our inventory when rare earth and other raw material prices decrease, which could reduce our profit margins.\nRare earth materials are available from a limited number of suppliers, primarily in China. Political instability and unexpected adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including with respect to export duties, quotas or embargoes, may affect the market price and availability of raw materials, including rare earth materials, particularly from China. If a substantial interruption should occur in the supply of rare earth materials, we may not be able to obtain other sources of supply in a timely fashion or at a reasonable price. A substantial increase in the price or an interruption in supply of rare earth materials may cause our customers to look for substitute materials or processes which could lead to reduced demand for our products.\nThe level of returns on pension plan assets and changes in the actuarial assumptions used could adversely affect us.\nOur operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. US GAAP requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets, and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous jurisdictions outside of the United States. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions with different tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the timing and amounts of funds repatriated to the U.S., and changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles and interpretations.\nWe are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, resulting in a material reduction of net income.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental regulation that could cause us to incur unanticipated costs or liabilities and could affect sales of our products.\nWe have expended, and may be required to expend in the future, substantial funds for compliance with laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, disposal, emission and discharge of materials into the environment. In addition, we may from time to time be subjected to claims for personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages made by third parties or regulators. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims or fully anticipating the scope of unknown contamination and remediation, our current reserves\nmay prove to be insufficient.\nIn addition, new or revised governmental regulations relating to health, safety and the environment may affect demand for our products. Such new or revised regulations may result in heightened concerns about the materials involved and in additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, or labeling of these materials and may increase the cost of producing them, transporting them and/or limit the use of such materials or products containing such materials, which could lead to a decrease in demand. As a result of these regulations, customers may avoid purchasing some products in favor of perceived environmentally sensitive, less hazardous or less costly alternatives.\nOur financial condition could be negatively impacted if we fail to maintain sufficient cash in the United States.\nThe majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside the United States. If a substantial amount of cash were required in the United States for debt repayment, capital expenditures or other initiatives including future acquisitions, we may be required to repatriate funds to the United States with potentially unfavorable tax consequences or otherwise finance the desired activity.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our trade secrets and proprietary information, but it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information and develop similar technologies. If a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, making the outcome uncertain. Even if we are successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenges could be costly and could divert management's attention.\nBecause we depend on several large customers for a significant portion of our revenues, our operating results could be adversely affected by any disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in their businesses.\nWe depend on several large customers for a significant portion of our business. For example, sales to the top three customers in the Battery Technologies segment represented approximately half of Battery Technologies' net sales in 2013 and 2014. Any disruption in our relationships with our major customers, including any adverse modification of our agreements with them or their unwillingness or inability to perform their obligations under the agreements, could adversely affect us. In addition, any material adverse change in the financial condition of any of our major customers could have similar adverse effects on us.\nWe operate in very competitive industries.\nWe have many competitors. Some of our principal competitors have greater financial resources, greater brand recognition, or are operating in lower cost environments. Accordingly, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result of the competitive environment in the markets in which we operate, we currently face and will continue to face pressure on the sales prices of our products from competitors and large customers. With these pricing pressures, we may experience future reductions in the profit margins on our sales, or may be unable to pass on future raw material price or operating cost increases to our customers, or incur to a sudden loss of business.\nWe believe that industry consolidation among our peers could result in stronger competitors with greater financial and other resources that are better able to compete for customers.\nFuture indebtedness may impair our ability to operate our business successfully.\nThe terms of our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility the (\"Facility\") could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. This Facility contains various provisions that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, or sell assets. These restrictions could place us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors. In addition future borrowings could expose us to material increases in interest expense since future borrowings will have variable interest rate provisions.\nIn addition, our Facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios, satisfy certain financial condition tests, and repay our indebtedness when it becomes due. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet these requirements. We cannot assure that we will meet those requirements or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those requirements. A breach of any of these covenants or any other restrictive covenants contained in our Facility would result in an event of default. An event of default could result in the holders of the affected indebtedness declaring all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts or secure new financing, the Facility\nlenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them, which is a substantial portion of our assets.\nAny impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.\nOur total assets include substantial intangible assets, including goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends continue, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill or intangibles impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material.\nExtended business interruption at our key facilities could have an adverse impact on operating results.\nOur results of operations are dependent in large part upon our ability to produce and deliver products promptly upon receipt of orders. Our facilities in Germany, the United States, and Taiwan are critical to our business, and any damage to or other conditions significantly interfering with the operation of our facilities, such as an interruption of our supply lines or work stoppages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79724, "SIC": 3341, "TIC": "OMG"}
