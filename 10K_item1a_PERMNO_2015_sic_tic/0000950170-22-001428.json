{"cik": "1338749", "company": "POTLATCHDELTIC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. While the risks described below have been identified by management as the most material to the company, they are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The risks described below should carefully be considered together with the other information contained in this report.\nIndustry and Business Risks\nEconomic Conditions\nThe cyclical nature of our business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe financial performance of our operations is affected by the cyclical nature of our business. The markets for manufactured wood products and real estate are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. Our business is particularly dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market, and specifically demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions, changes in employment levels, consumer confidence, financial markets, interest rates, credit availability (including homebuyers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgages), supply chain disruptions, availability of labor and developable land, inflation, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. Historical prices for our manufactured wood products have been volatile as a result of demand, particularly in recent years, and we have limited direct influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our manufactured wood products. In our Timberlands business, our sawlog price realizations in Idaho are subject to fluctuation in lumber prices as we index a significant portion of these sawlogs under long-term supply agreements on a four-week lag to lumber prices. The demand for real estate can be affected by changes in factors, such as interest rates, credit availability, economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, limited wage growth, any weakening of consumer confidence and the availability of developable land, as well as by the impact of federal, state and local land use and environmental protection laws. The potential effect of these factors on our future operational and financial performance is highly uncertain, unpredictable and outside our control. As a result, our past performance may not be indicative of future results.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nPandemic issues, including the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to public health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and its variants. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions across the United States including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and conduct our business operations. As a result, the pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, significant volatility in capital markets and economic disruption such as periodic adverse fluctuations on the demand and pricing for our logs, wood products and real estate properties, personnel absences, disruptions to our supply chain and the manufacturing and distribution of our timber and wood products. Our suppliers, third-party logging and hauling and shipping contractors and customers have also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed deliveries of raw materials, products and services, reduced, or canceled orders, rising commodity prices, increased freight, and increased collection risks.\nWe are actively monitoring the potential impacts on our operations, workforce, supply chain and our consolidated results of operations as a result of the continued spread of the COVID-19 variants and continue to adjust production where possible to match demand. However, our predictions about the impact that COVID-19 or other viral outbreaks will have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations may not be accurate as they depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Such developments include, but are not limited to, the severity of the virus\u2019s impact on the economy, recent increases in inflation and the extent such increases will continue, housing demand, new residential construction and home repair and remodeling activity, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of rail and trucking to transport our products to our customers, the future geographic spread or mutation of COVID-19 or the outbreak of another virulent disease, continuation of or changes in governmental responses to disease outbreak, the duration of disease outbreak, the timing and effectiveness of treatment and testing options, availability and distribution of a vaccine, consequential restrictions, business disruptions, the effectiveness of responsive actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain the disease and actions that may be taken by our competitors, suppliers or customers.\nWhile several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and are available for use in the United States, we are unable to predict how widely utilized the vaccines ultimately will be, whether they will be effective in preventing the symptoms and spread of COVID-19 (including its variant strains), and when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume. These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The continuation of the pandemic or expanded or recurring outbreaks could exacerbate the adverse impact of such measures. Any requirements to mandate COVID-19 vaccination of our workforce or require our unvaccinated employees to be tested regularly in the jurisdictions in which we operate could be difficult and costly, and could result in labor disruptions, employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs.\nCommodity Products\nOur wood products are commodities that are widely available from other producers. Failure to compete effectively in our markets could adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control, and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs. These costs can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, changes in demand, supply chain disruptions and inflation or deflation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe markets for our wood products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our lines of business. In addition, our Wood Products facilities are relatively capital intensive, which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs. These conditions have contributed to substantial price competition, particularly during periods of reduced demand. Some of our wood products competitors may currently be lower-cost producers than we are or may benefit from weak currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and, accordingly, these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases. Wood products also are subject to significant competition from a variety of substitute products, including non-wood and engineered wood products. To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressure from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adversely affected.\nCompetition from wood product imports can vary significantly and have a material effect on U.S. wood product pricing.\nThe future volume and pricing of lumber imports entering U.S. markets remain uncertain. Historically, Canada has been the most significant source of lumber imports to the U.S. market. For decades, the U.S. and Canada have been in a dispute over pricing for softwood lumber entering the U.S., which has resulted in trade cases and negotiated agreements between the two countries. The U.S. and Canada signed a Softwood Lumber Agreement in 2006, which expired in October 2015. On November 25, 2016, the U.S. lumber industry filed a petition seeking injury determination with the U.S. International Trade Commission, and a petition seeking countervailing (CVD) and anti-dumping (AD) duties on Canadian lumber imports with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Final rulings on injury and CVD and AD duties went into effect on December 28, 2017 resulting in the combined CVD and AD cash deposit rate to be paid by most Canadian exporters initially established at 20.23%. The most recent annual administrative review covering 2019 was completed in November 2021 resulting in the CVD and AD combined rate of 17.90%. The U.S. Department of Commerce has begun preliminary work on its third administrative review, which will cover 2020. A final decision on that review is not expected until late 2022. The Government of Canada continues to appeal the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission supporting the AD/CVD duties as well as to challenge these duties in the World Trade Organization.\nWe are not able to predict when, or if, a new softwood lumber agreement will be reached or, if reached, what the terms of the agreement would be. Similarly, we are not able to predict if the current U.S. policy of imposing import duties on Canadian softwood lumber will continue. We could, therefore, experience significant downward pressure on lumber prices caused by Canadian imports.\nThird-Party Logging and Hauling Contractors\nOur operations are affected by third-party logger availability, transportation availability and changes in costs from these third parties.\nOur Timberlands business depends on the availability of third-party logging and hauling contractors. Our Wood Products business depends on third-party transportation providers, including railcar and truck transportation. Our timberlands are located primarily in rural areas where skilled logging and hauling labor availability may be limited. As a result of weak business conditions in the timber industry that persisted for several years following the Great Recession, there are fewer logging and hauling contractors in certain markets to harvest and deliver our logs. This shortage has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and, in some cases, compromised the general availability of these contractors. Any increase in harvest levels due to significant and/or extended increased demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of third-party logging and hauling contractors. This, in turn, could increase the cost of log supply and delivery, or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to harvest our timber and deliver our logs to market.\nAdditionally, our third-party contractors are subject to several events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure, labor issues, increased competition for loggers, truck drivers and railcar availability. Logger and truck driver shortages or failures of a third-party transportation provider to timely deliver our products to our mills and our customers, could harm our supply chain, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our reputation. Further, increases in the cost of labor or fuel could negatively impact our financial results by increasing the cost of these services and could also result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services.\nTimberlands Operations\nOur operating results and cash flows are materially affected by the supply and demand for timber.\nA variety of factors affect prices and demand for timber including changes in availability at the local, national and international level, all of which can vary by region, timber type (sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and species. On a local level, supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires. Our timberlands are primarily located in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result, we may be susceptible to adverse economic and other developments in these regions, including industry slowdowns, mill closures and curtailments, business layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, changes in demographics, increases in real estate and other taxes and increased regulation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, as the demand for paper nationwide continues to decline, closures and curtailment of pulp mills have adversely affected the demand and pricing for pulpwood and wood chips in certain regions in which we operate. Also, demand in other parts of the world may affect timber prices in the markets in which we compete. For example, although we do not sell into the Asian markets, Asian demand can indirectly impact pricing and supply in North American timber and lumber markets.\nIn Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, most timberlands are privately owned. Historically, increases in timber prices have often resulted in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial logging operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that has tended to moderate price increases. Decreases in log prices have often resulted in lower harvest levels, causing short-term decreases in supply that have tended to moderate price decreases. In the South, timber growth rates have exceeded harvests during the past decade. This condition has led to an oversupply of harvestable timber in the region, which has kept timber prices at relatively low levels.\nIn Idaho, a greater proportion of timberland is government owned as compared to the southern states where we operate. For more than 20 years environmental concerns and other factors have limited timber sales by federal agencies, which historically had been major suppliers of timber to the U.S. forest products industry, particularly in the West. Any reversal of policy that substantially increases timber sales from government owned land, including opening federal lands to thinning and additional harvesting to reduce fire risks, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to harvest timber or we may elect to reduce harvest levels due to market, weather, climate change and regulatory conditions, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur timber harvest levels and sales may be limited due to weather impacting timber growth cycles and restrictions on access, availability of contract loggers, mill closures and curtailments and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources. Future timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas as a result of other factors, including availability of labor, insufficient or excessive precipitation, damage by fire, pest infestation, disease and natural disasters, significant regional or local weather events such as ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized, affecting only a limited percentage of our timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will be limited. Severe weather conditions and other natural disasters can also reduce seedling survival rates, impact the productivity of timberlands and disrupt the harvesting and delivery of logs. Our financial results and cash flows are dependent to a significant extent on our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels. As is typical in the forest industry, we assume all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards because insurance for such losses is either not available or is cost prohibitive to maintain. Consequently, a reduction in our timber inventory from such events could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. In addition, the geographic concentration of our property makes us more susceptible to adverse impacts from a single natural disaster, temporary or permanent closures of wood product facilities that purchase our logs and other factors that could negatively impact our timber production.\nWe typically experience seasonally lower harvest activity during the winter and early spring due to weather conditions. On a short-term basis, we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions. Longer term, our timber harvest levels will be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands, sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another. In addition, future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control.\nOur estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates, which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.\nWhether in connection with managing our existing timberlands or assessing potential timberland acquisitions, we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories. These include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested, timber growth rates and end-product yields. Timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property. These estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests, revenues and expected cash flows. However, future growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain and subject to many external variables that could further affect their accuracy including, among other things, disease, infestation, natural disasters, changes in weather patterns and changes in product merchandizing specifications. If these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be adversely affected.\nWood Products Operations\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could unexpectedly cease to operate due to a number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages, prolonged power failures, equipment failures, raw material shortages, equipment and maintenance part shortages, cyber-attacks, labor difficulties or labor availability due to quarantine requirements for those exposed to flu or viruses, such as COVID-19 and its variants, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels, fire such as the fire at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill in June 2021, ice storms, floods, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes or other catastrophes, terrorism or threats of terrorism, governmental regulations and other operational problems.\nWe cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage. Downtime and facility damage have prevented us and could prevent us in the future from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damages and business interruption losses resulting from events such as fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes and catastrophic equipment failure. For example, our Ola, Arkansas sawmill was damaged by fire in June 2021 and we have adequate property and business interruption insurance, subject to an applicable deductible, to cover this event. However, such insurance may not be sufficient or may be cost prohibitive to cover all our damages and losses in the future.\nReal Estate Operations\nChanges in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.\nA number of factors, including availability of credit, a slowing of residential and commercial real estate development, availability of funding to support conservation land purchases by governmental and other entities, zoning rules, population shifts, types and location of land available for sale and changes in demographics could reduce the demand for our real estate and negatively affect our results of operations. Changes in investor interest in purchasing timberlands could reduce our ability to execute sales of non-core timberlands and could also negatively affect our results of operations. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of current laws, or the enactment of new laws, regarding the use and development of real estate, or changes in the political composition of federal, state and local governmental bodies could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our real estate business, profitability or financial condition.\nThe majority of our real estate development projects are concentrated in few markets.\nWe have real estate development projects located in Central Arkansas, specifically, in and west of Little Rock, Arkansas and in Hot Springs, Arkansas. These real estate operations are particularly vulnerable to economic downturns, weather or other adverse events that may occur in this specific region and to competition from nearby commercial and residential housing developments. Our results of operations may be affected by the cyclicality of the homebuilding and real estate industries. Factors influencing these industries include changes in population growth, general and local economic conditions, weather, climate impacts, employment levels, consumer confidence and income, housing demand, new and existing housing inventory levels, the availability of developable land, availability and cost of financing, mortgage interest rates and foreclosures, and changes in government regulation regarding the environment, zoning, real estate taxes, and other local government fees. In addition, the tightening of credit and economic recession could delay or deter commercial and residential real estate activity and may affect our operating results.\nLegal, Environmental and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nOur businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing:\n\u2022air emissions,\n\u2022harvesting,\n\u2022silvicultural activities, including use of pesticides and herbicides,\n\u2022surface water management\n\u2022the cleanup of contaminated sites,\n\u2022building codes, and\n\u2022health and safety matters.\nWe have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We also have incurred and could incur in the future substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations on properties we currently own or have owned in the past. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws and our compliance costs could increase materially. In addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. Future compliance with existing and new laws and requirements may disrupt our business operations and require significant expenditures.\nAs the owner and operator of land, we have been and may be in the future liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations we currently own or have owned and operated in the past. In addition, we lease some of our properties to third-party operators for the purpose of exploring, extracting, developing and producing oil and gas in exchange for fees and royalty payments. These operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other chemicals into the air, soil or water. Generally, these third-party operators indemnify us against any such liability, and we require that that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them. However, if for any reason an unlawful discharge occurs and our third-party operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation, or if the required liability insurance was not in effect, then it is possible that we could be held responsible for costs associated with environmental liability caused by such third-party operators. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our current or previously owned sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs.\nSimilarly, threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. A number of species on our timberlands have been, and in the future may be, protected under these laws. If current or future regulations, including increased mandates for biodiversity, increased wildlife habitats, additional species on our lands classified as endangered, or the enforcement of endangered species regulations become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.\nClimate Conditions\nChanges in climate conditions and governmental responses to such changes may affect our operations or planned or future growth activities.\nClimate change represents an urgent global challenge that has the potential to cause significant disruptions to our business and results of operations, cash flows and profitability. We are committed to do our part to mitigate climate change, and we believe that working forests are part of the solution. Scientific research supports that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, snow and ice storms, the spread of disease, and insect infestations. Global temperature increases can result in significant regional differences in weather patterns that affect tree growth. Further, changes in precipitation resulting in droughts have made and could make in the future wildfires more frequent or more severe. Any of these natural disasters could affect our timberlands, timber growth rates, productivity of our timberlands, our harvest operations or cause variations in the cost and supply of raw materials.\nIncreasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, human capital, labor, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for us, may alter the environment in which we do business, and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance. Additionally, environmental groups or interested parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, harvesting timber under contract with federal or state agencies, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit, or even a threatened lawsuit, could delay harvesting on our timberlands or impact our ability to operate or invest in our Wood Products facilities.\nWe anticipate increased future legislative regulations at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. Executive orders issued by the current U.S. presidential administration, including an executive order issued on January 27, 2021, focusing on climate change, are evidence of the current U.S. government's intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. We manage our manufacturing facilities and timberland operations to comply with applicable laws and regulations. It is possible that legislation or government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could affect renewals or modifications to permits at our facilities, or result in significantly higher energy and compliance costs, and increased capital expenditures.\nFuture legislative regulations could also limit harvest levels for commercial timberland operators, which could in turn adversely affect our timberland operations as well as potentially lead to significant increases in capital investments, the cost of energy, wood fiber and other raw materials for our Wood Products facilities. Any one or more of these developments, as well as other unforeseeable governmental responses to climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and profitability. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to our manufacturing facilities to meet and exceed anticipated regulations, there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that regulation in the future will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our capital investments. Failure to successfully manage new or pending regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal Matters\nLegal matters, disputes and proceedings (collectively \u201clegal matters\u201d), if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in legal matters, disputes and proceedings (legal matters). It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some legal matters or that we may agree to settle a matter, and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it. In some cases, all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance; in other cases, any such losses will not be covered by insurance.\nIndebtedness and Capital Structure Risks\nAccess to Capital\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth.\nOur ability to finance growth is dependent to a significant degree on external sources of capital. Our ability to access such capital on favorable terms could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends. For additional details, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us and the failure to obtain necessary capital could materially adversely affect our future growth.\nIndebtedness\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends to stockholders and fulfill our debt obligations, our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs.\nOur debt requires interest and principal payments. At December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding long-term debt of $762.2 million. Subject to the limits contained in our debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\nOur indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences for stockholders. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.\nThe alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nA number of our debt instruments and associated interest rate derivative agreements have an interest rate tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that the US Dollar LIBOR will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has recommended replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex. Once LIBOR is no longer available as a reference rate, we will have to modify our variable debt and interest rate derivative agreements to adopt an alternative benchmark. Further, if our lenders or interest rate swap counterparties have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates from our variable debt and interest rate derivatives, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until at least through June 30, 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. We are monitoring the developments regarding the alternative rates, will work with our lenders and counterparties to identify a suitable replacement rate and may amend certain debt and interest rate derivative agreements to accommodate those rates if the contract does not already specify a replacement rate. At this time, we are not able to predict whether SOFR or another index or indices will become a market standard that replaces LIBOR, and if so, the effects on our financial condition.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. For additional detail on our credit ratings, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOwnership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described herein under Risk Factors and the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of capacity change;\n\u2022acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022our growth rate and our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022the financial markets, interest rates and general economic conditions;\n\u2022changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022our competitors or the forest products industry generally;\n\u2022failure to pay cash dividends or the amount of cash dividends paid;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock; and\n\u2022changes in accounting principles and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. Some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAdditionally, shareholder activism regarding our governance, strategic direction and operations could result in negative impacts to our business by adversely affecting our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategies and initiatives. Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors through actions such as strategic initiatives, financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, share repurchases, or sales of assets or the entire company. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, all of which could negatively impact our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals of our business.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and that of our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022stockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent and stockholders cannot call a special meeting except upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;\n\u2022advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022in order to facilitate the preservation of our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, a prohibition on any single stockholder, or any group of affiliated stockholders, from beneficially owning more than 9.8% of our outstanding common or preferred stock, unless our board waives or modifies this ownership limitation;\n\u2022unless approved by the vote of at least 80% of our outstanding shares, we may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u2022supermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.\nREIT and Tax Risks\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, income from our timberlands will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates and we will have reduced cash available for dividends to our stockholders.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations, including satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, dividend, stockholder ownership and other requirements, on an ongoing basis. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a REIT.\nIf in any taxable year we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code:\n\u2022we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n\u2022we would be subject to a federal income tax on our REIT taxable income at regular corporate rates; and\n\u2022we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for dividends to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. As a result, net income and the cash available for dividends to our stockholders could be reduced for at least five years.\nTo maintain our REIT qualification, we are generally required to distribute all our REIT taxable income to our shareholders.\nUnder the REIT rules, to remain qualified as a REIT, a REIT must distribute, within a certain period after the end of each year, 90% of its ordinary taxable income for such year. Our REIT income, however, consists primarily of net capital gains resulting from payments received under timber cutting contracts with our TRS and third parties, rather than ordinary taxable income. Therefore, unlike most REITs, we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash to remain qualified as a REIT. If, after giving effect to our dividends, we have not distributed an amount equal to 100% of our REIT taxable income, then we would be required to pay tax on the undistributed portion of such taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and our stockholders would be required to include their proportionate share of any undistributed capital gain in income and would receive a credit or refund for their share of the tax paid by us.\nTo our knowledge, no REIT has utilized the capital gains exception and we believe it is impractical to do so due to tight reporting deadlines, among other challenges. As a result, our ability to retain REIT cash for use in the business is generally limited by the required distribution rules and our practice of distributing the REIT\u2019s taxable income to shareholders.\nCertain of our business activities are potentially subject to a prohibited transactions tax on 100% of our net income derived from such activities, which would reduce our cash flow and impair our ability to pay dividends.\nREITs are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, which for us generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio, growing timber and selling standing timber.\nAccordingly, the manufacture and sale of wood products, certain types of timberland sales, sale of developed real estate and the harvest and sale of logs are conducted through our TRS because such activities generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d if such activities were engaged in directly by the REIT. In general, prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\nBy conducting our business in this manner, we believe we will satisfy the REIT requirements and thus avoid the 100% tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. We may not always be successful, however, in limiting such activities to our TRS. Therefore, we could be subject to the 100% prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur, which would adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to pay quarterly dividends.\nOur ability to pay dividends and service our indebtedness using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiary may be limited.\nReturning cash to shareholders through a secure, regular dividend and opportunistic share repurchases is an important and durable part of our capital allocation strategy. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the actual amount of dividends to be made to stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions in our industry and in the markets for our products, REIT requirements, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions, timber prices, harvest levels on our timberlands, market demand for timberlands, including timberland properties we have identified as potentially having a higher and better use and future acquisitions and dispositions. For a description of debt covenants that could limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders in the future, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Consequently, the level of future dividends to our stockholders may fluctuate and any reduction in the dividend rate may adversely affect our stock price.\nFurther, the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT limit the amount of dividends our REIT can receive from our TRS. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income. No more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividends from our TRS and other non-qualifying types of income. This requirement may limit our ability to receive dividends from our TRS and may impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and service the REIT's indebtedness using cash from PotlatchDeltic TRS.\nTo maintain our REIT qualification, we are required to limit the size of our taxable REIT subsidiary.\nOur TRS enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities, such as our wood products manufacturing operations and certain real estate investments. However, no more than 20% of the value of our REIT gross assets may be represented by securities of our TRS under the REIT rules. We must comply with the 20% limit on a quarterly basis. We believe our TRS\u2019s securities comprise a higher percentage of our REIT\u2019s gross assets than most other REITs which may limit our ability to grow our TRS.\nOur high degree of leverage to volatile lumber prices, coupled with limits on the amount of dividends our REIT can receive from our TRS, also means our TRS can accumulate significant amounts of cash. Cash accumulated and retained by our TRS increases the value of our TRS\u2019s securities and IRS rules may limit our ability to sufficiently rebalance the TRS's assets. The limitations on our ability to reduce the value of our TRS means we have a higher risk than other REITs that we will not comply with the 20% TRS limit and fail to retain our REIT qualification in the future.\nFurthermore, our use of the TRS may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries at all, or as extensively as we use them.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records. Some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store small amounts of sensitive data, including personally identifiable information. We also use information technology for electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers, to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements.\nWe devote significant resources to protecting and improving the security of our systems, and have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans. We require all employees with company email accounts to complete annual cybersecurity training to learn how to spot and report potential threats, and use continuous internal phishing campaigns to test employees\u2019 cyber knowledge and provide supplemental training when necessary. In addition, we maintain cyber liability insurance. However, this insurance may be subject to certain exceptions and may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nAttempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Our information technology systems and those of our third-party providers are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues. Such incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental disclosure of material confidential information or regulated individual personal data, may negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers, operate our business and fulfill our financial reporting obligations, lead to lost revenues and/or increased costs, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Although we have in the past experienced, and may in the future face, cyber-attacks, other cyber incidents or security breaches, we have not experienced a significant cyber event to date. There can be no assurance that our efforts, or efforts of our third-party service providers, will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. Additionally, we may have limited remedies against third-party service providers in the event of service disruptions.\nWe may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.\nOur real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional strategic timberlands and other forest products asset acquisitions in the future. The markets for timberland and forest products assets are highly competitive. We intend to finance acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings, proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof. In addition, it is uncertain whether any acquisitions we make will perform in accordance with our expectations. The failure to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable properties could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded.\nWe have a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering certain of our current and former employees which, at December 31, 2021 was 95.4% funded. Future actions involving our qualified and unqualified defined benefit and other postretirement plans, such as annuity buyouts and lump-sum payouts could cause us to incur significant pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment charges and may require cash contributions to maintain a legally required funded status.\nThe measurement of the pension benefit obligation, determination of pension plan net periodic costs and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate applied to pension plan obligation as changes in long-term interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Changes in assumptions regarding discount rates could also increase future pension costs. Changes in any of these factors may significantly impact future contribution requirements. For additional information regarding this matter, see Note 15: Savings Plans, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results.\nCertain employees at one of our sawmills, representing 14% of our total workforce, are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires in 2023. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on us.", "PERMNO": 49744, "SIC": 2421, "TIC": "PCH"}
