{"cik": "20212", "company": "Churchill Downs Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nEconomic and External Risks\nThe current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results. Other major public health issues could adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results in the future\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the continued effects of the COVID-19 virus, including the emergence of variant strains, and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international, national and local levels. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economies and continued impact on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by national, state, and local authorities in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks. The introduction of vaccine and facemask mandates in certain locations may further impact the number of customers visiting our properties. During the course of the pandemic, we experienced temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments. Although all of our properties are now open to customers, certain locations continue to operate with certain restrictions and limitations on amenities, and the continued impact of the pandemic could result in further suspension of operations.\nThe Company continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, public health threats, civil unrest, and inclement weather, including as a result of climate change\nOur operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance or expose us to substantial liability. Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, civil unrest or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions, safety and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and at our other locations. A major epidemic or pandemic, outbreak of a contagious equine disease, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in the temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments. While we are constantly evaluating our security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities.\nSince horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends. Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events. Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties. The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at our locations, particularly at Churchill Downs Racetrack and Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations\nEconomic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, including:\n\u2022Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers\u2019 disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\u2022Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.\n\u2022Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets. For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.\nLower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.\nOur access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends. Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain. Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.\nWe are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and fees\nWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering and casino industries. Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions. It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nStrategic Risks\nA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customers\nHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations. To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated. A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nActs of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. Our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them. We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOther factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.\nAn inability to attract and retain key and highly-qualified and skilled personnel, as well as disruptions in the general labor market, could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business\nWe believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly-qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization. If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted.\nCompetition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.\nCertain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impact our operations.\nWe have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. Increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of our workers, or labor shortages in our supply chain could result in increased costs and impact our ability to fully staff our operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur Company faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increase\nWe face an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants operating from physical locations and/or through online or mobile platforms, including destination casinos, riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; iGaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stop establishments in certain states, such as Louisiana and Pennsylvania; historical horse racing in Kentucky; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; fantasy sports; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker, sports betting and other varieties of iGaming in a number of states. Expansion of land-based and iGaming in other jurisdictions (both regulated and unregulated) could further compete with our traditional and iGaming operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. Established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states that we operate in or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.\nOur operations also face competition from other leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel.\nOur Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships\nOur Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races. If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Live and Historical Racing segment. In addition, accidents and adverse events that may occur at our race track and any reputational damage as a result may negatively impact attendance at our live horse races. If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the Kentucky Derby. Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and compete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances and other third-party agreements\nWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances with third-parties.\nOur equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives. The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project. Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance their operations. Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.\nWith any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners\u2019 economic, business or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative. We are also\nsubject to risks relating to our co-investors\u2019 failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfaction\nOur TwinSpires and Gaming segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products. Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network. It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources. Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features. While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner. Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine and HRM manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us\nA significant amount of our revenue is attributable to slot, HRM, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our properties, and there are a limited number of slot machine and HRM manufacturers servicing the industry. It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests. A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector. Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted. For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the \"Horsemen\u2019s Groups\"). These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen\u2019s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races. We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen\u2019s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis. The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen\u2019s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-parties\u2019 races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting.\nFrom time to time, certain Horsemen\u2019s Groups have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks. Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen\u2019s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also have written agreements with certain Horsemen\u2019s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in certain states that may be required to operate such gaming.\nWe have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks\u2019 signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks\u2019 facilities, OTBs, and ADWs. From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks\u2019 racing content for wagering at our racetracks. The\ninability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to focus on market access and our retail operations for our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investment\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting. As a result, several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future. The market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors. The success of our retail and online sportsbook and online casino operations are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the timing of adoption of regulations authorizing betting and gaming activities,\n\u2022operating requirements and other restrictions,\n\u2022the number of allowable industry participants,\n\u2022the license fees and tax rates,\n\u2022our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market,\n\u2022the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate,\n\u2022our ability to compete with new entrants in the market,\n\u2022changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, and\n\u2022the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment.\nThere can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from our current and anticipated retail and online sports betting and online casino operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches. Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers\u2019 personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our business\nWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve. Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California\u2019s Information Practices Act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \"CCPA\"), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation. The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business\u2019s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation.\nOur systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer\u2019s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand. These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos. Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.\nThird-parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association\u2019s contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and\npenalties. If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks. Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice. This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nOur operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operations\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business. A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers\u2019 information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.\nOur online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware. We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage. Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.\nWe may not be able to identify and / or complete acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues or the expansion of existing facilities on time, on budget or as planned\nWe pursue acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues and expansion of existing facilities to grow our business.\nWe face challenges in identifying and completing acquisitions or divestiture opportunities or other development or expansion projects that fit with our strategic objectives. These projects require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt. These projects also have risks associated with managing and integrating the acquisition or expansion project.\nWe signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment LLC (\"P2E\") for total consideration of $2.485 billion. Important factors for the proposed P2E transaction include the receipt of regulatory approvals on terms desired or anticipated, unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the proposed transaction, including, without limitation, difficulties that result in the failure to realize expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings from the proposed transaction within the expected time period (if at all), our ability to obtain financing on the anticipated terms and schedule, disruptions of our or P2E\u2019s current plans, operations and relationships with customers and suppliers caused by the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, and our and P2E\u2019s ability to consummate a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to the Hard Rock Sioux City on terms desired or anticipated.\nSupply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure related to these projects could lead to delays and higher project costs. The acquisition or divestiture of businesses may be delayed by external factors beyond our control including federal, state, and local issues.\nThe impact of these risks may cause us to realize the intended benefits of these capital investments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operations\nWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future. The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns. We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all. Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources. The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results. These costs could include the following:\n\u2022restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions,\n\u2022non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities, and\n\u2022costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.\nWe perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate these businesses successfully and integrate them into our existing operations. In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:\n\u2022the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth,\n\u2022the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition,\n\u2022the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products,\n\u2022the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers,\n\u2022costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy,\n\u2022the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience,\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees or customers,\n\u2022the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit employees with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses, and\n\u2022changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.\nIf we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertainties\nWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise. For example, in July 2021, we announced three major multi-year capital investments to transform key areas of Churchill Downs Racetrack: the Homestretch Club, the Turn 1 Experience, and the Paddock and Under the Spires projects. Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we may not receive the intended benefits of such capital investments.\nOwnership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities\nWe own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations. All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants. Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property. Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination. Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions. Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).\nHorse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigation\nPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to negative publicity and / or litigation. Negative publicity may lead some customers to avoid the Company\u2019s properties or could cause horse owners to avoid racing their horses at our racetracks. Any litigation resulting from injuries at our properties could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. We buy insurance for all of our racetracks; however, our coverage may not be sufficient for all losses. Due to the potential impact of negative publicity and inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on us\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.\nAny determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customers\nWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (\"EFT\") and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks. Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibility\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions. A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. We may experience additional union activity in the future. Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions\nFrom time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.\nWe have also been subject to claims in cases concerning or similar to class action allegations. Plaintiffs in such lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the potential losses we may incur. In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the potential losses we will incur and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nOur operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nWe conduct live and historical pari-mutuel wagering, online pari-mutuel wagering through ADWs, casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting operations, which are subject to extensive state and for some local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct our operations or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in the Company. Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, such as hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of machines. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets, the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing governmental licenses, registrations, permits or approvals necessary to operate our existing businesses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.\nOur Live and Historical Racing segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities. We have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for operation. However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses. The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operation. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.\nRegulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations.\nTwinSpires accepts ADWs from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents. The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW pari-mutuel wagering vary from state to state. State attorney generals, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal laws, constitutional principles, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.\nStates may take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful. We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW. Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.\nMany states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering. Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies. The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business\nOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:\n\u2022incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares,\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments,\n\u2022make certain investments,\n\u2022sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets,\n\u2022create liens on certain assets,\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates, and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nAny failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business\nUnder our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us,\n\u2022could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit, or\n\u2022could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities. If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.\nDisruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets, interest rate increases, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or changes to our credit\nratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital.\nOur insurance costs may increase, we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future, and the extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events, all could adversely affect our business\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial. Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements.\nPortions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure. After carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.\nFlooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits. We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters. If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe have \"all risk\" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism). Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations.", "PERMNO": 79026, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CHDN"}
