{"cik": "811808", "company": "SUMMIT FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe, like other financial holding companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (i) credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan clients or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (ii) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, equity prices and credit spreads, (iii) liquidity risk, which is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength and events unrelated to the Company such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues and (iv) operational risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters and security risks.\nIn addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact our business, future results of operations and future cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Given the ongoing and changing nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and credit ratings, is highly uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic, the scale of distribution and public acceptance of any vaccines for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of such vaccines in stemming or stopping the spread of COVID-19. The adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur business is concentrated in West Virginia, the Northern, Shenandoah Valley and Southwestern regions of Virginia and the central region of Kentucky. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes if there are changes in the economic conditions in these areas. A prolonged period of economic recession or other adverse economic conditions in these areas could have a negative impact on Summit. A significant decline in general economic conditions nationally, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, pandemic disease, unemployment, changes in securities markets, declines in the housing market, climate change, a tightening credit environment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, or other institutional firms. Defaults by financial services institutions and even rumors or questions about a financial institution or the financial services industry in general, have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other institutions. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporary impairments could have a materially adverse effect on future earnings and regulatory capital.\nVolatility in the fair value for certain investment securities, whether caused by changes in market conditions, interest rates, credit risk of the issuer, the expected yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant\nfluctuations in the value of the securities as well as any regulatory rulemaking which could exclude or limit the holdings of certain investment securities. This could have a material adverse impact on our accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders\u2019 equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future downgrades, defaults or prepayments, including the liquidation of the underlying collateral in certain securities, could result in future classifications as other-than-temporarily impaired. This could have a material impact on our future earnings, although the impact on shareholders\u2019 equity will be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive income for securities that were temporarily impaired.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nThe Company and Summit Community are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and customers, the Federal Deposit Insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1. Business on page 1.\nWe may become subject to additional regulatory restrictions in the event that our regulatory capital levels decline.\nAlthough the Bank is qualified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action as of December 31, 2021, there is no guarantee that we will not have a decline in our capital category in the future. In the event of such a capital category decline, we would be subject to increased regulatory restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nIf a bank is classified as undercapitalized, the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the FDIC. Pursuant to FDICIA, an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets, engaging in a new line of business, acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution, or opening or acquiring a new branch office, except under certain circumstances, including the acceptance by the FDIC of a capital restoration plan for the bank. Furthermore, if a state non-member bank is classified as undercapitalized, the FDIC may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank; if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, the FDIC would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions. These actions would include, among other things, requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital; improvements in management; limits on interest rates paid; prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers. If a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized, FDICIA requires the bank to be placed into conservatorship or receivership within ninety (90) days, unless the Federal Reserve determines that other action would better achieve the purposes of FDICIA regarding prompt corrective action with respect to undercapitalized banks.\nUnder FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. \u201cWell capitalized\u201d banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but all banks that are not well capitalized could be restricted from accepting such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. These restrictions could materially and adversely affect our ability to access lower costs funds and thereby decrease our future earnings capacity.\nOur financial flexibility could be severely constrained if we are unable to renew our wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available in the future at acceptable rates of interest. We may not have sufficient liquidity to continue to fund new loan\noriginations and we may need to liquidate loans or other assets unexpectedly in order to repay obligations as they mature. Our inability to obtain regulatory consent to accept or renew brokered deposits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects and our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinally, the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank, the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank and the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects. Under FDICIA, the FDIC is required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every bank at least once every twelve (12) months.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for credit losses may be inadequate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nOur loan portfolio subjects us to credit risk. Inherent risks in lending also include fluctuations in collateral values and economic downturns. Making loans is an essential element of our business and there is a risk that our loans will not be repaid.\nWe attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses to provide for our estimate of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As of December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses on loans totaled $32.3 million, which represents approximately 1.17% of our total loans. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates related to current and expected future credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers and securities issuers; new information regarding existing loans, credit commitments and securities holdings; the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global pandemics; natural disasters and risks related to climate change; and identification of additional problem loans, ratings down-grades and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowances for credit losses on loans, securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures. There is no precise method of predicting credit losses and therefore, we always face the risk that losses in future periods will exceed our allowance for credit losses and that we would need to make additional provisions to our allowance for credit losses. Our methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is set forth in Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe FDIC and the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions review our allowance for credit and lease losses and may require us to establish additional allowances. Additions to the allowance for credit and lease losses will result in a decrease in our net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow our assets.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on funding sources to meet our liquidity needs, such as brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings, which are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and can be adversely affected by general economic conditions.\nWe have frequently utilized, as a source of funds, certificates of deposit obtained through third parties that solicit funds from their customers for deposit with us, or brokered deposits. Brokered deposits, when compared to retail deposits attracted through a branch network, are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets and could reduce our net interest spread and net interest margin. In addition, brokered deposit funding sources may be more sensitive to significant changes in our financial condition. As of December 31, 2021, brokered deposits totaled $14.7 million, or approximately 0.5% of our total deposits, compared to brokered deposits in the amount of $55.5 million or approximately 2.1% of our total deposits at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $11.3 million in brokered deposits, or approximately 77.2% of our total brokered deposits, mature within one year. Our ability to continue to acquire brokered deposits is subject to our ability to price these deposits at competitive levels, which may increase our funding costs and the confidence of the market. In addition, if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current regulatory guidelines, we could be restricted from using brokered deposits as a funding source.\nWe also have borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, or the FHLB. As of December 31, 2021, our FHLB borrowings maturing within one year totaled $140.0 million. If we were unable to borrow from the FHLB in the future, we may be required to seek higher cost funding sources, which could materially and adversely affect our net interest income.\nOne aspect of our liquidity management process is establishing contingent liquidity funding plans under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages or events. Page 46 of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations shows three \u201cstressed\u201d liquidity circumstances and our related contingency plans with respect to each.\nWe pursue a strategy of supplementing internal growth by acquiring other financial companies or their assets and liabilities that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy.\nAs part of our general growth strategy, we have partially expanded our business through acquisitions. We completed the acquisition of WinFirst Financial Corp. (\"WinFirst\") on December 14, 2020, Cornerstone Financial Services, Inc. (\"Cornerstone\") on January 1, 2020, the Peoples Bankshares, Inc. (\"Peoples\") acquisition on January 1, 2019, the First Century Bankshares, Inc. (\"FCB\") acquisition in April 2017 and the acquisition of Highland County Bankshares, Inc. (\"HCB\") in October 2016. We also acquired four branches in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia from MVB Bank, Inc. on April 24, 2020 and four branches and two drive-up banking locations of MVB Bank, Inc., in southern West Virginia on July 12, 2021. Although our business strategy emphasizes organic expansion, we continue, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, to engage in preliminary discussions with potential acquisition targets. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets. The consummation of any future acquisitions may dilute shareholder value or may have an adverse effect upon our operating results while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated into our operations. In addition, once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of profitability comparable to those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. Further, transaction-related expenses may adversely affect our earnings. These adverse effects on our earnings and results of operations may have a negative impact on the value of our common stock. Acquiring banks, bank branches or other businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022We may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets, and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected;\n\u2022Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future;\n\u2022The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u2022To the extent our costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired, the acquisition will generate goodwill. As discussed below, we are required to assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually, and any goodwill impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; and\n\u2022To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issue additional shares, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nAcquisitions may be delayed, impeded, or prohibited due to regulatory issues.\nAcquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies (collectively, \u201cregulatory approvals\u201d). The process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult since the global financial crisis, and our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions depends on the bank regulators' views at the time as to our capital levels, quality of management, and overall condition, in addition to their assessment of a variety of other factors, including our compliance with law. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded,\nrestrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to Bank Secrecy Act compliance, Community Reinvestment Act issues, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices regulations and other laws and regulations. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on those properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our credit exposures are concentrated in industries that may be more susceptible to the long-term risks of climate change, natural disasters or global pandemics. To the extent that these risks may have a negative impact on the financial condition of borrowers, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our future earnings.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce income and cash flow. Our income and cash flow depend primarily on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rates are beyond our control and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence loan originations, purchases of investments, volumes of deposits and rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates or by the shape of the yield curve.\nUncertainty relating to LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Subsequently, the FRB announced final plans for the production of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which resulted in the commencement of its published rates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on April 3, 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain.\nThe administrator for LIBOR announced on March 5, 2021 that it will permanently cease to publish most LIBOR settings beginning on January 1, 2022 and cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, the FCA has stated that is does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after such respective dates. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR.\nBanking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. We have not yet determined which alternative rate is most applicable, and there can be no assurances on which benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR or how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of financial instruments that are currently referencing LIBOR when it ceases to exist. The discontinuance of LIBOR may result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing documents, may adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates and may also increase operational and other risks to the Company and the industry.\nIn addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.\nThe repeal of Federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense as interest rates rise.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. We do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer as market interest rates begin to increase. Our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We believe we have controls in place to detect and prevent such losses but in some cases multi-party collusion or other sophisticated methods of hiding fraud, may not be readily detected or detectable, and could result in losses that affect our financial condition and results of our operations.\nFinancial crime is not limited to the financial services industry. Our customers could experience fraud in their businesses, which could materially impact their ability to repay their loans, and deposit customers in all financial institutions are constantly and unwittingly solicited by others in fraud schemes that vary from easily detectable and obvious attempts to high-level and very complex international schemes that could drain an account of a significant amount and require detailed financial forensics to unravel. While we have controls in place, contractual agreements with our customers partitioning liability, and insurance to help mitigate the risk, none of these are guarantees that we will not experience a loss, potentially a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of our operations.\nOur information systems may experience failure, interruption or breach in security.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to our operations. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. Our technologies, systems, networks and software and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us. Our collection of such customer and company data is subject to extensive regulation and oversight.\nOur customers and employees have been and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \"Trojan horse\" programs to our information systems and/or our customers' computers. Though we endeavor to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education, such cyber attacks against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue. The pervasiveness of cybersecurity incidents in general and the risks of cyber crime are complex and continue to evolve. More generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. While we maintain specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. A security breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our customers, merchants and our third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the us to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for certain information system, data management and processing services and to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe outsource certain information system and data management and processing functions to third party providers. These third party service providers are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If third party service providers encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our business.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions.\nThese services must be available on a continuous and timely basis and be in compliance with any regulatory requirements. Failure to do so could substantially harm our business.\nWe often purchase services from vendors under agreements that typically can be terminated on a periodic basis. There can be no assurance, however, that vendors will be able to meet their obligations under these agreements or that we will be able to compel them to do so. Risks of relying on vendors include the following:\n\u2022If an existing agreement expires or a certain service is discontinued by a vendor, then we may not be able to continue to offer our customers the same breadth of products and our operating results would likely suffer unless we are able to find an alternate supply of a similar service.\n\u2022Agreements we may negotiate in the future may commit us to certain minimum spending obligations. It is possible that we will not be able to create the market demand to meet such obligations.\n\u2022If market demand for our products increases suddenly, our current vendors might not be able to fulfill our commercial needs, which would require us to seek new arrangements or new sources of supply and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand.\n\u2022We may not be able to control or adequately monitor the quality of services we receive from our vendors. Poor quality services could damage our reputation with our customers.\nPotential problems with vendors such as those discussed above could have a significant adverse effect on our business, lead to higher costs and damage our reputation with our customers and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on technology and our inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiary bank, Summit Community. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Summit Community may pay to Summit. Also, Summit\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event Summit Community is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from Summit Community could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, general market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, or changes in government regulations.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nOur executive officers and directors own shares of our common stock, allowing management to have an impact on our corporate affairs.\nAs of March 1, 2022, our executive officers and directors beneficially own 13.5% (computed in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13d-3) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these executive officers and directors will be able to impact the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to our shareholders for approval, including decisions relating to the election of directors, the determination of our day-to-day corporate and management policies and other significant corporate transactions.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional classes or series of preferred shares without any action on the part of the shareholders. The board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred shares that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of\nthe common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nWe have three statutory business trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable securities (the \u201ccapital securities\u201d) for which we are obligated to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities in our junior subordinated debentures (the \u201cdebentures\u201d). The debentures held by the trusts are their sole assets. Our subordinated debentures of these unconsolidated statutory trusts totaled approximately $19.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDistributions on the capital securities issued by the trusts are payable quarterly, at the variable interest rates specified in those certain securities. The capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the debentures.\nPayments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of the statutory trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five (5) years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock.\nThe capital securities held by our three trust subsidiaries qualify as Tier 1 capital under FRB guidelines. In accordance with these guidelines, trust preferred securities generally are limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of Tier 1 capital elements, net of goodwill. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit can be included in Tier 2 capital.\nOn September 22, 2020, we issued and sold $30 million in the aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the \u201csubordinated notes\u201d) in a private placement. The subordinated notes mature on September 30, 2030 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per year, from and including September 22, 2020 to, but excluding, September 30, 2025, payable quarterly in arrears. From and including September 30, 2025 to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly at a variable rate equal to the then current three-month term SOFR, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 487 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. As provided in the subordinated notes, the interest rate on the Notes during the applicable floating rate period may be determined based on a rate other than three-month term SOFR.\nPrior to the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, we may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole but not in part, only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the subordinated notes. On or after the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, we may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, at our option, on any interest payment date.\nPrincipal and interest on the subordinated notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances in the case of certain bankruptcy and insolvency-related events with respect to Summit Financial Group. The subordinated notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of Summit Financial Group, are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any subsidiary of Summit Financial Group, and rank junior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s current and future senior indebtedness. The Notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes.\nOn November 16, 2021, we issued and sold $75 million in the aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes (the \u201csubordinated notes\u201d) in a private placement. The subordinated notes mature on December 1, 2031 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per year, from and including November 16, 2021 to, but excluding, December 1, 2026, payable quarterly in arrears. From and including December 1, 2026 to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption date, the subordinated notes will bear an interest at an annual floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to the benchmark rate (which is expected to be the then-current Three-Month Term SOFR), plus 230 basis points, or such other rate as determined pursuant to the indenture, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year through December 1, 2031 or earlier redemption date.\nPrior to the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, we may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole but not in part, only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the subordinated notes. On or after the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, we may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, at our option, on any interest payment date.\nPrincipal and interest on the subordinated notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances in the case of certain bankruptcy and insolvency-related events with respect to Summit Financial Group. The subordinated notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of Summit Financial Group, are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any subsidiary of Summit Financial Group, and rank junior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s current and future senior indebtedness. The Notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes.\nThe debentures and subordinated notes are senior to our shares of capital stock. As a result, we must make payments on the debentures and the subordinated notes before any dividends can be paid on our stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures and the subordinated notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our stock.\nIn 2021, our total interest payments on the debentures approximated $504,000 and the total interest paid on the subordinated notes was $1.5 million. Based on current rates, our quarterly interest payment obligation on the debentures is approximately $123,000 and on the 2020 subordinated notes is approximately $375,000 and the semi-annual interest payment obligation on the 2021 subordinated notes is approximately $1.2 million.\nProvisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or could otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. For example, our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors. We also have a staggered board of directors, which means that only one-third (1/3) of our Board of Directors can be replaced by shareholders at any annual meeting.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are subject to a decline, perhaps even significantly, for several reasons including if there is a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, change in the business environment, or a material and sustained decline in the market value of our stock, which may require us to take future charges related to the impairment of that goodwill and other intangible assets in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe operate in a very competitive industry and market.\nWe face aggressive competition not only from banks, but also from other financial services companies, including finance companies and credit unions and, to a limited degree, from other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms and consumer finance companies. A number of competitors in our market areas are larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems and offer a wider array of banking services. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. Our profitability depends upon our ability to attract loans and deposits. There is a risk that aggressive competition could result in our controlling a smaller share of our markets. A decline in market share could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of key officers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nOur success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by our ability to retain the services of existing senior management and, as we expand, to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management. Our senior executive officers have been instrumental in the development and management of our business. The loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nThe negative economic effects caused by inflation, terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, potential attacks and other destabilizing events, would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and could reduce our customer base, level of deposits and demand for our financial products, such as loans.\nHigh inflation, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, including cyber attacks, an escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences and other factors could have a negative impact on the economy of the Mid-Atlantic regions in which we operate. An additional economic downturn in our markets would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio by impacting the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and may reduce the level of deposits in our bank and the stability of our deposit funding sources. An additional economic downturn could also have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services. The cumulative effect of these matters on our results of operations and financial condition could be adverse and material.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe accounting standard setting bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards affecting the preparation of financial statements. These changes are not within our control and could materially impact our financial statements.\nOur potential inability to integrate companies we may acquire in the future could have a negative effect on our expenses and results of operations.\nOn occasion, we may engage in a strategic acquisition when we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand our business. To fully benefit from such acquisition, however, we must integrate the administrative, financial, sales, lending, collections and marketing functions of the acquired company. If we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition and our financial results may be negatively affected. A completed acquisition may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including our capital requirements and the accounting treatment of the acquisition. Completed acquisitions may also lead to significant unexpected liabilities after the consummation of these acquisitions.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect our business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue, and the United States has entered into international agreements in an attempt to reduce global temperatures, such as reentering the Paris Agreement. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate.\nClimate change also exposes us to transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. Transition risks may result from changes in policies; laws and regulations; technologies; and/or market preferences to address climate change. Such changes could materially, negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or our reputation, in addition to having a similar impact on our customers. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.", "PERMNO": 90544, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMMF"}
