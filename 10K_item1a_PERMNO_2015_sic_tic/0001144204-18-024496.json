{"cik": "1383097", "company": "NAKED BRAND GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-05-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our company or future operations.\nWe are still evolving our business plan as a growing company. As a result, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to operate the business successfully. For the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, our net revenues were $2,859,884 and $1,842,065, respectively. Naked commenced operations in 2010 and, since beginning operations, we have generated limited total revenues. As a relatively new company, we are subject to many risks associated with the initial organization, financing, expenditures, and impediments inherent in a new business and there is limited history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful.\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow that may continue into the foreseeable future. If we fail to execute our strategy to achieve and maintain profitability in the future, investors could lose confidence in the value of our common stock, which could cause our stock price to decline and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Investors should evaluate an investment in our company in light of the obstacles that may be encountered by a start-up company in a competitive market.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.\nThe operation of our business and our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays. We are largely dependent on outside capital to implement our business plan and support our operations. We anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our growth efforts, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely, in which case, you may lose all your investment. Financings, including future equity investments, if obtained, may be on terms that are dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price at which you purchase your shares. Furthermore, the terms of securities issued in a financing, if obtained, may be more favorable for new investors.\nInvestors should be aware that the value of an investment in our company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in our company will fully reflect its underlying value.\nOur auditors\u2019 report on our January 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements included an explanatory paragraph regarding there being substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred a net loss of $5,789,805 and $10,798,503, respectively. We anticipate generating losses for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue operations in the future as a going concern, as noted by our auditors with respect to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2018. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in our company.\nWe have a concentration of sales to key customers and any substantial reduction in sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2018, sales were concentrated with Bloomingdales, Nordstrom.com, and Dillard\u2019s, which accounted for 8.9%, 11%, and 8.2%, respectively, of our net sales. During fiscal 2017, Nordstrom accounted for 12.4%, Bloomingdales accounted for 13.7%, and Dillards accounted for 3.3% of our net sales. The decline in percentage of sales to Nordstrom and Bloomingdales during fiscal 2018 is largely due to an increase in sales across all channels leading to a decrease in sales concentrations to key customers. Nordstrom.com, Bloomingdales, and Dillard\u2019s are currently of key importance to our business and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if these relationships ceased. Although we have diversified our customers and continue to receive increasing sales orders from existing customers, these customers do not have any ongoing purchase commitment agreement with us; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the volume of sales will remain consistent going forward. Any substantial change in purchasing decisions by these customers, whether due to actions by our competitors, industry factors or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenue and profitability.\nThe market for innerwear products is highly competitive. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or lost market share or a failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers of innerwear products, including large, diversified companies with substantial market share and strong worldwide brand recognition, such as Calvin Klein, Polo Ralph Lauren, 2(x)ist, Hugo Boss, Tommy John, Saxx Giorgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, DKNY, Natori, Free People, Hanky Panky, Commando, Cosabella, MeUndies, Bread&Boxers, Frigo and others. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors promote their brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have greater and substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we can by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as catalog sales or an extensive franchise network, as opposed to distribution through retail stores, wholesale or internet, and many of our competitors have substantial resources to devote toward increasing sales in such ways.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. We may be unable to introduce new products in a timely manner. Our customers may not accept our new products including our recently launched women\u2019s products, or our competitors may introduce similar products in a more timely fashion. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. Our failure to effectively introduce new products that are accepted by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain our endorsements by professional athletes and celebrities, our ability to market and sell our products may be harmed.\nAn important element of our marketing strategy is to obtain endorsements from prominent athletes and celebrities, which may contribute to the image of our brands. To date, we have entered into one celebrity endorsement agreement with Dwyane Wade, an NBA basketball player of which was terminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 We believe that this strategy will continue be an effective means of gaining brand exposure worldwide and creating broad appeal for our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new athletes and celebrities to endorse our products. We also are subject to risks related to the selection of athletes and celebrities whom we choose to endorse our products. We may select athletes who are unable to perform at expected levels or who are not sufficiently marketable. In addition, negative publicity concerning any of our athletes and celebrities could harm our brand and adversely impact our business. If we are unable in the future to secure prominent athletes and celebrities and arrange endorsements of our products on terms we deem to be reasonable, we may be required to modify our marketing platform and to rely more heavily on other forms of marketing and promotion, which may not prove to be effective. In any event, our inability to obtain endorsements from professional athletes and celebrities could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products, resulting in loss of revenues.\nAn economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nMany of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, particularly those in the United States, and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability of consumer credit, levels of unemployment, tax rates and the cost of consumer credit. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. The current volatility in the United States economy in particular has resulted in an overall slowing in growth in the retail sector because of decreased consumer spending, which may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. These unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchase of our products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets, or may decline, when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North America. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur sales and profitability may decline as a result of increasing product costs and decreasing selling prices.\nOur business is subject to significant pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including intense competition, constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressure, pressure from consumers to reduce the prices we charge for our products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to experience increased costs, reduce our sales prices to consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, operating results and cash flows.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale in our stores or for delivery to customers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could impair the strength and exclusivity of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and customer relationships.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over them and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.\nWe do not manufacture our products or the raw materials for them and rely instead on third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed and manufactured by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a very limited number of sources. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional suppliers of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from other participants in our supply chain. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term. We have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. In that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. If defects in the manufacture of our products are not discovered until after our customers purchase such products, our customers could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products and our results of operations could suffer and our business could be harmed.\nThe fluctuating cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nThe fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers include synthetic fabrics whose raw materials include petroleum-based products. Our products also include natural fibers, including cotton. Our costs for raw materials are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Increases in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur ability to source our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.\nThe United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels. Countries impose, modify and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenue from operations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant seasonal variations in our net revenue from operations. Seasonal variations in our net revenue are primarily related to increased sales of our products during our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, net revenue and profits contributed by new retailers; increases or decreases in comparable sales; changes in our product mix; and the timing of new advertising and new product introductions.\nAs a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nAs a result of growth and changes to our business with the introduction of new product lines during the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years, the natural seasonality of our business has had a reduced effect. However, our operating history and nature as a developing company make it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business or whether or not our business is susceptible to cyclical fluctuations in the economy in the markets in which we operate. Likewise, our growth may have obscured the effect of any seasonal or cyclical factors on our business to date. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our business may become more pronounced over time and may harm our results of operations in the future. Any future seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. Disappointing quarterly results could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Seasonal or quarterly factors in our business and results of operations may also make it more difficult for market analysts and investors to assess the longer-term strength of our business at any particular point, which could lead to increased volatility in our stock price. Increased volatility could cause our stock price to suffer in comparison to less volatile investments.\nIf we are unable to adequately demonstrate that our independent manufacturers use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nOur core values, which include developing the highest quality products while operating with integrity, are an important component of our brand image, which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility, fair wage practices, and compliance with child labor laws, among others, and we, along with a third party that we retain for this purpose, monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, Canada or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our merchandise if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. Other apparel manufacturers have encountered significant problems in this regard, and these problems have resulted in organized boycotts of their products and significant adverse publicity. If we, or other manufacturers in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, stock price and results of operations.\nOur operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends, to an extent, on our international expansion efforts. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any new market. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products by customers in these new international markets. Our failure to develop new international markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets will harm our business and results of operations.\nOur current operations in international markets and our efforts to expand into additional international markets, and any earnings in those markets, may be affected by legal and regulatory risks.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-corruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and manufacture our products. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of the Naked brand. The Naked name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. We rely on social media as one of our marketing strategies to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers or manufacturers could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers or manufacturing sources. Additionally, while we devote considerable efforts and resources to protecting our intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAny material disruption of our information systems could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe rely on information systems to operate our e-commerce website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, system failures, viruses, cyber-attack or other causes, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. If changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or become obsolete, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems, and we could endure delays in our operations.\nIf we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information, including personal information about our customers, and process payment transactions through our information systems. Although we endeavor to protect confidential information and payment information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our customers, employees and other third parties. Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our customers, employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as well as increased costs such as organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach. We are not aware of that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors.\nThe intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is therefore limited and we currently own no patents or exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products. As a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrics and styling similar to our products. Because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe currently rely on trademarks, as well as confidentiality procedures, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States, Canada or the European Union, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished, and our competitive position may suffer.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Creative Officer, Carole Hochman. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to retain existing personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to our customer and employee relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nBecause a portion of our sales may be generated in foreign countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the US dollar. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue in foreign countries, and changes in exchange rates between the currencies for those countries and the US dollar may have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the currencies for those countries. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nWhile we believe we have taken the steps necessary to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we can give no assurance that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future.\nAny material weakness or other deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure obligations or cause our consolidated financial statements to contain material misstatements, which could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Investors relying upon our consolidated financial statements may make a misinformed investment decision.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock and Public Reporting Requirements\nOn February 1, 2018 we received writing notice from Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements due to our failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. Our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we cannot satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nOn February 1, 2018, Naked Brand Group Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying the Company that it no longer complies with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) due to the Company\u2019s failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 (the \u201cAnnual Meeting Requirement\u201d). The Company delayed holding its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders because of the contemplated business combination with Bendon Limited and Bendon Group Holdings Limited that would be submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for a vote at a meeting.\nNasdaq\u2019s notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(G), the Company has 45 calendar days from February 1, 2018 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement. If Nasdaq accepts the Company\u2019s plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the end of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017, or until July 30, 2018, to regain compliance.\nOn March 19, 2018, the Company provided Nasdaq with a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement, which, among other things, explained the reasons for the Company\u2019s delay in holding its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and stated the Company\u2019s intention to hold an annual meeting of stockholders on or before July 30, 2018.\nOn March 27, 2018, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq granting the Company an extension until July 30, 2018 to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement by holding an annual meeting of stockholders at which, among other things, the stockholders shall elect directors to the Board of Directors of the Company. The notice further provides that in the event the Company does not satisfy such terms, Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company\u2019s securities will be delisted.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution in the future.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 18,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 10,342,191 shares are issued and outstanding as of May 1, 2018. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Historically trading in our stock has been thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. Although we believe that the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has improved the liquidity of our common stock, our stock has been historically characterized by large volatility. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling shares of our common stock.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and such other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline and investors in this offering may experience dilution by exercises of outstanding options and warrants.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAs of January 31, 2018, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 3,472,399 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.85 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,212,302 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $5.40 per share. The exercise of such outstanding options and warrants will result in further dilution of your investment. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.\nWe are a former \u201cshell company\u201d and as such are subject to certain limitations not applicable to other public companies generally.\nPrior to our acquisition of Naked Inc. in June 2012, we were a public reporting \u201cshell company,\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Although we are no longer a \u201cshell company,\u201d we are subject to certain restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the resale of securities issued by issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. Specifically, the Rule 144 safe harbor available for the resale of our restricted securities is only available to our stockholders if we have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding twelve months, other than current reports on Form 8-K, at the time of the proposed sale, regardless of whether the restricted securities were initially issued at the time we were a shell company or subsequent to termination of such status. Accordingly, holders of our \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 will be subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 144 with respect to our company. Other reporting companies that are not former shell companies and have been reporting for more than twelve months are not subject to this same reporting threshold for non-affiliate reliance on Rule 144.\nAccordingly, any restricted securities we have sold or sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, may not be resold unless such securities are registered with the SEC or the requirements of Rule 144 have been satisfied. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our employees and consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it may be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our prior status as a \u201cshell company\u201d could prevent us in the future from raising additional funds, engaging employees and consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions, which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.\nFurther, as current and former shell companies and reverse acquisition transactions have been, and remain to some degree, subject to additional scrutiny by the SEC, FINRA and the national securities exchanges, our prior shell company status and the reverse acquisition transaction that terminated it may result in delays in the completion of any offering and our attempt to qualify for and list on a national securities exchange. Specifically, as a former shell company and subject of a reverse acquisition transaction, we may need to demonstrate the ability to maintain a threshold per share market price for an extended trading period in order to qualify for listing on a national securities exchange.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.\nThe operation of our business and our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays. We are largely dependent on outside capital to implement our business plan and support our operations. We anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our growth efforts, which could harm our business plans, financial condition, and operating results, or cease our operations entirely, in which case, you may lose all your investment. Financings, including future equity investments, if obtained, may be on terms that are dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price at which you purchase your shares.\nAs of January 31, 2018, the Company had cash totaling $1,414,871. The latest amendment to the Merger Agreement requires Bendon to fund all operating losses until closing. Due to this requirement, we believe we have sufficient working capital to implement our proposed business plan over the next 12 months.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part upon the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger and the Combined Company\nHoldco\u2019s shares may not be listed on a securities exchange. Even if listed, Holdco may be unable to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.\nHoldco has applied for listing, to be effective at the time of the consummation of the Transactions, of the Holdco Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq. However, Holdco will be required to meet the initial listing requirements of such exchange in order to be listed. Holdco may not be able to meet those initial listing requirements. The initial listing requirements for new issuers are stringent and, although Holdco may explore various actions to meet the requirements, there is no guarantee that any such actions will be successful in bringing it into compliance with the requirements. For example, Nasdaq has indicated that it will not approve Holdco's application unless Holdco counteracts the conditions that cast substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. While Holdco has a plan to counteract these conditions, there can be no assurance it will be successful in implementing this plan. For this reason, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will approve Holdco\u2019s application. It is a condition of the consummation of the Transactions that Holdco receive confirmation from Nasdaq or the NYSE that the Holdco Ordinary Shares have been approved for listing. This condition cannot be waived. Accordingly, if Nasdaq does not approve Holdco\u2019s application for listing of the Holdco Ordinary Shares, the Transactions will not be completed.\nEven if the Holdco Ordinary Shares are so listed and the Transactions are completed, Holdco may be unable to meet the continued listing requirements in the future and accordingly may be unable to maintain the listing of its securities.\nIf Holdco meets the initial listing requirements, but is unable to meet the continued listing requirements and the Holdco Ordinary Shares are subsequently delisted, Holdco could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the company; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nHoldCo, the surviving corporation in the Merger, has never previously been a US reporting company.\nHoldCo, which will be the surviving corporation in the Merger, has never previously been a reporting company in the United States subject to U.S. federal and state securities laws, including the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The combined company will be required to increase its compliance efforts and incur significant costs in connection with complying with public company requirements under U.S. federal and state securities laws. The attention of management may be diverted on a frequent basis in order to carry out public company reporting and related obligations, rather than directing their full time and attention to the operation and growth of the business. Employees and some members of the management team have had limited experience working for a US reporting company, increasing the risk of non-compliance. The combined company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud or misconduct by persons inside or outside the combined company. Similarly, if the combined company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the combined company may not be able to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Noncompliance with U.S. federal and state securities laws and other regulatory requirements could result in administrative or other penalties or civil or criminal judgments against the combined company or harm to the combined company\u2019s reputation. These consequences could affect investor confidence in the combined company and cause the price of the stock to decline, result in the delisting of the combined company\u2019s shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market, require the payment of fines or other amounts, distract management\u2019s time and attention to the business or result in the loss of customer or supplier relationships, thus reducing the value of the combined company\u2019s ordinary shares.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement may not be indicative of what the combined company\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement is presented for illustrative purposes only, has been prepared based on a number of assumptions and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the business combination been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that the combined companies may achieve as a result of the business combination or the costs to combine the operations of Naked and Bendon or the costs necessary to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements. Each of Bendon and Naked has an explanatory paragraph regarding there being substantial doubt about each company\u2019s continuing as a going concern.\nHoldco has no operating history. The unaudited pro-forma financial information and the historical combined financial information included in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus in the Registration Statement, may not be representative of actual results as a combined company, and accordingly, you have limited financial information on which to evaluate the combined company and your investment decision.\nBendon and Naked have no prior history as a combined entity and their operations have not previously been managed on a combined basis. As a result, the pro forma financial information for the combined company and the combined audited financial statements of Bendon and Naked giving effect to the Merger included elsewhere in definitive proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement as presented are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations of the combined company that would have actually occurred had the Merger been completed at or as of the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future operating or financial position of the combined company. The pro-forma financial information for the combined company does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies. The pro-forma financial information presented in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement, is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the Merger that Bendon and Naked believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, assumptions used in preparing such financial information may not prove to be accurate over time. Investors should not place any undue reliance on the pro forma financial information of the combined company.\nIf the adjournment proposal is not approved, and an insufficient number of votes have been obtained to approve the consummation of the Transactions, Naked\u2019s board of directors will not have the ability to adjourn the special meeting to a later date in order to solicit further votes, and, therefore, the Transactions will not be approved.\nNaked\u2019s board of directors is seeking approval to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if, based on the tabulated vote, Naked is unable to consummate the Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the adjournment proposal is not approved, Naked\u2019s board will be unable to adjourn the special meeting to a later date and, therefore, will not have more time to solicit votes to approve the consummation of the Transactions. In such event, the Transactions would not be completed.\nBecause the number of Holdco Ordinary Shares that are issuable to the shareholders of Bendon in the Reorganization is adjustable depending on the net debt of Bendon and the net assets of Naked, as finally determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Naked shareholders cannot be certain of the precise percentage ownership of Holdco that they will hold immediately following the closing of the Merger.\nThe number of Holdco Ordinary Shares that are issuable to the shareholders of Bendon in the Reorganization is adjustable depending on the net debt of Bendon and net assets of Naked, as finally determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement. If it is finally determined that Naked\u2019s Net Assets (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at the Closing of the Transactions are less than the Net Asset Amount (as defined in the Merger Agreement) by at least $150,000, then the number of Holdco Ordinary Shares issuable to Bendon will be increased by the number equal to the product obtained by multiplying the difference in the asset amount by 2.327. If, however, the Naked\u2019s Net Assets at the closing of the Transactions are greater than the Net Asset Amount by at least $150,000, then then the number of Holdco Ordinary Shares issuable to Bendon will be reduced by the same ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as Naked does not incur any expenditures that in the aggregate exceed any line item in the Budget (as defined below) by more than 10%, unless otherwise agreed to by the Budget Committee, no adjustment will be made based on Naked's Net Assets. Additionally, if the Bendon\u2019s Net Debt (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at the closing of the Transactions exceeds the Net Debt Amount (as defined in the Merger Agreement) by at least $1,000,000, then then the number of Holdco Ordinary Shares issuable to Bendon will be reduced by the number equal to the product obtained by multiplying the difference in the debt amount by 0.167. If, however, the Bendon\u2019s Net Debt at the closing of the Transactions is less than the Net Debt Amount by at least $1,000,000, then then the number of Holdco Ordinary Shares issuable to Bendon will be increased by the same ratio. Since the Naked Closing Net Assets and Bendon Closing Net Debt will not be determined until the closing of the Merger, Naked stockholders cannot be certain of the exact percentage ownership of Holdco that they will hold immediately following the closing of the Merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger could harm Naked\u2019s future business and operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, Naked is subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u00b7 costs related to the Merger, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed;\n\u00b7 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Naked may be required to issue to Bendon 1,250,000 or 2,500,000 shares of Naked Common Stock (not subject to a registration statement), as adjusted for any stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends or similar transactions affecting Naked Common Stock;\n\u00b7 the attention of management of Naked may have been diverted to the Merger rather than to Naked\u2019s operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to it;\n\u00b7 the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u00b7 the price of Naked stock may decline and remain volatile;\n\u00b7 Naked will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business which may have prevented it from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the Merger was pending; and\n\u00b7 Naked may be subject to litigation related to the Merger or any failure to complete the Merger.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of Holdco determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Naked will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided by Holdco in the Merger.\nBendon and Naked will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger.\nBendon and Naked expect to incur material non-recurring expenses in connection with the Merger and consummation of the Transactions. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of the integration of the businesses of Bendon and Naked. The parties cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term, or at all.\nThe Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and other causes.\nIn general, either Naked or Holdco can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between the signing date of the Merger Agreement, and the planned closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Naked or Holdco, including the following events (except, in some cases, where the change has a disproportionate effect on a party):\n\u00b7 changes generally affecting the economy, financial or securities markets;\n\u00b7 the announcement of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the impact thereof on the relationships of a party with its employees, customers, suppliers, or partners;\n\u00b7 the outbreak or escalation of war or any act of terrorism, civil unrest, or natural disasters;\n\u00b7 changes (including changes in law) or general conditions in the industry in which the party operates;\n\u00b7 changes in GAAP (or the authoritative interpretation of GAAP); or\n\u00b7 compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by the Merger Agreement.\nIf adverse changes occur and Naked and Holdco still complete the Merger, the combined company\u2019s stock price may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the stockholders of Naked.\nThe pendency of the Merger could materially adversely affect our business and operations or result in a loss of its employees, which, consequently, could materially adversely affect the business and operations of the combined company.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business and, consequently, on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees until the completion of the Merger, which may have a material adverse effect on us if the Merger is not completed. If employees depart because of issues concerning employment security and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, HoldCo\u2019s future business could be adversely affected. Similarly, uncertainties about the effect of the Merger could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with us to change their existing business relationships, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. The realization of any of these risks may materially adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nCurrent stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the Merger.\nAs a result of the Merger, Naked stockholders along with Bendon\u2019s affiliates are expected to hold approximately 8.35% of the combined company\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares immediately following completion of the Transactions. Holdco shareholders and our stockholders currently have the right to vote for their respective directors and on other matters affecting the applicable company. When the Merger occurs, each of our stockholders that receives ordinary shares of the combined company will hold a percentage ownership of the combined company that will be significantly smaller than the stockholder\u2019s current percentage ownership of Naked. The combined company will be controlled by Bendon\u2019s affiliates, which are expected to approximately 64.8% of all shares of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. As further discussed below, Bendon and its affiliates will be able to exercise significant influence over the combined company\u2019s business policies and affairs due to its large ownership percentage. As a result of their reduced ownership percentages, our former stockholders will have less voting power in the combined company than they now have with respect to us.\nThe lack of a public market for Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, thus the stockholders of Naked may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of their Naked shares.\nThe ordinary shares of Holdco are not currently listed, and no public market currently exists for the Holdco Ordinary Shares. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Holdco. Because the percentage of Holdco Ordinary Shares to be issued to Naked stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the combined company ordinary shares to be issued in connection with the Merger may be less than expected.\nBendon and its affiliates will exercise significant influence over the combined company, and their interests in the combined company may be different than yours.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, Bendon\u2019s affiliates will beneficially own approximately 64.8% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company calculated on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, Bendon\u2019s affiliates will be able to exercise significant influence over the combined company\u2019s business policies and affairs, including the composition of the combined company\u2019s board of directors and any action requiring the approval of the combined company\u2019s shareholders. The interests of Bendon and its affiliates may conflict with your interests. For example, these shareholders may support certain long-term strategies or objectives for the combined company which may not be accretive to shareholders in the short term. The concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of the combined company, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders, and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these parties. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for the combined company\u2019s ordinary shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with shareholders who own significant percentages of a company\u2019s outstanding stock.\nThe combined company may not experience the anticipated strategic benefits of the Merger.\nThe respective management of Naked and Bendon believe that the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits that may not be realized by each of the companies operating as standalones. Specifically, we believe the Merger would provide certain strategic benefits which would enable each of Naked and Bendon to accelerate their respective business plans through an increased access to capital in the public equity markets, increased management strength and management expertise, access to a larger customer base for the combined sales organization. There can be no assurance that these anticipated benefits of the Merger will materialize or that if they materialize will result in increased shareholder value or revenue stream to the combined company.\nSome of the Bendon and Naked officers and directors have interests in the Merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers of Bendon and Naked participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the Merger that are different from yours, including, among others, continued service as an executive officer or director of the combined company and the right to continued indemnification for directors, executive officers and former directors and executive officers of Bendon and Naked following the completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement limits Naked\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, which could discourage a potential acquirer of Naked from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Naked to issue to Bendon a substantial number of shares of Naked Common Stock.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Naked is restricted, subject to limited exceptions, from pursuing or entering into alternative transactions in lieu of the Merger. In general, unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, Naked is restricted from, among other things, soliciting, initiating or knowingly taking any action to facilitate or encourage a competing acquisition proposal. The board of directors of Naked is limited in its ability to change its recommendation with respect to the Merger. Naked may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior offer only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including (i) compliance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the expiration of certain waiting periods during which Holdco may propose changes to the Merger Agreement so the superior offer is no longer a superior offer and (iii) the issuance to Bendon of 1,250,000 shares of Naked Common Stock (not subject to a registration statement), as adjusted for any stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends or similar transactions affecting Naked Common Stock.\nThe fairness opinion rendered to the board of directors of Naked by Noble Capital Markets will not reflect changes in circumstances, including general market and economic conditions or the prospects of Naked or Holdco, between the signing the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger.\nNoble has issued to the Naked board of directors a written opinion, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein, as of the date of execution of the Merger Agreement, the consideration to be received by the stockholders of Naked is fair to the stockholders of Naked from a financial point of view. Naked\u2019s board of directors has not obtained an updated fairness opinion as of the date of this Form 10-K. Importantly, the Noble opinion does not reflect changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date of the opinion, including changes in the operations, performance and prospects of Naked or Holdco, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Naked or Holdco, and on which the fairness opinion was based, that may alter the value of Naked, Bendon or Holdco or the prices of shares of Naked common stock or Holdco Ordinary Shares by the time the Merger is completed. The Noble opinion does not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of execution of the Merger Agreement. Because Naked does not anticipate asking Noble to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the terms the Merger consideration, from a financial point of view, at the time the Merger is completed.\nLitigation may be instituted against us, members of our board of directors, Bendon and members of the Bendon board of directors challenging the Merger, and adverse judgments in these lawsuits may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.\nWe, members of our board of directors, Bendon and members of the Bendon board of directors may be named as defendants in class action lawsuits or other proceedings that may be brought by our stockholders challenging the Merger. If the plaintiffs in any actions that may be brought are successful, these adverse judgments may prevent the parties from completing the Merger in the expected timeframe, if at all. Even if the plaintiffs in these potential actions are not successful, the costs of defending against such claims could adversely affect our financial condition or that of Bendon and such actions could adversely affect the reputations of the parties and members of their respective boards of directors or management.\nWe will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect the financial results of Naked, Holdco and/or the combined company.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management\u2019s attention away from its ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could affect our financial results.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us, without the consent of Holdco, from making certain acquisitions and dispositions and taking other specified actions while the Merger is pending. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our rbusiness prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Holdco Ordinary Shares to be received by Naked stockholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the shares of Naked common stock.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Naked stockholders will become shareholders of the combined company and their rights as shareholders will be governed by Holdco\u2019s certificate of registration and constitution. The combined company will be an Australian company and certain of the rights associated with the combined company ordinary shares will be different from the rights associated with Naked common stock.\nThe lack of a public market for Holdco\u2019s shares makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, thus our stockholders may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of their Naked shares.\nThe outstanding ordinary shares of Holdco are privately held and are not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Holdco. Because the number of Holdco Ordinary Shares to be issued to Naked stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the combined company ordinary shares to be issued in connection with the Merger may be less than expected.\nIf the conditions to the completion of the Merger are not met, the Merger will not occur.\nEven if the Merger is approved by our stockholders, additional specific conditions must be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable law) in order to complete the Merger, including, among others:\n\u00b7 The Registration Statement shall have become effective, and no stop order suspending effectiveness shall have been issued and remain in effect,\n\u00b7 the completion of the Reorganization (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of Holdco;\n\u00b7 the Holdco Ordinary Shares issuable to Naked\u2019s stockholders in the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement will have been authorized for listing on the Nasdaq or NYSE,\n\u00b7 no governmental entity shall have enacted any law or order which is in effect and which has the effect of making the Merger, the Reorganization or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger, the Reorganization or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\n\u00b7 no action, suit or proceeding shall be pending or threatened before any governmental entity which is reasonably expected to, among other things, prevent consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or cause any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be rescinded following consummation,\n\u00b7 the representations and warranties of each party to the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct subject to certain materiality qualifiers, and\n\u00b7 each party shall have performed or complied with all agreements and covenants required by the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the closing date.\nThese and other conditions are described in detail in the Merger Agreement. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied. If the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable law), the Merger will not occur or will be delayed, and Naked may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Merger.\nDelays in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the expected benefits of the Merger.\nSatisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the Merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, Naked expects. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed in order to complete the Merger may materially adversely affect the benefits that Holdco and Naked expect to achieve from the Merger and the integration of their respective businesses. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, either of Naked and Holdco may terminate the Merger Agreement on notice to the other if the Merger is not completed by June 1, 2018, (as such date may be extended in accordance with the Merger Agreement.\nShould the Merger not qualify as tax free reorganization, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Naked stockholders may recognize income, gain or loss in connection with the Merger.\nIt is expected that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties, however, did not seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the tax consequences of the Merger. The failure of the Merger to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes could result in a Naked stockholder recognizing income, gain or loss with respect to the shares of Naked common stock surrendered by such stockholder.\nFailure or delay in obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals could cause the Merger not to be completed or to be postponed.\nTo complete the Merger and all transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Holdco must comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq in connection with the issuance and listing of shares of Holdco Ordinary Shares and the filing of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC. Failure or delay in obtaining any necessary approvals could cause the Merger not to be completed or to be postponed, which may materially adversely affect the benefits that Bendon and Naked expect to achieve from the Merger and the integration of their respective businesses.\nNaked stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the Merger.\nCurrent holders of Naked common stock will not be entitled to dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights in the Merger with respect to their shares of Naked common stock under Nevada law. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), each share of Naked common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by Naked or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Naked, Inc., which will be cancelled at the Effective Time without further consideration) will be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive one Holdco Ordinary Share.\nDeclines in Holdco\u2019s stock price or financial results could give rise to stockholder litigation and potential liability.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the combined company\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nHoldco is not expected to pay dividends on its shares of ordinary shares in the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, it is expected that the combined company will continue to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of its business, and not to pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in the combined company will be if the market price of the ordinary shares appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares that will prevail in the market after the Merger will ever exceed the value of the Holdco Ordinary Shares exchanged in the Merger.\nThere may be less publicly available information concerning Holdco than there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because it is anticipated that Holdco will be considered a foreign private issuer and will be exempt from a number of rules under the Exchange Act and will be permitted to file less information with the SEC than issuers that are not foreign private issuers. Holdco, as a foreign private issuer, will be permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the Nasdaq, subject to certain exceptions.\nA foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act is exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, and is not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, or to comply with Regulation FD, which restricts the selective disclosure of material non-public information. It is anticipated that Holdco will be exempt from certain disclosure and procedural requirements applicable to proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. The members of Holdco\u2019s management board, officers and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and \u201cshort-swing\u201d profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning Holdco than there is for companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, and such information may not be provided as promptly as it is provided by such companies.\nIn addition, certain information may be provided by Holdco in accordance with Australian law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act. Further, as a foreign private issuer, under the Nasdaq rules Holdco may be subject to less stringent corporate governance requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of Nasdaq (and the NYSE) permit a foreign private issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of Nasdaq, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as board, committee and director independence requirements. Holdco would be required to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. domestic companies under Nasdaq listing standards in its annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC or on its website. Although Holdco presently does not intend to rely on its home country practice in lieu of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, there can be no assurance it won\u2019t elect to do so in the future. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are required to comply with all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nHoldco may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Holdco would not be required to comply with all the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations. The determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually. There is a risk that Holdco will lose its foreign private issuer status in the future. Holdco would lose its foreign private issuer status if, for example, more than 50% of its assets are located in the U.S. and Holdco\u2019s continue to fail to meet additional requirements necessary to maintain our foreign private issuer status. The regulatory and compliance costs to Holdco under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly greater than the costs Holdco will incur as a foreign private issuer. If Holdco is not a foreign private issuer, it will be required to file periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and extensive in certain respects than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. Holdco would be required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and modify certain of its policies to comply with corporate governance practices associated with U.S. domestic issuers. Such conversion and modifications would involve additional costs. In addition, Holdco may lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements on U.S. stock exchanges that are available to foreign private issuers, which could also increase Holdco\u2019s costs.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Holdco Ordinary Shares\nCurrently, there is no public market for Holdco Ordinary Shares. Naked stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for or of the market price of the Holdco Ordinary Shares they will receive.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each share of Naked Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive one Holdco Ordinary Share. Holdco is newly formed entity and prior to this transaction it has not issued any securities in the U.S. markets or elsewhere nor has there been extensive information about it, its businesses or operations publicly available. Under the Merger Agreement, Bendon and Holdco have agreed to use their best efforts to cause the Holdco Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq or NYSE prior to the effective time of the Merger and the approval of the listing on the Nasdaq or NYSE of the Holdco Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger is a condition to the closing of the Merger. In accordance with these provisions of the Merger Agreement, Holdco has applied to list the Holdco Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will approve Holdco\u2019s application, and even if it does, the listing of the shares on Nasdaq does not assure that a market for the Holdco Ordinary Shares will develop or the price at which the shares will trade. No assurance can be provided as to the demand for or trading price of Holdco Ordinary Shares following the closing of the Merger and the Holdco Ordinary Shares may trade at a price less than the current market price of Naked Common Stock.\nEven if the combined company is successful in developing a public market, there may not be enough liquidity in such market to enable shareholders to sell their ordinary shares. If a public market for the combined Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares does not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell their ordinary shares, rendering their shares illiquid and possibly resulting in a complete loss of their investment. Holdco cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the combined company will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. The trading price of and demand for Holdco Ordinary Shares following completion of the Merger and the development and continued existence of a market and favorable price for the Holdco Ordinary Shares will depend on a number of conditions, including the development of a market following, including by analysts and other investment professionals, the businesses, operations, results and prospects of Holdco, general market and economic conditions, governmental actions, regulatory considerations, legal proceedings and developments or other factors. These and other factors may impair the development of a liquid market and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for Holdco Ordinary Shares to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise affect negatively the price and liquidity of Holdco Ordinary Shares. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of Holdco or Holdco shareholders.\nHoldCo\u2019s share price may be volatile and could decline substantially.\nThe market price of Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares may be volatile, both because of actual and perceived changes in the company\u2019s financial results and prospects, and because of general volatility in the stock market. The factors that could cause fluctuations in Holdco\u2019s share price may include, among other factors discussed in this section, the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in the financial results and prospects of the company or other companies in the apparel\n\u00b7 business;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by Wall Street research analysts;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in the United States economy or the retailing environment;\n\u00b7 changes in the market valuations of other specialty apparel companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by Holdco or its competitors;\n\u00b7 mergers or other business combinations involving Holdco;\n\u00b7 additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting principles;\n\u00b7 the passage of legislation or other developments affecting Holdco or its industry;\n\u00b7 the trading volume of Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares in the public market;\n\u00b7 changes in economic conditions;\n\u00b7 financial market conditions;\n\u00b7 natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war or periods of civil unrest; and\n\u00b7 the realization of some or all of the risks described in this section.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations from time to time, and the market prices of the equity securities of apparel companies have been extremely volatile and are sometimes subject to sharp price and trading volume changes. These broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares.\nThe financial performance, and price of the ordinary shares, of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Naked.\nUpon completion of the Merger, holders of Naked common stock will become holders of ordinary shares of Holdco. The business and target markets of Holdco and the combined company differ from those of Naked, and accordingly the results of operations and the price of Holdco Ordinary Shares will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations and stock price of Naked.\nThe combined company\u2019s stock price is expected to be volatile, and the market price of the combined company ordinary shares may drop following the Merger. The market price of the combined company\u2019s ordinary shares could be subject to significant fluctuations following the Merger. Moreover, stock markets generally have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. Such market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company\u2019s ordinary shares. Declines in the combined company\u2019s stock price after the Merger may result for a number of reasons including if:\n\u00b7 investors react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business and prospects from the Merger;\n\u00b7 the effects of the Merger on the combined company\u2019s business and prospects are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts;\n\u00b7 the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts; or\n\u00b7 other factors beyond the combined company\u2019s control, including but not limited to fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to the combined company.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, have and may continue to negatively affect the market price of Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about Holdco or its business, its ordinary shares price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the Holdco\u2019s ordinary shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about Holdco or its business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on Holdco. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of Holdco, the trading price for its ordinary shares would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover Holdco downgrade its securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about its business, its stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Holdco or fail to publish reports on Holdco, demand for its ordinary shares could decrease, which might cause its ordinary share price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15905, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "NAKD.1"}
