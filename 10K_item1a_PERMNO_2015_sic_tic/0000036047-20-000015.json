{"cik": "36047", "company": "CORELOGIC, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA cyber-based attack, data corruption, network security breach, or inability to secure the electronic transmission of sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit, and store electronic information. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and security breaches of varying degrees to our infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, spoofed or manipulated electronic communications and similar breaches, which have in the past, and may in the future, create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information and consumer data, or loss of other company assets. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as \"phishing\", could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern. Despite our physical security, implementation of technical controls and contractual precautions to identify, detect, and prevent the unauthorized access to and alteration and disclosure of our data, we cannot protect the systems that access our services and databases from all compromises or disruptions, whether as a result of criminal conduct, distributed denial of service attacks or other advanced persistent attacks by malicious actors, including hackers, nation states and criminals, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions. Several highly publicized data incidents and cyberattacks have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems. Cyber attackers are also developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities. If we are unable to protect against, mitigate, or timely respond to cyber-based attacks or other security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits, or other regulatory restrictions or penalties.\nData security and integrity concerns have caused a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies to impose consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy, and security of such data are possible. In the US, federal and state laws provide for a regulatory landscape of disparate notification regimes and, therefore, regulatory compliance in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability through federal or state enforcement, reputational harm, or private class actions. Likewise, our clients are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our clients, it could negatively affect our relationships with those clients or increase our operating costs.\nWe rely on the ability to access data from external sources at reasonable terms and prices.\nWe rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our clients. Our data sources could cease providing or reduce the availability of their data to us, increase the price we pay for their data, or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially-imposed restrictions on use. If a significant supplier is no longer able or is unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data become unavailable or too expensive, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs, and reduced quality and availability of our services. Moreover, some of our data suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases from them and they may elect to stop providing data to us. Significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and our financial position, in particular if we are unable to arrange for substitute replacement sources of data on favorable economic terms. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSome of our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements as we do and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data, which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, such advocates and regulators are seeking further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors as well as contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. Any future laws, regulations, or other restrictions limiting the dissemination or use of personal information may reduce the quality and availability of the data necessary for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSystems interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services.\nWe depend on reliable, stable, efficient, and uninterrupted operation of our technology network, systems, and data centers to provide service to our clients. System interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, resulting in a loss of clients and a corresponding loss in revenue. Our technology infrastructure runs primarily in a private dedicated cloud-based environment hosted in NTT's technology center in Quincy, WA and we are in the process of transitioning to a cloud-based environment hosted by GCP. We cannot be sure that certain systems interruptions or events beyond our control, including issues with NTT's technology center or our third-party network and infrastructure providers, in connection with our upgrading or changing key systems, or the transition to the GCP, will not interrupt or terminate the delivery of our products and services to our clients. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide necessary data to us and our employees' ability to attend to work and perform their responsibilities. Any of these possible outcomes could result in a loss of clients or a loss in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe are subject to significant government regulations.\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. See Item 1. Business - \u201cRegulation\u201d in this Form 10-K for a summary of the material US and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to provide certain services or result in the imposition of fines and penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and loss of revenue. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in our attempt to ensure compliance with these laws.\nPublic concern is high with regard to the collection, use, accuracy, correction, and sharing of personal information, including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, financial information, and other behavioral data. In addition, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, legislatures, and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect consumer privacy and have become increasingly concerned with the collection and use of personal information. Highly publicized data incidents have resulted in significantly increased legislative and regulatory activity at the federal and state levels as lawmakers and regulators continue to propose a wide range of further restrictions on the collection, dissemination or commercial use of personal information, information security standards, data security incident disclosure standards. Because our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are\nsubject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. We acquire, store, use, and provide many types of consumer data and related services, some of which are subject to regulation under the FCRA, the GLBA, the CCPA and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. The CCPA, for example, which became effective January 1, 2020, imposes new obligations on certain companies doing business in California with respect to the personal information of California residents. This includes new notice and privacy policy requirements, and new obligations to respond to requests to know and access to personal information, to delete personal information, and to say no to the sale of personal information. We expect that there will be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulations similar to the GDPR, a data protection and privacy law in the European Union that became effective in 2018, and the CCPA. Compliance with these laws may impose significant regulatory burdens and costs on us. Further, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy, and security of such data are possible. In the US, state laws provide for disparate notification regimes. In addition, if our practices or products are deemed to be an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, we may be subject to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense, and loss of revenue.\nOur businesses are subject to an increasing degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by our clients. Specifically, the CFPB has authority to enact rules affecting the business of consumer reporting agencies and also to supervise, conduct examinations of, and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations with respect to certain \u201clarger participants\u201d that offer consumer financial products and services. Two of our credit businesses-CoreLogic Credco and Teletrack-are subject to the CFPB non-bank supervision program and the CFPB or other regulatory bodies could attempt to assert authority over other products or services. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) also have the authority to examine us in our role as a service provider for certain services, including for tax services, to large financial institutions. In addition, several of our largest bank clients are subject to consent orders with the OCC and/or are parties to the National Mortgage Settlement, both of which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key vendors such as us. The CFPB may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce the laws and rules subject to its jurisdiction. In these proceedings the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders, which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts, as well as other types of affirmative relief, and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations and up to $1.0 million per day for knowing violations.\nThese laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations in the various states or in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs or restrictions on us, result in significant loss of revenue, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could also result in significant liability to us, including liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation, or may result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. Our operations could also be negatively affected by changes to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our clients and us. These changes may compel us to change our prices, may restrict our ability to implement price increases, and may limit the manner in which we conduct our business or otherwise may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings, and cash flows. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative impact on our clients, we may experience client losses or increased operating costs, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur revenue is affected by the strength of the economy, interest rate environment and the housing market generally.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from solutions we provide to the mortgage, consumer lending, and real estate industries and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market or adverse changes in the interest rate environment may adversely affect our business. A large portion of our client base suffers when financial markets experience volatility, illiquidity, and disruption, which has occurred in the past and which could reoccur, and any future disruptions of the financial markets presents considerable risks to our business and revenue. The volume of mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable. Reductions in these transaction volumes have had, and will continue to have, a direct impact on certain portions of our revenues and may materially adversely affect our business. Negative economic conditions or increasing interest rate environments has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in volumes, pricing, and operating margins for our services. If our clients in the mortgage consumer lending and real estate industries experience economic hardship, in\nparticular if these clients go bankrupt or otherwise exit certain businesses, it may negatively impact our revenue, earnings, and liquidity.\nWe rely on our top ten clients for a significant portion of our revenue.\nOur ten largest clients generated approximately 29.8% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, although none of our largest clients individually accounted for greater than 10% of our operating revenues for that period. We expect that a limited number of our clients will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and that our concentration of revenue may continue to be significant or increase. These clients face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of our relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to our future operating results, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, clients in the mortgage lending industry may have internal policies that require them to use multiple vendors or service providers, thereby causing a diversification of revenue among many vendors. Deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships, including through vendor diversification policies or merger or consolidation among our clients, could significantly reduce our revenue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, certain of our businesses have higher client concentration than our company as a whole. As a result, these businesses may be disproportionately affected by declining revenue from, or loss of, a significant client.\nWe operate in a competitive business environment that is impacted by technology advancements or new product development.\nThe markets for our products and services are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. We compete for existing and new clients against both third parties and the in-house capabilities of our clients. Many of our competitors have substantial resources. Some have widely-used technology platforms that they seek to use as a competitive advantage to drive sales of other products and services. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. These competitors and new technologies may be disruptive to our existing technology or service offerings, resulting in operating inefficiencies and increased competitive pressure. In order to compete with current and future technologies, we must continuously improve our network operating systems, programming tools, programming languages, operating systems, data matching, data filtering, and other database technologies. These improvements, as well as changes in client preferences or regulatory requirements, may require changes in the technology used to gather and process our data and deliver our services. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to internally develop and implement new and competitive technologies, respond to changing client needs and regulatory requirements, and transition clients and data sources successfully to new interfaces or other technologies.\nIn addition, many of our products and services compete within markets characterized by frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and services, our products and services could become commercially obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to properly identify client needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications; successfully commercialize new products and services in a timely manner; produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings; price our products competitively, including taking into account changes in sales and use tax laws; and anticipate our competitors\u2019 development of new products, services, or technological innovations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that there will be market demand for our future product offerings or that we will successfully implement new technologies, cause clients or data furnishers to implement compatible technologies or adapt our technology to evolving client, regulatory and competitive requirements. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively allocate capital to new product development to create competitive products, as compared to our peers and new market entrants. Failure to launch new and differentiated products will have an adverse effect on our growth and our business. If we fail to respond, or fail to cause our clients or data furnishers to respond, to changes in technology, regulatory requirements or client preferences, the demand for our services, the delivery of our services or our market reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on outsourcing arrangements subjects us to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect our operations.\nWe have outsourced various business process and information technology services to third parties, including the technology infrastructure management services agreement we entered into with NTT and the outsourcing arrangements we entered into with a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions and an affiliate of EPAM Systems. Although we have service-level arrangements with our providers, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. In addition, the failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us vulnerable to changes in the vendors\u2019\nbusiness, financial condition, and other matters outside of our control, including their violations of laws or regulations which could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. The failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations and to the services we provide to our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our business, client relationships, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.\nCertain outsource arrangements contemplate the utilization of lower-cost labor outside the US in countries such as India, Poland, Ukraine, Mexico, and the Philippines. It is possible that the countries where our outsourcing vendors are located may be subject to higher degrees of political and social instability than the US and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions could impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent could decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Fluctuations of the US dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce the savings we planned to achieve. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the US and, as a result, many of our clients may require us to use labor based in the US. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced US-based labor to our clients, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the US or the foreign countries in which we have service provider arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that would adversely affect our business by making it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the FCPA. Any violations of the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\nOur acquisition and integration of businesses may involve increased expenses and may not produce the desired financial or operating results.\nWe have acquired and expect to continue to acquire, on an opportunistic basis, companies, businesses, products and services. These activities may increase our expenses, and the expected results, synergies, and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned. While management believes that acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, no assurance can be given that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings. For a description of our recent acquisitions, see Note 17 - Acquisitions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may have difficulty integrating our completed or any future acquisitions into our operations, including implementing controls, procedures, and policies. If we fail to properly integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies, and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. Although part of our business strategy may include growth through strategic acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue acquisitions or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms in the future.\nIn addition, we have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and an impairment of these investments would require a write-down that would reduce our net income. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends. In the event that the book value of goodwill is impaired, any such impairment would be charged against earnings in the period of impairment. Possible future impairment of goodwill may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate our business in international markets.\nIn 2019, we derived approximately 10% of our revenues from our operations outside of the US and we intend to continue to expand our international operations. We expect to continue to add personnel internationally to expand our abilities to deliver differentiated services to our international clients. Expansion into international markets may require significant resources and management's attention and will subject us to new regulatory, economic, and political risks. There can be no assurance that our products or services will be accepted in any particular international market and we cannot provide assurance that our international expansion efforts will be successful. The results of our operations and our growth rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors arising out of international commerce, some of which are beyond our control, including currency rate fluctuations, foreign laws and regulatory requirements, trade protection measures, increased data privacy and consumer\nprotection regulations, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, restrictions on the import and export of technologies, political and economic conditions in foreign countries, and reduced protection for intellectual property rights.\nWe could infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nAs we continue to develop and expand our products and services, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims from third parties such as non-practicing entities, software providers, and suppliers of data. Likewise, if we are unable to maintain adequate controls over how third-party software and data are used, we may be subject to claims of infringement. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our applications, if feasible;\n\u2022\ndivert management's attention and resources;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant damages, penalties, fines, and costs associated with an adverse judgment or settlement.\nWe rely upon intellectual property rights to protect our, proprietary technology and information.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from complying with our covenants and obligations under our outstanding debt instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total debt was approximately $1.7 billion and we had unused commitments of approximately $750.0 million under our Revolving Facility. Subject to the limitations contained in the Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities and our other debt instruments, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could increase. Specifically, our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and compromising our flexibility to capitalize our business opportunities and to plan for, or react to, competitive pressures and changes in our business or market conditions.\nThe Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities imposes operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions include the financial covenants in our credit facilities, which require ongoing compliance with certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, and could limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume additional debt;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022\nredeem and/or prepay certain subordinated debt we might issue in the future;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions, including joint ventures;\n\u2022\nenter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nengage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in specified sales of assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could negatively impact our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, or other corporate opportunities that might otherwise be\nbeneficial to us. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and could terminate their revolving commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified management personnel.\nWe rely on skilled management personnel and our success depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain a sufficient number of such individuals. If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for talented individuals not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services, and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of individuals who have the skills and training needed to grow our company, especially in the increasingly-regulated environment in which we operate. Increased attrition or competition for qualified management could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and product offerings, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.\nWe share responsibility with First American for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Separation.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement, by and between FAC and FAFC, dated as of June 1, 2010 we entered into in connection with the Separation transaction, we are generally responsible for taxes attributable to our business, assets and liabilities and FAFC is generally responsible for all taxes attributable to members of the FAFC group of companies and the assets, liabilities, or businesses of the FAFC group of companies. Generally, any liabilities arising from tax adjustments to consolidated tax returns for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Separation will be shared in proportion to each company's percentage of the tax liability for the relevant year (or partial year with respect to 2010), unless the adjustment is attributable to either party, in which case the adjustment will generally be for the account of such party. In addition to this potential liability associated with adjustments for prior periods, if FAFC were to fail to pay any tax liability it is required to pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such tax liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of tax liabilities.\nIf certain transactions, including internal transactions, undertaken in anticipation of the Separation are determined to be taxable for US federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to US federal income tax and FAFC will incur significant US federal income tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the Separation we received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation will qualify for favorable treatment under the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u2018\u2018Code\u2019\u2019), and the contribution by us of certain assets of the financial services businesses to FAFC and the pro-rata distribution to our shareholders of the common stock of FAFC will, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualify as a tax-free transaction for US federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, we received opinions of tax counsel to similar effect. The ruling and opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and FAFC regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that were not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or FAFC after the Separation. If the Separation is determined to be taxable for US federal and state income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to income tax could incur significant income tax liabilities.\nIn addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event a transaction were determined to be taxable and such determination were the result of actions taken after the Separation by us or FAFC, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or FAFC as a result thereof.\nMoreover, the Tax Sharing Agreement generally provides that each party thereto is responsible for any taxes imposed on the other party as a result of the failure of the distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction under the Code if such failure is attributable to post-Separation actions taken by or in respect of the responsible party or its stockholders, regardless of when the actions occur after the Separation, and the other party consents to such actions or such party obtains a favorable letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel as described above.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a number of agreements with FAFC setting forth rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation. In addition, certain provisions of these agreements provide protection to FAFC in the event of a change of control of us, which could reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and FAFC entered into a number of agreements that set forth certain rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, and the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. We possess certain rights under those agreements, including without limitation indemnity rights from certain liabilities allocated to FAFC. The failure of FAFC to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement gives FAFC the right to purchase the equity or assets of our entity or entities directly or indirectly owning the real property databases that we currently own upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The triggering events include the direct or indirect purchase of the databases by a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) or an entity licensed as a title insurance underwriter, including a transaction where a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) acquires 25% or more of us. The purchase right expires June 1, 2020. Until the expiration of the purchase right, this provision could have the effect of limiting or discouraging an acquisition of us or preventing a change of control that our stockholders might consider favorable. Likewise, if a triggering event occurs, the loss of ownership of our real property database could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 35124, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "CLGX"}
