{"cik": "1362190", "company": "AUDIOEYE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered, together with all the other information included in this Form 10-K, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the SEC. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of generating significant losses and may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.\nTo date, we have not been profitable, and we may never achieve profitability on a full-year or consistent basis. We incurred net losses of $7,158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $57,084,000. If we continue to experience losses, we may not be able to continue our operations, and investors may lose their entire investment.\nOur success is dependent on members of our management team and employees, many of whom are relatively new in their positions with the Company.\nOur success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management team and employees, including our engineers, product managers, sales and marketing personnel, and professional services personnel. Many members of our executive management team and our employees are relatively new to their positions, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Strategy Officer and our President, both of whom were appointed to their respective positions in August 2020. Our senior management team has not worked with other members of management and our employees for a significant period of time. We can provide no assurance that our management team will be able to effectively work together or with our employees. If they are unable to do so, there may be delays in execution of our business and operating strategies.\nWe may not receive forgiveness of all or a portion of our PPP Loan.\nAs discussed in this report, including in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein, on April 15, 2020, we entered into a note agreement in the amount of $1,302,000 with Liberty Capital Bank (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, which is being administered by the Small Business Administration. All or a portion of the Loan may be forgiven upon application by the Company in accordance with the Small Business Administration requirements. In October 2020, we submitted our application to obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in full. No assurance can be provided, however, that we will obtain forgiveness of all or a portion of the PPP Loan. If we are unable to obtain forgiveness of all or a portion of the PPP Loan, our liquidity could be reduced, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to pursue business through a variety of new channels. The new channels may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources and costs, and we cannot guarantee we will fully realize the expected benefits.\nWe intend to pursue business through a variety of new channels. Although we may devote significant resources and costs to the development of the new sales channels, we may struggle to successfully identify the channel partners, or to successfully conclude transactions with the channel partners. Should we be unable to identify or conclude important channel partnerships, or if our partners are unable to meet our expectations, our business prospects and operations could be adversely affected as a result of the devotion of significant managerial effort required. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would fully realize the potential benefit of the relationships. If we cannot do so, we may be unable to meet future revenue expectations.\nOur new technology platform may not function as expected or may not be accepted by our clients.\nWe released a new platform for our digital accessibility product in the first quarter of 2021. We cannot guarantee that our platform will operate as expected or that our new platform will be accepted by our customers. If our new platform does not operate as expected or is not accepted, our ability to pursue and retain business may be damaged and our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future development will require additional capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, which would prevent us from fully developing our business and generating revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $9.1 million in cash. Our business plan will require additional capital expenditures, and our capital outlays could increase substantially over the next several years as we implement our business plan. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through future private or public equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others: market conditions, sales and marketing costs, mergers and acquisition activity, if any, costs of litigation in enforcing our intellectual property rights, and information technology development and acquisition costs. No assurance can be given that we can successfully raise additional equity or debt capital, or that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\nWeakened global economic conditions including current and ongoing microeconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly, and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the coronavirus pandemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. For example, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of IT spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our software, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, affect attrition rates, or decrease our ability to collect on accounts receivable, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nWe have been subject to litigation and may in the future be subject to additional litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in disputes and allegations related to our business operations. Because we are in a technology industry, these disputes may involve claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. We have also been involved in securities law litigation in the past. These types of litigation can be very expensive, and we cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover the costs. Because it is not possible to determine when and whether these disputes and allegations may arise or the ultimate disposition of such matters, the resolution of any such matters, should they arise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on future debt and could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make financing, including the financing of any acquisition, costlier. We may incur variable interest rate indebtedness in the future. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increased interest expense on refinanced indebtedness.\nWe may pursue new strategic opportunities which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such opportunities.\nWe may seek strategic opportunities to help us pursue our business objectives. Although we may devote significant time and resources in pursuit of such transactions, we may struggle to successfully identify such opportunities, or to successfully conclude transactions. Should we be unable to identify or conclude important strategic transactions, our business prospects and operations could be adversely affected as a result of the devotion of significant managerial effort required, and the challenges of achieving our objectives in the absence of strategic opportunities. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed, and in combining its operations with ours if such a transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition or strategic relationship in the future, we cannot assure you that we would fully realize the potential benefit of such a transaction or that we would not be subject to unknown liabilities.\nOur business plan may not be realized. If our business plan proves to be unsuccessful, our business may fail, and you may lose your entire investment.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise with a limited operating history. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of a new business. Unanticipated events may occur that could affect the actual results achieved during the forecast periods. Consequently, the actual results of operations during the forecast periods will vary from the forecasts, and such variations may be material. In addition, the degree of uncertainty increases with each successive year presented in our business plan. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in the anticipated operation of our business plan. If our business plan proves to be unsuccessful, our business may fail, and you may lose your entire investment.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience competition as more companies seek to provide products and services similar to our products and services, and because larger and better-financed competitors may affect our ability to compete in the marketplace and achieve profitability, our business may fail.\nCompetition in our market is intense, and we expect competition for our products and services to become even more intense. We compete directly against other companies offering similar products and services that compete or will compete directly with our proposed products and services. We also compete against established vendors in our markets. These companies may incorporate other competitive technologies into their product offerings, whether developed internally or by third parties. There are also established consultants who offer services to help their customers obtain compliance with accessibility standards. In many cases these consultants compete for the same funding from our prospective customers. For the foreseeable future, many of our competitors may be larger, better-financed companies that may develop products superior to our current and proposed products, which could create significant competitive advantages for those companies. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively with our competitors. As a result, we may have difficulty competing with larger, established competitors. Generally, these competitors may have:\n\u00b7 substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources;\n\u00b7 a larger customer base;\n\u00b7 better name recognition; and\n\u00b7 more expansive or different product offerings.\nThese competitors may command a larger market share than we do, which may enable them to establish a stronger competitive position, in part, through greater marketing opportunities. Further, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we are to new or emerging technologies and changes in user preferences and to devote greater resources to developing new products and offering new services. These competitors may develop products or services that are comparable or superior to ours. If we fail to address competitive developments quickly and effectively, we may not be able to remain a viable business.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our patented rights, our operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to compete largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We cannot assure you that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business.\nRegardless of whether any future claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending against such claims could cause us to incur significant costs, could jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome in any future litigation, and could divert resources away from our other activities. In addition, assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products. In addition to challenges against our existing patents, any of the following could also reduce the value of our intellectual property now, or in the future:\n\u00b7 our applications for patents, trademarks, and copyrights relating to our business may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u00b7 issued trademarks, copyrights or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u00b7 our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u00b7 our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, competitive with, or superior to those that we develop.\nAlso, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. Obtaining patents will not necessarily protect our technology or prevent our international competitors from developing similar products or technologies. Our inability to adequately protect our patented rights may have a negative impact on our operations and revenues.\nIn addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the Internet and Internet-related businesses, patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology. There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we believe that there has been, and is likely to continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may commence legal proceedings against third parties who we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights, and if we are forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights, or to defend claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights, legal fees and court injunctions could adversely affect our financial condition and potentially end our business.\nWe have active litigation against a competitor related to the alleged violation of our patents and other unfair trade practices, and we may engage in future litigation. We expect an increase in the number of third parties who could violate our patents as the market develops new uses of similar products and consumers continue to increase their adoption of technology and integrate it into their daily lives. We foresee the potential need to enter into additional active litigation to defend and enforce our patents. We anticipate that these legal proceedings could continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. In the event we are not successful through appeal and do not subsequently obtain monetary and injunctive relief, these litigation matters may significantly reduce our financial resources and have a material impact on our ability to continue our operations. The time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue or defend these litigation matters may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, since time spent on matters related to the lawsuits would take away from the time spent on managing and operating the business. We cannot assure you any such potential lawsuits will result in an outcome that is favorable to our stockholders or the Company.\nThe current regulatory environment for our products and services remains unclear.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing or planned product and service offerings will be in compliance with local, state, and/or federal U.S. laws or the laws of any foreign jurisdiction where we operate or may operate in the future. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or that such laws will not be modified, or that new laws will not be enacted in the future, which would cause us to be in violation of such laws. More aggressive domestic or international regulation of the Internet may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects.\nOur business greatly depends on the growth of online services, Internet of Things (\u201cIOT\u201d), kiosks, streaming, and other next-generation Internet-based applications, and there is a risk that such growth may not occur as expected, or at all, which would harm our business.\nThe Internet may ultimately prove not to be a viable commercial marketplace for such applications for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7 unwillingness of consumers to shift to and use other such next-generation Internet-based audio applications;\n\u00b7 refusal to purchase our products and services;\n\u00b7 perception by end-users with respect to product and service quality and performance;\n\u00b7 limitations on access and ease of use;\n\u00b7 congestion leading to delayed or extended response times;\n\u00b7 inadequate development of Internet infrastructure to keep pace with increased levels of use; and\n\u00b7 increased government regulations.\nBecause of these and other factors, the growth of online services, IOT, kiosks, streaming, and other next-generation Internet-based applications may be impeded or not occur as expected. As a result, our business and operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf the market for our online services does not grow as anticipated, our business would be adversely affected.\nWhile other next-generation Internet-based applications have grown rapidly in personal and professional use, we cannot assure you that the adoption of our products and services will grow at a comparable rate or grow at all.\nOur expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks.\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy.\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\nGovernment regulation is evolving, and unfavorable changes could harm our business.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover website accessibility, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, the characteristics and quality of products and services, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities.\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales. However, an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state businesses to collect taxes on their behalf. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not currently do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nWe may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\nIf we do not successfully adapt, enhance or develop new products and services in a cost-effective manner to meet customer demand in the rapidly evolving market for next-generation Internet-based applications and services, our business may fail.\nThe market for next-generation Internet-based applications and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to use new technologies effectively, to continue to develop our technical expertise and proprietary technology, to enhance our existing products and services, and to develop new products and services that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements, and industry standards. If we fail to use new technologies effectively, to develop our technical expertise and new products and services, or to enhance existing products and services on a timely basis, either internally or through arrangements with third parties, our product and service offerings may fail to meet customer needs, which would adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth.\nIn addition, if we are unable to, for technological, legal, financial, or other reasons, adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements, we could lose customers, strategic alliances, and market share. Sudden changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, the frequent introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing products, services and systems obsolete. The emerging nature of products and services in the technology and communications industry and their rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our products and services. Our survival and success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7 design, develop, launch and/or license our planned products, services, and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers; and\n\u00b7 respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nThe development of products and services and other patented technology involves significant technological and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time. We may be unable to use new technologies effectively. Updating our technology internally and licensing new technology from third parties may also require us to incur significant additional expenditures.\nIf our products and services do not continue to gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations.\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or services or any other products or services we develop or acquire, including, among others:\n\u00b7 the price of our products or services relative to other competitive products and services;\n\u00b7 the perception by users of the effectiveness of our products and services;\n\u00b7 our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our products and services do not continue to gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including the development of new products and services and/or our sales and marketing efforts for our current products and services, which inability would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe continually develop new products and product enhancements and actively capitalize software development costs, while making educated assumptions to anticipate the attributed revenue to be derived from each development or enhancement. If our assumptions are incorrect or if we are unable to accurately attribute revenue to each respective product or product enhancement, we may have to account for impairment, thus causing us to reverse the capitalized expenditures.\nOur product developers are consistently programming new products and enhancements to existing products. Under applicable accounting guidance, we make determinations to estimate the useful life of each of these products and enhancements. Based on these determinations, we amortize software expenses over a pre-determined period of time. Should our estimates turn out to be inaccurate or should the business fail to attract new revenue in relation to each respective product or product enhancement, we may have to reverse or write off the related capitalized expenses.\nOur products and services are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors or defects. Despite testing, some errors in our products and services may only be discovered after they have been installed and used by customers. Any errors or defects discovered in our products and services after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. The performance of our products and services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our products and services, which could result in legal claims against us, harming our business. Furthermore, we expect to provide implementation, consulting, and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products and services, which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing systems, and communications systems. Many of our contracts with customers contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, but such provisions may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert our management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products and services. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nMalfunctions of third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks we cannot control, and those risks could result in harm to our business.\nOur business depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties over which our product offerings are deployed. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or over whether those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. We do depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our integrated connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service in the future, our operations could be adversely impacted. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our products and services do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain strategic partners and customers.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, and computer hacking attacks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, or the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nOur corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or any third-party data we may possess. Any such security breach could require us to comply with various breach notification laws and may expose us to litigation, remediation and investigation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, and potential liability.\nSystem failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business.\nThe success of our product and service offerings depends on the uninterrupted operation of various systems, secure data centers, and other computer and communication networks that we use or establish. To the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products and services suddenly increases, the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times, service interruptions or delays or system failures. The deployment of our products, services, systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7 power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;\n\u00b7 damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7 computer viruses or software defects; and\n\u00b7 physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.\nSystem interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of our products and services to users. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our products and services do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain strategic partners and customers\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future, which will affect the extent to which our investors realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified operations, marketing and sales personnel as well as technical personnel. Inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business. Competition for technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel is intense, particularly in the technology and Internet sectors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such personnel.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to report financial results accurately or on a timely basis, or to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nIn connection with this annual report, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, primarily due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described in this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2020.\nOur failure to establish and maintain the required internal control over financial reporting, and to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, or any failure of those controls or procedures once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Upon review of the required internal control over financial reporting, our management and/or our auditors have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses and/or significant deficiencies that need to be addressed. Any actual or perceived weaknesses or conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure of management's assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of our independent registered public accounting firm's attestation to or report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, or our failure to obtain such an attestation or report, could adversely impact the price of and our ability to list our common stock and may lead to stockholder claims and regulatory action against us. Failure to remediate our current material weaknesses or to maintain effective internal controls in the future could also result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and that could cause us to restate our financial statements for a prior period, cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and/or limit our ability to raise capital.\nAdditionally, any such failure may also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic and other reports with the SEC, consume a significant amount of management's time, and cause us to incur substantial additional costs relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Common Stock\nAlthough our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, historically we have had a limited trading volume and a higher price volatility. This may result in reduced liquidity of our common stock.\nAlthough our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cAEYE,\u201d historically trading volume in our common stock has been limited. In addition, our stock has also historically seen significant price volatility, which may reduce the liquidity of our common stock. The sale of a significant number of shares of common stock at any particular time could be difficult to achieve at the market prices prevailing immediately before such shares are offered, and may limit your liquidity options.\nIf we cannot continue to satisfy the continuing listing criteria of the Nasdaq Capital Market, the exchange may subsequently delist our common stock.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market requires us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of holders of our securities, as well as meet certain disclosure and corporate governance requirements. If we fail to meet any of the continuing listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses by our investors.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7 the outcomes of potential future patent litigation;\n\u00b7 our ability to monetize our future patents;\n\u00b7 changes in our industry;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements by us or others;\n\u00b7 announcements by us of significant strategic partnerships, out-licensing, in-licensing, joint ventures, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by security analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;\n\u00b7 investors\u2019 general perception of us;\n\u00b7\nfuture issuances of common stock;\n\u00b7 investors\u2019 future resales of our securities;\n\u00b7 the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 general market conditions, including the volatility of market prices for shares of technology companies, generally, and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses by our investors.\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in the past. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock.\nPrice volatility of our common stock might be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low. In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. We have previously been the target of securities litigation and may in the future be subject to additional securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs to us and divert resources and attention of management from our business, even if we are successful in any such litigation. Future sales of our common stock could also reduce the market price of such stock.\nMoreover, the liquidity of our common stock is limited, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but by delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us, if any. These factors may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future.\nSales or the availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to our currently effective Registration Statement on Form S-3, such sales or the anticipation of such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Such circumstances, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWhen we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, including under our at-the-market program, in future financings or upon conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders and may also result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a $0.00001 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $0.00001 par value per share, of which, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 10,130,000 shares of common stock and 90,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, based upon the applicable conversion rate as of December 31, 2020, were at such time convertible into an aggregate of approximately 263,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we also had outstanding warrants and options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 598,000 shares of our common stock and unvested, or vested but not yet settled, restricted stock units covering an aggregate of approximately 958,000 shares of common stock. The exercise of such options and warrants and the vesting or vesting and settlement of such restricted stock units would further increase the number of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nIn addition, in February 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $30 million.\nFrom time to time, we may adopt new equity compensation plans or increase the number of shares available for issuance in connection with our existing equity compensation plans. Our board of directors may also choose to issue some or all of our available shares to provide additional financing or acquire businesses in the future.\nThe issuance of any shares upon conversion of any preferred stock, including our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, under our equity compensation plans, for acquisition, licensing or financing efforts, upon exercise of warrants and options, or upon settlement of restricted stock units or in financings will dilute the interests of our holders of common stock and cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all then current stockholders. Any such issuances may also result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nThe interests of our controlling stockholders may not coincide with yours and such controlling stockholders may make decisions with which you may disagree.\nAs of February 3, 2021, five of our stockholders, two of whom are our Executive Chairman and our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Strategy Officer, and another of whom is a director, beneficially owned in the aggregate over 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. As a result, these stockholders may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and make some future transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of our controlling stockholders. The interests of our controlling stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have new research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe are subject to financial reporting and other requirements that place significant demands on our resources.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, such as occurred as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. Moreover, effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. We may also face claims by our investors, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Charter Documents and Capital Structure\nWe are close to being controlled by a small number of \u201cinsider\u201d stockholders, which could determine corporate and stockholder action on significant matters.\nAs of February 3, 2021, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 4,114,782 of our outstanding shares of common stock and 60,000 shares of our outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which represents approximately 41% of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. Through their collective ownership of our outstanding stock, such holders, if they were to act together, would be close to controlling the voting of our shares at all meetings of stockholders and, because the common stock does not have cumulative voting rights, to determining the outcome of the election of all of our directors and determining corporate and stockholder action on other matters.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, as well as statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock, which may be divided into series and with the preferences, limitations and relative rights to be determined by our board of directors, and the right of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nDelaware law may delay or prevent takeover attempts by third parties and therefore inhibit our stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions prevent any stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder acquired such stock ownership unless certain approvals were or are obtained from our board of directors or from the holders of 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the shares of our common stock owned by the 15% or more stockholder). Our board of directors can use these and other provisions to discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or a change in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price of our shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nFailure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our future operating activities will depend upon our ability to expand our support system to meet the demands of our growing business. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate acquired businesses (if any), become profitable in the future, or effectively manage any other change.\nThe elimination of the monetary liability of our directors under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and stockholders and requires indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent provided by Delaware law. Our bylaws also contain provisions that require the indemnification of our directors, officers and employees. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing limitation of liability and indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 18098, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AEYE"}
