RISK FACTORS\nHolding our shares involves various risks and uncertainties. The risks described in this section are among those that have had or could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on the value of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the value of our bonds.\nThe fair value of our bonds as reported on our balance sheet is impacted by changes in interest rates and credit spreads. As long-term rates rise or credit spreads increase, the value of our bonds will generally decline and these declines could be significant. Because most of our bonds are secured primarily by multifamily rental properties, increasing interest rates leading to higher mortgage rates may make it more difficult for buyers of multifamily properties to obtain mortgage financing and may depress the prices buyers are willing to pay, thereby decreasing the value of our collateral and thus our bonds.\nA signification portion of the Company\u2019s debt and derivatives on its balance sheet is comprised of total return swaps (\u201cTRSs\u201d), which subject us to certain risk.\nA TRS is a swap agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either floating or fixed, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset. In TRSs, the underlying asset, referred to as the referenced asset, is typically an equity index, a loan or a bond. In our TRSs, we make payments at a set rate that is floating and we receive from our counterparty an amount equal to the payments made on the referenced assets which currently consist of bonds and preferred stock in a mortgage lender and servicer. The cash flows from our TRSs are subject to the risks associated with the referenced asset (in most cases real estate related risks) and to credit risk of both the obligor on the referenced asset and the counterparty on our TRSs. Also, to the extent the associated referenced assets lose value, we are at risk of having to provide additional collateral. If we were unable to post such additional collateral, the referenced asset might be sold at a time when its full value could not be achieved and our existing collateral would be at risk.\nChanges in interest rates may increase our borrowing costs and decrease our cash flows and net income.\nAs short-term rates rise, our borrowing costs will increase and our net income will decline as our bond and other lending income is fixed and a significant portion of our debt is variable and tied to short-term rates. At December 31, 2014 we had $177.5 million notional of bond related TRSs (accounted for as either debt or derivatives) tied to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (\u201cSIFMA\u201d) 7-day municipal swap index. We also had $122.1 million of subordinate debt at December 31, 2014 with a pay rate of 75 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) that will reset to a variable rate during 2015. The variable rate on this debt will be tied to the London Interbank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) 3-month index plus a spread. Once the debt resets during 2015, our borrowing costs will be higher and will be subject to fluctuations of the LIBOR 3-month index. We also had $36.6 million notional of TRSs (accounted for as debt) tied to the LIBOR 3-month index.\nWe may from time to time enter into agreements to reduce our interest rate exposure, but such arrangements themselves have risk.\nWe may from time to time enter into contracts intended to reduce our interest rate risk. For example, we may enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and the counterparty agrees to pay us a floating rate of interest in order to create fixed rate debt to better match assets that pay on a fixed rate basis. We also may enter into interest rate caps whereby we pay the counterparty on the interest rate cap a premium upfront and the counterparty pays us if the benchmark rate on the cap reaches a certain level. Interest rate swaps and caps have the risk that the counterparty fails to meet its payment obligations. There is also a risk that these contracts do not perform as expected and may cost more than the benefits received. In the case of interest rate swaps, we also have the risk of collateral calls depending on changes in interest rates as compared to the benchmark rate on the interest rate contract.\nChanges in capitalization rates and interest rates may adversely affect the value of our real estate and our LIHTC business line.\nThe carrying value of our real estate is at fair value when initially recorded and is then evaluated for impairment or carried at the lower of cost or fair value depending on its balance sheet classification. The fair value of our real estate will generally decline if capitalization and discount rates rise. Furthermore, although we sold substantially all of our LIHTC asset management operations, we hold loan receivables from the purchaser and an option to acquire the purchaser of our asset management operations. The value of our loan receivables from the purchaser as well as the option to acquire the purchaser is dependent on the residual value of multifamily rental properties. The residual value of these rental properties will generally decline if capitalization and discount rates rise in the markets where these properties are located. These rates vary from market to market and our real estate in some markets could be more affected than our real estate in other markets.\nThe cash flows and value from our bond portfolio and real estate investments are dependent upon the quality of the related real estate collateral and can be impacted by the risks related to real estate.\nBecause a substantial portion of our assets are secured by real estate, or consist of real estate or investments in entities that own real estate, the value of our assets is subject to the risks associated with investments in real estate. Most of these investments are directly or indirectly secured by multifamily rental properties, and therefore the value of these investments may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions or other factors that adversely affect the real estate market generally, or the market for multifamily real estate and bonds secured by these properties in particular. These possible negative factors include, among others: (i) increasing levels of unemployment and other adverse economic conditions, regionally or nationally; (ii) decreased occupancy and rent levels due to supply and demand imbalances; (iii) changes in interest rates that affect the cost of our capital, the value of our bonds or the value of the real estate we own or have an interest in or that secures the bonds; and (iv) lack of or reduced availability of mortgage financing.\nMost of our investments derive their value from the cash flows generated by tenant leases. Many of the properties in which we have an interest have rent limitations that could adversely affect the ability to increase rents, as well as tenant income restrictions that may reduce the number of eligible tenants and, thus, occupancy rates at such properties. If, because of general economic conditions, local market conditions or property specific conditions, the tenants move out or cannot pay the rents charged on the specific units they lease, the owners (our borrowers) may not be able to lease the units to replacement tenants at full rent (or at all), in which case the cash flows from the properties may not be sufficient to pay interest on our bonds or loans and the value of our investments may decline. Real estate may also decline in value because of market conditions, environmental problems, casualty losses for which insurance proceeds are not sufficient to cover the loss, or condemnation proceedings.\nThe value of our assets and our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by changes in local or national laws or regulatory conditions that affect significant segments of the real estate market, especially the multifamily housing market, including environmental, land use and other laws and regulations that affect the cost of maintaining and operating the properties in which we have an interest.\nWe need to make new investments that grow shareholder value over the long term.\nThere is a risk that we will not be able to deploy our cash and or expand our leverage to make investments that generate risk-adjusted returns that sufficiently grow shareholder value. Also, because there are no restrictions as to the nature of our investments, our investments in the future may result in additional or new risks that we do not face today.\nWe face risks associated with our new energy capital business.\nWe recently established a new business to make development and construction loans for the purpose of building commercial scale solar facilities. This business is subject to construction risk, permanent financing and repayment risk, collateral risks (such as value and ability to foreclose), and the risk of a change in certain current laws that incentivize construction of clean energy facilities. In addition, expanding into this line of business presents overhead and startup costs that the business may not be able to support. Although we have previously had some experience in this business, we cannot be certain we have identified and adequately prepared for all of the risks associated with re-entering the business at this time.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, directly and indirectly affected by disruptions in credit markets.\nOur business was significantly affected by the disruptions in the credit markets during the global financial crisis. Disruptions in credit markets may cause significant deterioration in the market for tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other debt instruments that are a major part of our assets and likely to play a significant role in our reinvestment strategy. This has in the past and may in the future result in our having to reduce the carrying value of our bonds and other assets.\nVirtually all of our non-cash assets are illiquid and may be difficult to sell at their reported carrying values.\nOur bonds, our direct and indirect investments in real estate, and our other debt investments are illiquid and difficult to value. As to our bonds in particular, they are generally unenhanced and unrated and, as a consequence, the purchasers of our bonds are generally limited to accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers, which results in a limited trading market. This lack of liquidity complicates our ability to ascertain the fair value of our bonds and other debt investments as there is limited information on trades of comparable bonds and debt investments. Therefore, there is a risk that if we need to sell any of these assets, the price that we are able to realize may be lower than the carrying value.\nSome of our bonds are 30 or more days past due in principal and/or interest and others are at risk of becoming 30 or more days past due in principal and/or interest.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the aggregate unpaid principal balance (\u201cUPB\u201d) of bonds that were 30 or more days past due in either principal and/or interest was $67.0 million, or 19.8% of our total bond portfolio. We report our defaulted bonds at an estimated fair value which accounts for the default, but the values realized could be even less if foreclosures were pursued or if our borrowers filed for bankruptcy protection. Additionally, properties collateralizing certain performing bonds have net operating income (as represented in operating statements provided by the borrowing partnerships), which is less than the debt service owed to us. These bonds are at risk of default if the partners of the borrowing partnerships are unable or unwilling to continue to cover the shortfall in order to pay the full debt service.\nThe value of our tax-exempt investments could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws.\nThere is a risk that the government will pass legislation that could adversely affect the value of our tax-exempt bonds. The government could make changes in tax or other laws, such as affordable housing incentive programs that while not directly affecting our tax-exempt bonds, could make them less valuable to investors. For example, if the federal government were to lower marginal federal income tax rates, or phase out the tax-exempt nature of the interest income for all or higher income taxpayers, our bonds would likely decline in value. Congress could also pass laws that make competing investments more attractive than tax-exempt bonds, which would also make our bonds less valuable.\nOur bonds may not retain their tax-exempt status.\nOn the date of initial issuance of any tax-exempt bond that we hold, bond counsel or special tax counsel has rendered its opinion that interest on the bond is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, under certain circumstances, our bonds could lose their tax-exempt status subsequent to issuance. While we take steps to ensure that these circumstances do not occur, there can be no guarantees that the tax-exempt status will be maintained. If our bonds were to lose their tax-exempt status, then the fair value of those bonds would decline, and to the extent that the bond was the referenced asset in a TRS financing, the TRS would terminate causing us to reacquire the bonds at the then fair value plus any difference required to pay-off the related financing.\nExecuting TRSs are important to our US Operations.\nCurrently, our TRSs are with one financial institution. At least in the near term, entering into additional TRSs is a significant part of our US Operations. To the extent we are unable to execute these types of arrangements in the future we may not be able to achieve our near term goals and our financial position could suffer significantly.\nProposals pending in Congress could adversely affect the value of our investments in preferred stock or result in us having to post additional cash collateral for our preferred stock-related TRS.\nOur investments in preferred stock are comprised of stock investments in a private national mortgage lender and servicer. At December 31, 2014, these investments were carried at $31.4 million and the UPB and estimated fair value was $36.6 million. This lender originates and services multifamily loans for both the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d). There have been discussions and proposals in Congress to limit or eliminate the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US mortgage market. If these or similar proposals were to pass, the business of the mortgage lender in which we hold these investments, and therefore the value of our investments, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, these preferred stock investments are the reference assets in one of our TRS transactions, which had a $36.6 million notional amount at December 31, 2014. The counterparty to the transaction has the right to determine the value of the reference asset and to require us to post additional cash collateral if the value declines. If we are required to post additional cash collateral due to the deterioration in the value of the preferred stock investments, we would be unable to invest such cash at more than nominal interest rates while it serves as collateral, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could lose the tax benefit of our Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d).\nWe have significant deferred tax assets that are currently offset by a valuation allowance on our balance sheet. The most significant deferred tax asset is our federal NOL that can be used to offset federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. However, there are events that could cause us to lose or to otherwise limit the amount of NOLs available to us. For example, our NOLs could be lost if we suffer a change of control event as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. A change of control event may occur when a shareholder, or a collection of shareholders, owning at least five percent of our shares, acquire more than 50% of our outstanding shares within a three year period. As of this report, we have no known five percent shareholders; however, as a publicly traded company, we have limited recourse over the trading in our shares and five percent shareholders may exist in the future. In addition, our NOLs are subject to a 20-year carryforward limitation, thus limiting the time that we have to generate the income necessary to fully utilize our NOLs. It is possible that some of the NOLs will become permanently impaired if the Company is unable to generate the income required before their expiration period begins in 2027.\nIf we become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, we could be required to sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result.\nWe continuously monitor our activities to be sure we do not become subject to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We are exempt from the Investment Company Act because of an exemption for companies that are \u201cprimarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.\u201d Because of changes in the nature and number of companies relying on this exemption and because most of the guidance surrounding this exemption comes from \u201cno action\u201d letters issued by the SEC staff, the SEC on August 31, 2011 issued a concept release requesting comment directed to the scope and use of this exemption. We do not know what action the SEC may take in response to the comments that it receives. If we were regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to extensive regulation and restrictions. Among other things, we would not be able to incur borrowings. Therefore, if due to a change in our assets, a change in the value of particular assets, or a change in the statute or the SEC\u2019s interpretation of the statute, we were to become subject to the Investment Company Act, either we would have to restructure our assets so we would not be subject to that Act or we would have to change materially the way we do business. Any of those changes could require us to sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses of value as a result.\nWe have provided guarantees with respect to certain of the tax credit equity funds that we sponsored, and if we were to become obligated to perform on those guarantees our financial condition and results of operation could suffer.\nEven though we sold the general partner (\u201cGP\u201d) interests in our remaining guaranteed LIHTC Funds in 2014, we retained our guarantee of tax benefits and minimum returns on investment to the guaranteed LIHTC Funds\u2019 investors. Prior to 2014, we sold GP interests in certain other LIHTC Funds where we made other types of guarantees and we have indemnified the purchaser from investor claims related to those guarantees. We continue to be obligated on our guarantees to the investors (or purchasers) in these funds and we could be required to make substantial payments with regard to these guarantees. In order for the investors in the LIHTC Funds to benefit from low-income housing tax credits, the partnerships in which the LIHTC Funds invest must operate affordable housing properties in compliance with a number of requirements in the Code and the regulations under it. Failure to comply continuously with these requirements throughout a 15-year recapture period could result in loss of the right to those low-income housing tax credits, including recapture of credits that were already taken, potentially creating liability under our guarantees. If we were to become obligated to perform on these guarantees our financial condition and results of operation would be negatively impacted and the impact could be significant.\nThe value of our International Operations investments and cash flows could fluctuate with changes in the relative value of the dollar, euro and South African rand (\u201crand\u201d) as well as with changes in benchmark interest rates.\nThe net assets and operations of IHS are denominated in various currencies. In addition, our co-investments in the SAWHF and the IHS Residential Partners I are denominated in rand and the majority of our expected co-investment in the IHS Fund II will be denominated in rand. We do not hedge these foreign currency exposures and may experience losses as the value of our holdings in IHS, SAWHF, IHS Residential Partners I and IHS Fund II fluctuates with changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the dollar. In addition, the SAWHF borrows money in US dollars from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, resulting in the SAWHF itself having dollar to rand currency risk. The SAWHF also enters into contracts in an effort to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with its dollar denominated debt. These borrowings and hedges could adversely impact the SAWHF\u2019s results and the value of our investment. We expect IHS Fund II to have similar risks. Additionally because there are financing arrangements in place for the IHS managed funds as well as the properties in which the funds have invested, the cost associated with the financing arrangements will change as the respective benchmark interest rate changes. Furthermore, interest rates affect the availability of mortgage financing which is important for the successful disposition of the funds\u2019 investments. These interest rate changes could adversely impact the value of our International Operations investments and cash flows.\nThe value of International Operations investments and cash flows are dependent on the quality of the management of the underlying properties.\nThe performance of the properties in which the IHS managed funds have invested can be adversely impacted by the quality of the property management. To the extent property managers are not able to provide quality property management, the value of our investments and the cash flows from these investments will suffer.\nOur International Operations have foreign government risk and stability risk.\nForeign governments have different laws and policies than the US government. They may change their laws and policies in ways that harm or limit our operations. They may compete directly with us. They may nationalize our operations without fair compensation to us. They may enact laws that make it more difficult for foreign companies to do business, thereby giving local competitors an advantage. South Africa and other countries impose exchange controls that regulate how money enters and leaves the country. These laws could be changed in ways that are adverse to us. Our ability to anticipate, control or counteract these risks is very limited.\nForeign countries have social and economic stability risks that are different than the US. South Africa has experienced some social unrest in the past and if that were to continue our operations and investments there could be adversely affected.\nThe application of international tax regimes could substantially affect our after tax results from International Operations.\nIncome we earn abroad is subject to an entirely different set of tax risks than income we earn domestically. We are subject to the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we earn income, or through which our income must move in order for us to receive it in the US. International treaties also govern these tax consequences. If any of these laws or treaties changes, it could impact our projected after-tax results and the impact could be substantial.\nOur International Operations are subject to additional real estate risks as compared to our US Operations, including laws and customs related to real estate ownership and finance.\nThe SAWHF and IHS Residential Partners I invest in and IHS Fund II expects to invest in real estate in South Africa. While many of the risks are similar to investing in US real estate, there are legal and market differences that may result in higher risks, which may adversely impact our operations and our results. In addition, the IHS Fund II may invest in countries outside of South Africa. We have limited experience outside of South Africa and we might face additional risks which we have not identified and which we are not sufficiently prepared to address.\nOur International Operations include investments in for-sale units, meaning adverse conditions in the mortgage market could affect the value of those units.\nThe SAWHF investments include and IHS Fund II investments are expected to include for-sale units. If buyers have difficulty obtaining mortgages or other financing, unit sales and, therefore, the value of our interests in these ventures, could be adversely affected.\nWe are at risk of key employee turnover.\nWe are vulnerable to key talent turnover and our business operations could suffer if we were unable to find suitable replacements on a timely basis. This risk is higher because we are leanly staffed.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Shares\nOur Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) can issue an unlimited number of common or preferred shares, which could reduce our book value per common share and earnings per common share and the cash or other assets available for distribution per common share upon liquidation or otherwise.\nUnder our Operating Agreement, subject to NASDAQ Capital Market rules imposing some limitations on our ability to issue shares without shareholder approval, our Board can authorize, without any requirement of shareholder approval, the issuance of an unlimited number of common shares. Issuances of common shares could dilute the book value or the net income per common share or the cash per share available for distribution to common shareholders. Our Board can also authorize, without any requirement of shareholder approval other than those imposed by NASDAQ, the issuance of an unlimited number of shares with preferences over the common shares as to dividends, distributions on liquidation and other matters, other than voting. This could reduce the book value and net earnings that would be allocable to our common shares and the cash or other assets that are available for distribution to our common shareholders either periodically or upon our liquidation.\nProvisions of our Operating Agreement may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nOur Operating Agreement contains at least three groups of provisions that could have the effect of discouraging people from trying to acquire control of us. Those provisions are:\n\u00b7 If any person or group acquires 10% or more of our shares, that person or group cannot, with a very limited exception, (1) engage in a business combination with us (including an acquisition from us of more than 10% of our assets or more than 5% of our shares) within five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless our Board approved the business combination or approved the acquisition of a 10% or greater interest in us before it took place, or the business combination is approved by two-thirds of the members of our Board and holders of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest; or (2) engage in a business combination with us until more than five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless the business combination is recommended by our Board and approved by holders of 80% of our shares or of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest.\n\u00b7 If any person or group makes an acquisition of our shares that causes the person or group to be able to exercise one-fifth or more but less than one-third of all voting power of our shares, one-third or more but less than a majority of all voting power of our shares, or a majority or more of all voting power of our shares, the acquired shares will lose their voting power, except to the extent approved at a meeting by the vote of two-thirds of the shares not owned by the person or group, and we will have the right to redeem, for their fair market value, any of the acquired shares for which the shareholders do not approve voting rights.\n\u00b7 One third of our directors are elected each year to three-year terms. That could delay the time when someone who acquires voting control of us could elect a majority of our directors.\nThe above provisions could deprive our shareholders of opportunities that might be attractive to many of them.\nWe are thinly traded and thus our trading price may not reflect the value of our shares.\nAlthough we are traded on NASDAQ Capital Market, our shares are thinly traded and we do not have analysts actively tracking and publishing opinions on the Company and our stock. Accordingly, the trading price of our shares may not reflect their full intrinsic value.\nEfforts to protect our NOLs could depress our share price.\nOur NOLs could be lost if a shareholder, or collection of shareholders, owning at least five percent of our shares, acquire more than 50% of our outstanding shares within a three year period. Our Board is currently evaluating measures designed to prevent such a loss of NOLs, but such measures might not be totally effective. Moreover, because the available measures involve limiting the ability to acquire, or the value of acquiring, five percent, or more, of our shares, these measures could discourage an acquirer from purchasing our shares and therefore depress our share price.", "PERMNO": 83827, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "MMAC"}
