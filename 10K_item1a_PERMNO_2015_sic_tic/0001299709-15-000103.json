{"cik": "1299709", "company": "BofI Holding, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our performance.\nOur results of operations depend to a great extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. We are exposed to interest rate risk because our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not react uniformly or concurrently to changes in interest rates, as the two have different time periods for adjustment and can be tied to different measures of rates. Interest rates are sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the FRB. The monetary policies of the FRB, implemented through open market operations and regulation of the discount rate and reserve requirements, affect prevailing interest rates. Loan originations and repayment rates tend to increase with declining interest rates and decrease with rising interest rates. On the deposit side, increasing interest rates generally lead to interest rate increases on our deposit accounts. In recent years, the monetary policy of the FRB has been to reduce market interest rates to historical lows, but recently prevailing interest rates have begun to increase and the financial markets are anticipating a further increase in interest rates by the FRB. We manage the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities; however a large and relatively rapid increase in market interest rates would likely have an adverse impact on our net interest income and a decrease in our refinancing business and related fee income, and could cause an increase in delinquencies and non-performing loans in our adjustable-rate loans. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the value of our loans, investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets and our ability to realize gains on the sale or resolution of these assets\nA significant economic downturn could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income and consumer spending. While the national economy and most regions have improved since the financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent economic recession, we continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. A return or continuation of recessionary conditions or negative events in the housing markets, including significant and continuing home price declines and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, would adversely affect our mortgage and construction loans and result in increased asset write-downs. In addition, poor economic conditions, including continued high unemployment in the United States, have contributed to increased volatility in the financial and capital markets and diminished expectations for the U.S. economy. While we are continuing to take steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans, we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets. Declines in real estate values, an economic downturn or continued\nhigh unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe impact of changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is unknown.\nIn 2013, the FDIC, the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios which became effective for us on January 1, 2015. The final rule also refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements to be considered \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6.0%, which was increased from 4.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%, which was unchanged from the previous rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios to be considered \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum capital ratios: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (b) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (c) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019.\nIf an institution does not meet or exceed these minimum capital ratios it will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d ratios plus the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as a prohibition on the payment of dividends or on the repurchase shares if we were unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to restructure our business models or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes in asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers could result in modifications to our business strategy.\nPolicies and regulations enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may negatively impact our residential mortgage loan business and compliance risk.\nOur consumer business, including our mortgage and deposit businesses, may be adversely affected by the policies enacted or regulations adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) which under the Dodd-Frank Act has broad rulemaking authority over consumer financial products and services. For example, in January 2014 new federal regulations promulgated by the CFPB took effect which impact how we originate and service residential mortgage loans. Those regulations, among other things, require mortgage lenders to assess and document a borrower\u2019s ability to repay their mortgage loan. The regulations provide borrowers the ability to challenge foreclosures and sue for damages based on allegations that the lender failed to meet the standard for determining the borrower\u2019s ability to repay their loan. While the regulations include presumptions in favor of the lender based on certain loan underwriting criteria, it is uncertain how these presumptions will be construed and applied by courts in the event of litigation. The ultimate impact of these new regulations on the lender\u2019s enforcement of its loan documents in the event of a loan default, and the cost and expense of doing so, is uncertain, but may be significant. In addition, the secondary market demand for loans that do not fall within the presumptively safest category of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d as defined by the CFPB is uncertain. The 2014 regulations also require changes to certain loan servicing procedures and practices, which result in\nincreased foreclosure costs and longer foreclosure timelines in the event of loan default, and failure to comply with the new servicing rules may result in additional litigation and compliance risk. On November 20, 2014, the CFPB released its Final Integrated Disclosure Rule (\u201cRule\u201d) that became effective on August 1, 2015. Among other things, the new rule requires lenders to combine the initial Good Faith Estimate and Initial Truth in Lending (\u201cTIL\u201d) disclosures into a single new Loan Estimate disclosure and the HUD-1 and Final TIL disclosures into a single new Closing Disclosure. The definition of an application and timing requirements will also change, and a new Closing Disclosure waiting period has been added. These changes, along with other changes required by the Rule, will require significant systems modifications, process and procedures changes and training. Failure to comply with these new requirements may result in penalties for disclosure violations under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d) and the Truth In Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d).\nRisks Relating to Mortgage Loans and Mortgage-Backed Securities\nDeclining real estate values, particularly in California, could reduce the value of our loan portfolio and impair our profitability and financial condition.\nThe majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. At June 30, 2015, approximately 66.4% of our mortgage portfolio was secured by real estate located in California. In recent years, there has been significant volatility in real estate values in California and in some cases the collateral for our real estate loans has become less valuable. If real estate values decrease or more of our borrowers experience financial difficulties, we will experience increased charge-offs, as the proceeds resulting from foreclosure may be significantly lower than the amounts outstanding on such loans. In addition, declining real estate values frequently accompany periods of economic downturn or recession and increasing unemployment, all of which can lead to lower demand for mortgage loans of the types we originate. A decline of real estate values or decline of the credit position of our borrowers in California would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our mortgage loans are unseasoned and defaults on such loans would harm our business.\nAt June 30, 2015, our multifamily residential loans were $1,185.5 million or 28.2% of our mortgage loans and our commercial real estate loans were $61.4 million, or 1.5% of our mortgage loans. The payment on such loans is typically dependent on the cash flows generated by the projects, which are affected by the supply and demand for multifamily residential units and commercial property within the relative market. If the market for multifamily residential units and commercial property experiences a decline in demand, multifamily and commercial borrowers may suffer losses on their projects and be unable to repay their loans. If residential housing values were to decline and nationwide unemployment were to increase, we are likely to experience increases in the level of our non-performing loans and foreclosed and repossessed vehicles in future periods.\nWe could recognize other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, if economic and market conditions worsen.\nOur held-to-maturity securities had gross unrecognized losses of $12.7 million at June 30, 2015. We analyze securities held in our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods reducing future earnings.\nA decrease in the mortgage buying activity of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or a failure by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the last three fiscal years we have sold over $1,327.7 million of residential mortgage loans to the government sponsored entities GSE aggregators and, as of June 30, 2015, approximately 21.5% of our securities portfolio consisted of RMBS issued or guaranteed by the GSEs. Each GSE is currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as conservator. The United States government is contemplating structural changes to the GSEs, including consolidation and/or a reduction in the ability of GSEs to purchase mortgage loans or guarantee mortgage obligations. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or what associated changes (if any) may be made to the structure, mandate or overall business practices of either of the GSEs. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form and whether they will continue to meet their obligations with respect to their RMBS. A substantial reduction in mortgage purchasing activity by the GSEs could result in a material decrease in the availability of residential mortgage loans and the number of qualified borrowers, which in turn may lead to increased volatility in the residential housing market, including a decrease in demand for residential housing and a corresponding drop in the value\nof real property that secures current residential mortgage loans, as well as a significant increase in interest rates. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, which would result in a decrease in mortgage loan revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income. Any decision to change the structure, mandate or overall business practices of the GSEs and/or the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private mortgage loan markets, or any failure by the GSEs to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe occasionally purchase loans in bulk or \u201cpools.\u201d We may experience lower yields or losses on loan \u201cpools\u201d because the assumptions we use when purchasing loans in bulk may not prove correct.\nFrom time to time, we purchase real estate loans in bulk or \u201cpools.\u201d In the past 8 years we purchased real estate loans in pools totaling $577 million, some of which remain in our loan portfolio. When we determine the purchase price we are willing to pay to purchase loans in bulk, management makes certain assumptions about, among other things, how fast borrowers will prepay their loans, the real estate market and our ability to collect loans successfully and, if necessary, to dispose of any real estate that may be acquired through foreclosure. When we purchase loans in bulk, we perform certain due diligence procedures and we purchase the loans subject to customary limited indemnities. To the extent that our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the basis for those assumptions change (such as an unanticipated decline in the real estate market), the purchase price paid for \u201cpools\u201d of loans may prove to have been excessive, resulting in a lower yield or a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For example, in the past, we have purchased \u201cpools\u201d of loans at a premium and some of the loans were prepaid before we expected. Accordingly, we earned less interest income on the purchase than expected. Our success in growing through purchases of loan \u201cpools\u201d depends on our ability to price loan \u201cpools\u201d properly and on general economic conditions in the geographic areas where the underlying properties of our loans are located.\nAcquiring loans through bulk purchases may involve acquiring loans of a type or in geographic areas where management may not have substantial prior experience. We may be exposed to a greater risk of loss to the extent that bulk purchases contain such loans.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nOur pending transaction with H&R Block Bank may not close as anticipated.\nOn April 10, 2014, we announced that BofI Federal Bank has entered into a definitive Purchase and Assumption Agreement with H&R Block Bank, a federal savings bank (\u201cHRBB\u201d), and its parent company Block Financial LLC, pursuant to which the Bank agreed to purchase certain assets and assume all of the deposits of HRBB. In addition, we have agreed with HRBB to the terms of a Program Management Agreement (\u201cPMA\u201d) under which the Bank will provide certain H&R Block-branded financial services products to customers of H&R Block, Inc. (\u201cHRB\u201d). The closing of the pending transactions with HRBB is subject to customary closing conditions. If the customary closing conditions are not satisfied, the transaction with HRBB will likely not be consummated in its current form, or at all.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction with HRBB.\nThe success of our pending transaction with HRBB will depend upon, among other things, our ability to combine and integrate the assumed deposits, our ability to operate the PMA and HRB\u2019s desire and ability to offer financial services products to customers after the closing date. Our objectives with regard to executing the assumption of the deposits and managing our obligations under the PMA are subject to risks that operational and regulatory procedures may change. Under the terms of the PMA there are no minimum transaction levels and the number of transactions that are processed may be more or less than expected due to business changes by HRB, regulatory changes or changes due to competition for HRB\u2019s products. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives or if HRB limits, eliminates or fails to realize the expected volumes for one or more of the financial services products described in the PMA, the anticipated benefits of the transaction with HRBB may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIn addition, the transaction with HRBB will require substantial resources and effort from our management. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the transaction may disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in our standards, controls, procedures or policies. In addition, difficulties in integrating the functions following completion of the transaction could harm our reputation with customers.\nIf our allowance for loan losses, particularly in growing areas of lending such as C&I and specialty finance loans, is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings, capital adequacy and overall financial condition may suffer materially.\nOur loans are generally secured by multifamily and, to a lesser extent, commercial and single family real estate properties, each initially having a fair market value generally greater than the amount of the loan secured. Although our loans are typically secured, the risk of default, generally due to a borrower\u2019s inability to make scheduled payments on his or her loan, is an inherent risk of the banking business. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and our loss history. Defaults by borrowers could result in losses that exceed our loan loss reserves. We have originated or purchased many of our loans recently, so we do not have sufficient repayment experience to be certain whether the established allowance for loan losses is adequate. We may have to establish a larger allowance for loan losses in the future if, in our judgment, it becomes necessary. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses will increase our expenses and consequently may adversely affect our profitability, capital adequacy and overall financial condition.\nIn addition, we continue to increase our emphasis on non-residential lending, particularly in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending and specialty finance lending, and these types of loans are expected to comprise a larger portion of our originations and loan portfolio in future periods. To the extent that we fail to adequately address the risks associated with C&I and specialty finance lending, we may experience increases in levels of non-performing loans and be forced to take additional loan loss reserves, which would adversely affect our net interest income and capital levels and reduce our profitability. For further information about our C&I lending business, please refer to \u201cBusiness - Asset Origination and Fee Income Businesses - Commercial Real Estate Secured and Commercial Lending.\u201d\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments, include methodologies to value our securities, evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment and estimate our allowance for loan losses. These methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nWe may seek additional capital but it may not be available when it is needed and limit our ability to execute our strategic plan. In addition, raising additional equity capital would dilute existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests and may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. We may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, which could dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interests in the Company.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance on our ability to raise additional capital if needed or if it can be raised on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, raising equity capital will have a dilutive effect on the equity interests of our existing shareholders and may cause our stock price to decline.\nAccess to adequate funding cannot be assured.\nWe have significant sources of liquidity as a result of our federal thrift structure, including consumer deposits, brokered deposits, the FHLB, repurchase lending facilities, and the FRB discount window. We rely primarily upon consumer deposits and FHLB advances. Our ability to attract deposits could be negatively impacted by a public perception of our financial prospects or by increased deposit rates available at troubled institutions suffering from shortfalls in liquidity. The FHLB is subject to regulation and other factors beyond our control. These factors may adversely affect the availability and pricing of advances to members such as the Bank. Selected sources of liquidity may become unavailable to the Bank if it were to no longer be considered \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d\nOur inability to manage our growth or deploy assets profitably could harm our business and decrease our overall profitability, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur assets and deposit base have grown substantially in recent years, and we anticipate that we will continue to grow over time, perhaps significantly. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, including among other things: (i) improve existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls; (ii) maintain effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines; (iii) maintain sufficient levels of regulatory capital; and (iv) expand our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base. In addition, acquiring other banks, asset pools or deposits may involve risks such as exposure to potential asset quality issues, disruption to our normal business activities and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention due to integration and conversion efforts. If we are unable to manage growth effectively or execute integration efforts properly, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be able to sustain past levels of profitability as we grow, and our past levels of profitability should not be considered a guarantee or indicator of future success. If we are not able to maintain our levels of profitability by deploying growth in our deposits in profitable assets or investments, our net interest margin and overall level of profitability will decrease and our stock price may decline.\nWe face strong competition for customers and may not succeed in implementing our business strategy.\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to remain competitive. There is strong competition for customers from existing banks and other types of financial institutions, including those that use the Internet as a medium for banking transactions or as an advertising platform. Our competitors include large, publicly-traded, Internet-based banks, as well as smaller Internet-based banks; \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d banks, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online banking; and traditional banking institutions such as thrifts, finance companies, credit unions and mortgage banks. Some of these competitors have been in business for a long time and have name recognition and an established customer base. Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and personnel resources. In order to compete profitably, we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans and investments and increase the rates we offer on deposits, which actions may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo remain competitive, we believe we must successfully implement our business strategy. Our success depends on, among other things:\n\u2022\nHaving a large and increasing number of customers who use our bank for their banking needs;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel as our business grows;\n\u2022\nOur ability to secure additional capital as needed;\n\u2022\nThe relevance of our products and services to customer needs and demands and the rate at which we and our competitors introduce or modify new products and services;\n\u2022\nOur ability to offer products and services with fewer employees than competitors;\n\u2022\nThe satisfaction of our customers with our customer service;\n\u2022\nEase of use of our websites; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to provide a secure and stable technology platform for financial services that provides us with reliable and effective operational, financial and information systems.\nIf we are unable to implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe expect the rate of our revenue growth to decline and consequently anticipate downward pressure on our operating margins in the future.\nWe believe the rate of our revenue growth will, at some point, generally decline as a result of a number of factors, including the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and the continued maturity of the internet-based banking market. We believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business, including increased expenditures for attracting new customers and retaining existing customers.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our customer base.\nThe brand identities that we have developed will significantly contribute to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \u201cBofI Federal Bank\u201d brands (including our other trade styles and trade names such as apartmentbank.com) is critical to expanding our customer base. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry for our \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d competitors in the internet-based banking market. Our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance our \u201cBofI Federal Bank\u201d brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nA natural disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California, could harm our business.\nWe are based in San Diego, California, and approximately 66.4% of our mortgage loan portfolio was secured by real estate located in California at June 30, 2015. In addition, some of our computer systems that operate our internet websites and their back-up systems are located in San Diego, California. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and mudslides. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio, which is comprised substantially of real estate loans. Uninsured or under-insured disasters may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. California has also experienced energy shortages, which, if they recur, could impair the value of the real estate in those affected areas. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain standard business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in large part on the continuing efforts of a few individuals. If we are unable to retain these key personnel or attract, hire and retain others to oversee and manage our company, our business could suffer.\nOur success depends substantially on the skill and abilities of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Gregory Garrabrants, our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew J. Micheletti, and other employees that perform multiple functions that might otherwise be performed by separate individuals at larger banks. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key employees, whether through termination of employment, disability or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our ability to grow and manage our growth depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled executive, technical, managerial, sales, marketing, customer service and professional personnel. The implementation of our business plan and our future success will depend on such qualified personnel. Competition for such employees is intense, and there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Being an Internet-Based Company\nWe depend on third-party service providers for our core banking technology, and interruptions in or terminations of their services could materially impair the quality of our services.\nWe rely substantially upon third-party service providers for our core banking technology and to protect us from bank system failures or disruptions. This reliance may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of our operations. Our operations also depend upon our ability to replace a third-party service provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt operations or if an essential third-party service terminates. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement, our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from using our products and services.\nGenerally speaking, concerns have been expressed about whether internet-based products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information of our customers or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and results of operations. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are internet-based, the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing and will continue to increase. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our customers\u2019 data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we add more customers and expand the number of internet-based products and services we offer.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe have risks of systems failure and security risks, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft.\u201d\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us and others could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. This is true of both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunication failure or similar catastrophic events.\nAny damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations or security breaches such as hacking or identity theft could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of customers to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and, as a result, we could lose customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our customers. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to our website, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of customers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our customers to access the internet and our website. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers have the ability to take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customer access to our products and services by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to access our website or by charging fees to us or our customers to provide access to our website. Such interference could result in a loss of existing customers and/or increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90634, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "AX"}
