Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this Annual Report, including the financial statements. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic and resulting worldwide economic conditions could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry, including consideration of the timing of the development and distribution of an effective vaccine or treatments. Management has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of its operations, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of this Annual Report or these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market (the \u201cNASDAQ\u201d) delisted our securities from trading on its exchange, which may limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Class A common stock, warrants and units were listed on NASDAQ and were subsequently delisted. We cannot assure you that our securities will be listed on NASDAQ in the future.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and officers.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if we have sufficient funds or we consummate an initial business combination, which we were unable to do by the deadline in our Charter. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nWe may file a winding up petition or a winding up petition may be filed against us that is not dismissed, and in that case a liquidator may seek to recover the proceeds we distributed from the Trust Account and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby potentially exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nWe may file a winding up petition or a winding up petition may be filed against us that is not dismissed. Any distributions received by stockholders from the Trust Account could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a \u201cvoidable preference.\u201d As a result, a liquidator could seek to challenge the transaction and recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination, which we were unable to do by the deadline in our Charter.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we would need to ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment securities\u201d constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business would need to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete an initial business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nWe may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders, which could delay the opportunity for our stockholders to elect directors.\nWe may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of an initial business combination, which could delay the opportunity for our stockholders to elect directors. There is no requirement under the DGCL for us to hold annual or general meetings to elect directors. Until we hold an annual meeting of stockholders, public stockholders may not be afforded the opportunity to elect directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter, and thus a business combination is unlikely.\nThe past performance of CSL, Mr. Gould, Mr. Shivram and other members of our management team may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company.\nInformation regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, CSL and its affiliates, Mr. Gould, and Mr. Shivram is presented for informational purposes only. Past performance by CSL, Mr. Gould, Mr. Shivram and other members of our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of CSL\u2019s or, Mr. Gould\u2019s, Mr. Shivram\u2019s or other members of our management team\u2019s performance as indicative of our future performance of an investment in the company or the returns the company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. None of our officers or directors have had experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies in the past. Mr. Shivram resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of December 30, 2020, and remains a member of the board of directors of the Company. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter, and thus a business combination is unlikely.\nWe are dependent upon our officers and directors, and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors. In addition, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nThe holders of the Founder Shares control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nThe Founder Shares entitle the holders to elect all of our directors prior to an initial business combination. We were unable to complete a business combination by the deadline in our Charter, and thus a business combination is unlikely. Holders of Class A common stock will have no right to vote on the election of directors during such time. This provision of our Charter may only be amended by a resolution passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of our common stock entitled to vote on such amendment. As a result, holders of Class A common stock not have any influence over the election of directors prior to an initial business combination. Accordingly, holders of Founder Shares may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that holders of Class A common stock do not support, including amendments to our Charter and approval of major corporate transactions. If the holders of the Founder Shares purchase any additional common stock in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither the holders of the Founder Shares nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than in connection with funding our ongoing operations and expenses. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by the then-holders of the Founder Shares, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of a business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our Sponsor, because of its ownership position through the Founder Shares, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Exchange Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nSimilarly, as a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.", "PERMNO": 17156, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "STNL"}
