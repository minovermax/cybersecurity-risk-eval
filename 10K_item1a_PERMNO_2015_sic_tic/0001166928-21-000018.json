{"cik": "1166928", "company": "WEST BANCORPORATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWest Bancorporation\u2019s business is conducted almost exclusively through West Bank. West Bancorporation and West Bank are subject to many of the common risks that challenge publicly traded, regulated financial institutions. An investment in West Bancorporation\u2019s common stock is also subject to the following specific risks. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Credit Quality\nWe must effectively manage the credit risks of our loan portfolio.\nThe largest component of West Bank\u2019s income is interest received on loans. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. There are risks inherent in making loans, including risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties of the future value of collateral, and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. We attempt to reduce our credit risk through prudent loan application, underwriting and approval procedures, including internal loan reviews before and after proceeds have been disbursed, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries, and collateral and guarantee requirements. These procedures cannot, however, be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks, and we can make no guarantees concerning the strength of our loan portfolio.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nThe information that we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete, which may result in an increased risk of default and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, such as fraud. Moreover, such circumstances, including fraud, may become more likely to occur or be detected in periods of general economic uncertainty. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the risks of a counterparty. In addition, in cases where we have extended credit against collateral, we may find that we are under-secured, for example, as a result of sudden declines in market values that reduce the value of collateral or due to fraud with respect to such collateral. If such events or circumstances were to occur, it could result in potential loss of revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial loans, which involve risks specific to commercial borrowers.\nWest Bank\u2019s loan portfolio includes a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial lines of credit and commercial term loans. West Bank\u2019s typical commercial borrower is a small- or medium-sized, privately owned Iowa or Minnesota business entity. Commercial loans often have large balances, and repayment usually depends on the borrowers\u2019 successful business operations. Commercial loans also are generally not fully repaid over the loan period and thus may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. If the general economy turns downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans, and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. Also, when credit markets tighten due to adverse developments in specific markets or the general economy, opportunities for refinancing may become more expensive or unavailable, resulting in loan defaults.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values.\nCommercial real estate loans were a significant portion of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties.\nIf the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time of originating the loans, which could cause us to charge off all or a portion of the loans. This could lead to an increased provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe federal banking regulators have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the CRE Guidance, a financial institution that, like West Bank, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm non-residential properties, loans for construction, land development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300 percent or more of total capital. Based on these criteria, West Bank had concentrations of 80 percent and 464 percent, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The purpose of the CRE Guidance is to assist banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of commercial real estate concentrations. The CRE Guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight, strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, and risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. West Bank believes that its current risk management processes adequately address the regulatory guidance; however, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of the risk management processes on an ongoing basis.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate collateral securing our loans.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Under certain circumstances, we may take title to the real property collateral through foreclosure or other means. As the titleholder of the property, we may be responsible for environmental risks, such as hazardous materials, which attach to the property. For these reasons, prior to extending credit, we have an environmental risk assessment program to identify any known environmental risks associated with the real property that will secure our loans. In addition, we routinely inspect properties following the taking of title. When environmental risks are found, environmental laws and regulations may prescribe our approach to remediation. As a result, while we have ownership of a property, we may incur substantial expense and bear potential liability for any damages caused. The environmental risks may also materially reduce the property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the property. We also cannot guarantee that our environmental risk assessment will detect all environmental issues relating to a property, which could subject us to additional liability.\nRisks Related to Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level we believe adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; credit loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.\nDetermination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates and management\u2019s judgment of credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. Also, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in provisions will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FASB issued a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL), will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing for loan losses that are probable, and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and to greatly increase the types of data we will need to collect and analyze to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in our level of allowance for loan losses and could result in the need for additional capital.\nOur accounting policies and methods are the basis for how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure they comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and reflect management\u2019s judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances. The application of that chosen accounting policy or method might result in us reporting different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. If management\u2019s estimates or assumptions are incorrect, the Company may experience a material loss.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nIf a significant portion of any unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities were to become other than temporarily impaired with credit losses, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings, and our capital ratios would be adversely impacted.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of investment securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of those securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other than temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods and result in realized losses.\nWe analyze our investment securities quarterly to determine whether, in the opinion of management, any of the securities have OTTI. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities is determined to have OTTI and is credit-loss related, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made, and our capital ratios will be adversely impacted. Generally, a fixed income security is determined to have OTTI when it appears unlikely that we will receive all the principal and interest due in accordance with the original terms of the investment. In addition to credit losses, losses are recognized for a security with an unrealized loss if the Company has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before collection of the principal amount.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results and could increase the risk of fraud.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Management believes that our internal controls over financial reporting are currently effective. While management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future perceived issues, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business operations and stock price.\nRisks Related to Information Security and Business Interruption\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us, our customers or third-party vendors, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks.\nThere continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber-criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nInformation pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking and core deposit and loan recordkeeping systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of our customers. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or the confidential information of our customers, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems), or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems. Our third-party partners\u2019 inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our customers, loss of business or customers, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nFurthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, retention and safeguarding of customer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing and mobile and online banking. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it might be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. We also interact with and rely on retailers, for whom we process transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cybersecurity breaches described above, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate.\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nOther Risks Related to West Bank\u2019s Operations\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nWest Bank maintains liquidity primarily through customer deposits and other short-term funding sources, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), brokered CDs and purchased federal funds. If economic influences change so that we do not have access to short-term credit, or our depositors withdraw a substantial amount of their funds for other uses, West Bank might experience liquidity issues. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity. If this were to occur and additional debt is needed for liquidity purposes in the future, there can be no assurance that such debt would be available or, if available, would be on favorable terms. In such events, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our net interest income, or we may need to sell a portion of our investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in the Company or West Bank realizing losses. Although we believe West Bank\u2019s current sources of funds are adequate for its liquidity needs, there can be no assurance in this regard for the future.\nThe competition for banking and financial services in our market areas is high, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face strong competition in originating loans, seeking deposits and offering our other services. We compete in making loans, attracting deposits, and recruiting and retaining talented employees. The Des Moines metropolitan market area, in particular, has attracted many new financial institutions within the last two decades. We also compete with nonbank financial service providers, such as FinTech companies, many of which are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a result.\nCustomer loyalty can be influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially if those offerings are priced lower than our products. Some of our competitors may also be better able to attract customers because they provide products and services over a larger geographic area than we serve. This competitive climate can make it more difficult to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers, can lower the rate that we are able to charge on loans, and can affect our charges for other services. Our growth and profitability depend on our continued ability to compete effectively within our markets, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of customer deposits due to increased competition could increase our funding costs.\nWe rely on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce our net interest margin and net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, stockholders and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including employee misconduct, vendor nonperformance, cybersecurity breaches, compliance failures, litigation or governmental investigations, among other things. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about West Bank, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our business. Should any events or circumstances that could undermine our reputation occur, there can be no assurance that any lost revenue from customers opting to move their business to another institution and the additional costs and expenses that we may incur in addressing such issues would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various legal claims and litigation.\nWe are periodically involved in routine litigation incidental to our business. Regardless of whether these claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by these legal claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth.\nIn the future, we may decide to expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets through opportunistic acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions or related businesses or through the hiring of teams of bankers from other financial institutions that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business, or by opening new locations. To the extent that we undertake acquisitions or new office openings, we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expense relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our overall levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. To the extent we hire teams of bankers from other financial institutions, our salaries and employee benefits expense will likely increase, which may have an adverse effect on our net income, without any guarantee that the new lending team will be successful in generating new business. Other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and general disruption to our business.\nTo the extent that we grow through acquisitions or office openings, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage such growth. Acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks similar to those commonly associated with new office openings, but may also involve additional risks. These additional risks include potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired bank or related business, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire, and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire.\nMaintaining or increasing our market share may depend on lowering prices and the adoption of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and customer needs. There may be increased pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nThe loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers or key personnel could cause our business to suffer.\nMuch of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain senior management and key personnel experienced in banking and financial services who are very involved in the communities we currently serve. Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of relatively few individuals. In addition, our success depends in significant part upon our senior management\u2019s ability to develop and implement our business strategies. The loss of services of a few of our senior executive officers or key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, at least in the short term.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nEarnings in the banking industry, particularly the community bank segment, are substantially dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (investments and loans) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including government monetary and fiscal policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. If interest rates increase, banks will experience competitive pressures to increase rates paid on deposits. Depending on competitive pressures, such deposit rate increases may occur faster than increases in rates received on loans, which may reduce net interest income during the transition periods. Changes in interest rates could also influence our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our securities portfolio. Community banks, such as West Bank, rely more heavily than larger institutions on net interest income as a revenue source. Larger institutions generally have more diversified sources of noninterest income.\nOur business is subject to domestic and, to a lesser extent, international economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal on outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment, not only in the markets where we operate, but also in the states of Iowa and Minnesota, generally, in the United States as a whole, and internationally. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; uncertainty in U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs; natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; widespread disease or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors. Such unfavorable conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to an inability to raise capital, operational losses, or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected.\nThe Company and West Bank are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. The ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market conditions, and governmental activities, many of which are outside of our control, as well as on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, or on terms acceptable to us. Failure to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, the costs of funds, FDIC insurance costs, the ability to pay dividends on common stock and to make distributions on the junior subordinated debentures, the ability to make acquisitions, the ability to make certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, and the results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to an economic recession and had other severe effects on the U.S. economy and has disrupted our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely impacted certain industries in which our clients operate and impaired their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain but may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the United States and the world. The spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the U.S. economy at large, and small businesses in particular, and has disrupted our operations. The responses on the part of the U.S. and global governments and populations have created a recessionary environment, reduced economic activity and caused significant volatility in the global stock markets. We have experienced significant disruptions across our business due to these effects, which may in future periods lead to decreased earnings, significant loan defaults and slowdowns in our loan collections. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain but may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a decline in the businesses of certain of our clients, a decrease in consumer confidence, and an increase in unemployment. Continued disruptions to our clients\u2019 businesses could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, the value of loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations, and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. Although the U.S. government introduced, and may introduce in the future, programs designed to soften the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses or provide stimulus checks to individuals, our borrowers may still not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has impacted and likely will continue to impact the financial ability of businesses and consumers to borrow money, which would negatively impact loan volumes. Certain of our borrowers are in, or have exposure to, the hotel, retail, restaurant and movie theater industries and are located in areas that are, or were, quarantined or under stay-at-home orders. COVID-19 may also have an adverse effect on our commercial real estate portfolio, particularly with respect to real estate with exposure to these industries, and our consumer loan portfolios. As COVID-19 cases have surged in recent months, any new or prolonged quarantine or stay-at-home orders would have a negative adverse impact on these borrowers and their revenue streams, which consequently impacts their ability to meet their financial obligations to us and could result in loan defaults.\nThe ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our business will depend on many factors, primarily including the speed and extent of any recovery from the related economic recession. Among other things, this will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in our markets, the development, distribution and supply of vaccines, therapies and other public health initiatives to control the spread of the disease, the nature and size of federal economic stimulus and other governmental efforts, and the possibility of additional state lockdown or stay-at-home orders in our markets in response to surges in the number of COVID-19 cases.\nThe initial distribution of vaccines has been slow, and there may continue to be challenges with producing and distributing sufficient quantities of the vaccines. If the general public is unwilling or unable to access effective vaccines and therapies, this may also prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, new variants of COVID-19 may increase the spread or severity of COVID-19 and previously developed vaccines and therapies may not be as effective against new COVID-19 variants.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we may experience adverse financial consequences due to a number of other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the negative effect on earnings resulting from the Bank modifying loans and agreeing to loan payment deferrals due to the COVID-19 crisis;\n\u2022increased demand on our liquidity as we meet borrowers\u2019 needs, experience significant credit deterioration, and cover expenses related to our business continuity plan;\n\u2022the potential for reduced liquidity and its negative affect on our capital and leverage ratios;\n\u2022the modification of our business practices, including with respect to branch operations, employee travel, employee work locations, participation in meetings, events and conferences, and related changes for our vendors and other business partners;\n\u2022increases in federal and state taxes as a result of the effects of the pandemic and stimulus programs on governmental budgets;\n\u2022an increase in FDIC premiums if the agency experiences additional resolution costs relating to bank failures;\n\u2022increased cyber and payment fraud risk due to increased online and remote activity; and\n\u2022other operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices because of the pandemic and governmental actions to contain it.\nOverall, we believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 will be severe and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and result in significant losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would adversely and materially impact our earnings and capital. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nThe U.S. government and banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have taken a number of unprecedented actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which established a $2.0 trillion economic stimulus package, including cash payments to individuals, supplemental unemployment insurance benefits and a $349.0 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.0 billion in PPP funding and Congress is in the process of negotiating additional stimulus bills and other actions in response to COVID-19. In addition to implementing the programs contemplated by these acts, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a steady stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation:\n\u2022requiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning;\n\u2022adding pandemic scenarios to stress testing;\n\u2022encouraging bank use of capital conservation buffers and reserves in lending programs;\n\u2022permitting certain regulatory reporting extensions;\n\u2022reducing margin requirements on swaps;\n\u2022permitting certain otherwise prohibited investments in investment funds;\n\u2022issuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and\n\u2022providing credit under the CRA for certain pandemic-related loans, investments, and public service.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and the Federal Reserve has taken a number of actions in response. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve dramatically reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Federal Reserve reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income, net interest margin and profitability. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business activities as a result of new government and regulatory laws, policies, programs, and guidelines, as well as market reactions to such activities, remains uncertain but may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted banking and other financial activities in the areas in which we operate and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues for us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the ability of our employees and clients to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which we operate and could create widespread business continuity issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of an outbreak or escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in our market areas, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have a business continuity plan and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plan and safeguards will be effective. Further, we rely upon third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, the Company and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s customers or other parties regarding the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nThe CARES Act included a $349.0 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals could apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank participated as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposed us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. On April 24, 2020, an additional $310.0 billion in funding for PPP loans was authorized and such funds became available for PPP loans beginning on April 27, 2020. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.0 billion in PPP funding.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nSince the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP, or litigation from agents with respect to agent fees. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, it has been reported that many borrowers fraudulently obtained PPP loans through the program. We may be subject to regulatory and litigation risk if any of our PPP borrowers used fraudulent means to obtain a PPP loan.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, or if the borrower fraudulently obtained a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nRisks Related to the Supervision and Regulation of the Banking Industry and Government Policies\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. A more detailed description of the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us is contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K in the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than our stockholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\nAs a financial holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and undergo periodic examinations by our regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and financial holding companies. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nCurrent or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including our ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. In addition, political developments, including possible changes in law introduced by the Biden administration or the appointment of new personnel in regulatory agencies, add uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the options available to the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These monetary policy options are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The specific effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nOther Risks Related to the Banking Industry in General\nTechnology is changing rapidly and may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables banks to better serve customers. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively implement new technology. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer, or more quickly offer, additional or superior products that could put West Bank at a competitive disadvantage.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States and globally as a benchmark for various financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt and interest rate swaps. LIBOR is set based on interest information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or alternative benchmarks have performed in the past or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR.\nWe have investment securities available for sale, loans, derivative contracts and subordinated debentures with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR to alternative rates, such as SOFR, could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. In addition, any such transition could: (i) adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally; (ii) prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; (iii) result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and (iv) require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management process from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nRisks Related to West Bancorporation\u2019s Common Stock\nOur stock is relatively thinly traded.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume of our common stock is relatively small compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given time. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the relatively small trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall more than would be justified by the inherent worth of the Company. Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant amount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, presidential elections, international trade wars or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to the impact of these risk factors.\nIssuing additional common or preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and capital may not be available when needed.\nThe Company may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in order to raise capital at some date in the future to support continued growth, either internally generated or through acquisitions. Common shares have been and will be issued through the Company\u2019s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company\u2019s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, and, if approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the 2021 annual meeting, the Company\u2019s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, as grants of restricted stock units vest. As additional shares of common or preferred stock are issued, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted. The market price of our common stock might decline or fail to increase in response to issuing additional common or preferred stock. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, on acceptable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $20.6 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding that were issued to the Company\u2019s subsidiary trust, West Bancorporation Capital Trust I. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to the Company\u2019s shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities (TPS)) before any dividends can be paid on its common stock, and in the event of the Company\u2019s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the common stock. The Company has the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related TPS) for up to five years during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s ability to pay future distributions depends upon the earnings of West Bank and the issuance of dividends from West Bank to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations. Interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the TPS are classified as a \u201cdividend\u201d by the Federal Reserve supervisory policies and therefore are subject to applicable restrictions and approvals imposed by the Federal Reserve Board.\nWest Bancorporation, Inc. and Subsidiary\nThere can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments.\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our common stock, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends or that any dividends we do declare will be in any particular amount. The primary source of money to pay our dividends comes from dividends paid to the Company by West Bank. West Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and applicable regulations, which in some instances limit the amount that may be paid as dividends.", "PERMNO": 89425, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WTBA"}
