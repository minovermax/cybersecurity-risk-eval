RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and stock price. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, which, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our prospects.\nBiopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, and we have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. We have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in June 2016. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry.\nIn September 2020, we announced topline data from the EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial, which randomized 1,201 migraine subjects to one of two STS101 dose strengths or placebo. Although STS101 3.9 mg and 5.2 mg showed favorable numerical differences versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at two hours post-administration, these differences did not achieve statistical significance for either dosage strength. In March 2021, we announced an update to our development plan for STS101 that takes into account the findings from our detailed analyses of results and data from our EMERGE efficacy trial. Our updated development plan for STS101 included a Phase 1 trial, which we completed in June 2021, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of STS101 5.2 mg and two higher dose strengths, as well as the new pivotal SUMMIT Phase 3 efficacy trial that we initiated in June 2021, with topline results expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe have limited or no experience as a company conducting Phase 3 clinical trials, submitting applications for regulatory approvals, such as an NDA, or commercializing any products.\nWe have had significant operating losses since our inception. Our net losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $51.2 million and $47.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $141.7 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with the development of STS101 and general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nSTS101 will require substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for or receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales. In addition, we expect to continue to incur increasing costs associated with operating as a public company. We also do not yet have a sales organization or commercial infrastructure and, accordingly, we will incur significant expenses to establish a sales organization and associated commercial infrastructure in advance of generating any commercial product sales. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue to develop STS101 through clinical trials and regulatory submissions. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working\ncapital.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the clinical development of STS101. These expenditures will include costs associated with clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and supply, as well as commercializing STS101, if approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any clinical trial is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of STS101.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $95.8 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second half of 2023. However, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainty and potential local and/or global economic recession. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize STS101 or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties, and we do not know when, or if, either will occur. We may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of STS101.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope, timing, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials for STS101, including our ongoing SUMMIT Phase 3 efficacy, our ongoing ASCEND Phase 3 long-term safety trial and including in connection with any clinical program we may pursue in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe scope and costs of manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of building a sales force and associated commercial infrastructure in anticipation of commercializing STS101;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing associated with commercializing STS101, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nany product liability or other lawsuits related to STS101;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ongoing or planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of STS101;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe payment of royalty payments owed under our existing license agreement;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company; and\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of revenues generated by sales of STS101, if approved.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate clinical studies or other development activities for STS101; or\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our efforts to establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize STS101, or reduce our flexibility in developing or maintaining our sales and marketing strategy.\nWe also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or STS101 that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We do not expect to realize revenue from sales of STS101 in the foreseeable future, if at all, unless and until STS101 is clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully commercialized. To date, we have funded our operations through private placements of convertible preferred stock, a convertible promissory note, long-term debt, and common stock. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and currently intend to do so through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, including pursuant to the Sales Agreement we entered into with SVB Leerink LLC in October 2020 in connection with our at-the-market offering, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, is likely to involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities received any distribution of our corporate assets.\nOur business is entirely dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of STS101, our only product candidate under development.\nWe have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine, which has not been approved for sale or commercial use. Currently, STS101 is our only product candidate and we have not licensed, acquired, or invented any other product candidates for pre-clinical or clinical evaluation. This may make an investment in our company riskier than similar companies that have multiple product candidates in active development and that therefore may be able to better sustain a failure of a lead candidate. The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, will depend entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of STS101, which may never occur.\nAs we continue development of STS101, our research and development expenses may increase substantially, as we seek to advance STS101 through clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory approval, and prepare for commercialization of STS101, if approved. We may have inadequate financial or other resources to advance STS101 through the clinical trial process, depending on the requirements of the FDA. In addition, our clinical development program for STS101 may not lead to regulatory approval from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies if we fail to demonstrate in ongoing or future trials that STS101 is safe and effective, and we may therefore fail to commercialize STS101. The challenge of establishing STS101 as being safe and effective may be even more difficult given the failure of STS101 to demonstrate statistically significant effects as compared to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of our EMERGE trial. Even if approved, we may fail to obtain differentiated product labeling for STS101 as compared to other available dihydroergotamine mesylate, or DHE, products for migraine and, as a result, our commercial prospects may be impaired. Further, STS101 may not receive regulatory approval even if it is successful in planned and future clinical trials. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of STS101 would have a material and adverse impact on our business. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market STS101,\nour revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets or patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of STS101, even if approved.\nThe clinical and commercial success of STS101 may depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully address the issues that we believe resulted in the EMERGE trial not achieving statistical significance on the co-primary endpoints, including, but not limited to, the DHE under-delivery we observed;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the STS101 5.2 mg dose strength that we selected for our Phase 3 clinical trial program to demonstrate adequate efficacy, safety and tolerability in the ACSEND and SUMMIT Phase 3 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise any additional required capital on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ntimely completion of our clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully conduct and complete clinical studies in the COVID-19 pandemic environment, and to adequately control for any factors introduced by the pandemic that may potentially affect the outcomes of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwhether we are required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies beyond those planned to support approval of STS101;\n\u2022\nour ability to consistently manufacture STS101 on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nour ability, and the ability of any third parties with whom we contract, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities the safety, efficacy and acceptable risk-benefit profile of STS101;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects or other safety issues experienced with STS101;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that our third-party contractors achieve and maintain, compliance with our contractual obligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to STS101;\n\u2022\nthe differentiation of STS101 from other available DHE products and other acute treatments of migraine, and the willingness of physicians, operators of hospitals and clinics and patients to adopt and utilize STS101;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop a commercial strategy and thereafter commercialize STS101 in the United States and internationally, if approved for marketing, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans, private insurers, government payors (such as Medicare and Medicaid and similar foreign authorities) and other third-party payors for STS101;\n\u2022\npatients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket for STS101 in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u2022\nthe convenience of the administration of STS101;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, payors and patients of the benefits, safety and efficacy of STS101, if approved;\n\u2022\npatient demand for STS101, if approved;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to STS101; and\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference, intellectual property challenges or intellectual property infringement claims.\nThese factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause us to experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize STS101. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to successfully commercialize STS101. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of STS101 to continue our business or achieve profitability. In addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned clinical trials.\nWhile the scope of regulatory approval generally is similar in other countries, in order to obtain separate regulatory approval in other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy. Other countries also have their own regulations governing, among other things, requirements for nonclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial sales, as well as pricing and distribution of STS101, and we may be required to expend significant resources to obtain regulatory approval and to comply with ongoing regulations in these jurisdictions. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nSTS101 failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference as compared to placebo on either of the co-primary endpoints in our first pivotal efficacy trial.\nIn September 2020, we announced topline data from the EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial. Although topline data showed numerical differences in favor of STS101 3.9 mg and 5.2 mg versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at two hours post-administration, these differences did not achieve statistical significance for either dose strength. Both dose strengths of STS101 did, however, demonstrate significant effects on both freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom by three hours post-dose and later time points. Both STS101 dose strengths were well-tolerated in the EMERGE efficacy trial, with low adverse event rates and no serious adverse events reported.\nBased on our analyses and review of EMERGE efficacy trial results and other data, including preliminary results from the ongoing ASCEND safety trial, we believe we have identified and have taken steps in our updated development plan to address the key reasons that STS101 did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo on the co-primary endpoints at two hours post-administration in the EMERGE efficacy trial. Our analyses suggest a significant proportion of subjects in EMERGE who self-administered STS101 to treat their migraine attacks may not have achieved and sustained targeted DHE concentrations due to under-delivery of STS101. We believe we have addressed this under-delivery issue through a combination of introducing improved instructions for STS101 use and subject training in our clinical trials and by making several minor modifications to the second-generation STS101 delivery device to improve its performance. We also believe other factors contributed to a negative outcome in the\nEMERGE efficacy trial, and we believe we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate these issues in the ongoing SUMMIT efficacy trial through modifications to the trial design and conduct. However, these efforts may prove to be ineffective and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or plan to take will result in successful outcomes in our future clinical trials of STS101, including our ongoing SUMMIT efficacy trial, or be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval.\nIn addition, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize STS101 without conducting further clinical trials in addition to those trials that are ongoing or planned, and there can be no assurance that the results of any ongoing, planned or additional clinical trials will be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval or support successful commercialization. For example, in August 2021, we announced that we plan to enroll approximately 180 additional subjects in the ASCEND trial to ensure adequate exposures and safety are established with STS101 incorporating the second-generation delivery device. While adding these subjects is not expected to affect the overall STS101 development timeline, the FDA may require additional patients or additional studies to evaluate STS101 incorporating the second-generation delivery device.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and outbreak in the United States may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 virus pandemic, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and manufacturing activities, including:\n\u2022delays or difficulties in enrolling subjects in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022delays in the completion of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreduced ability to monitor and thereby ensure adequate quality and compliance in the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the commercialization of STS101;\n\u2022diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u2022interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, which may impact review and approval timelines;\n\u2022\ninterruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our investigational product from CMOs due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u2022\ninterruption of, or delays in completing manufacturing and manufacturing-related activities such as CMO qualification, production equipment manufacture, delivery and qualification, validation of manufacturing processes, manufacture and/or analytical characterization of our product candidate, completion of stability studies and/or manufacture of registration batches of our product candidate required for NDA submission; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our nonclinical studies, clinical trials and product candidate manufacturing activities, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people.\nIn addition, the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus may negatively impact the trading price of shares of our common stock and could further severely impact our ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis or at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with\nconfidence, such as the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, equipment and supply shortages, delays in shipping, delays in manufacturing and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nFurthermore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. On July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to restart certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business\nClinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and delays can occur for a variety of reasons outside of our control.\nClinical development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. For example, in September 2020, we announced topline data from the EMERGE trial. Although STS101 3.9 mg and 5.2 mg showed favorable numerical differences versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at two hours post-administration, these differences did not achieve statistical significance for either dosage strength. In addition, we may experience delays in initiating or completing our ongoing, planned, or future trials of STS101. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that studies or trials for STS101 will begin on time, not require redesign, enroll an adequate number of subjects on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to:\n\u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the providers of healthcare services, such as the healthcare clinics and institutions where we conduct our ongoing clinical trials and may conduct planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each trial site;\n\u2022\nrecruiting an adequate number of suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\nhaving subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\naddressing subject safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u2022\nobtaining sufficient quantities of STS101 for use in clinical trials from third-party suppliers on a timely basis.\nWe may experience numerous adverse or unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical studies and clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize STS101, including:\n\u2022\nwe may receive feedback from regulatory authorities that requires us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of STS101 may produce negative or inconclusive results (for example, in the EMERGE trial, STS101 did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo on pre-specified co-primary endpoints), and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon our development program for STS101;\n\u2022\nthe number of subjects required for clinical trials of STS101 may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nclinical trial participants may not comply with study protocol procedures and instructions;\n\u2022\nwe or our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, fail to maintain adequate quality controls, or be unable to produce sufficient product supply to conduct and complete clinical trials of STS101 in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe or our investigators might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of STS101 for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, a finding that STS101 has undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of STS101 may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe quality of STS101 or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of STS101 may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022\nregulators may revise the requirements for approving STS101, or such requirements may not be as we anticipate; and\n\u2022\nfuture collaborators may conduct clinical trials in ways they view as advantageous to them but that are sub-optimal for us.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of STS101 beyond those that we currently contemplate, including for purposes of demonstrating the potential efficacy of STS101, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of STS101 or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only moderately positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nincur unplanned costs;\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for STS101 or not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements, which could be expensive and time consuming; or\n\u2022\nhave the treatment removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we could do for STS101, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled subjects in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nPrincipal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or a regulatory authority concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of the marketing application we submit. Any such delay or rejection could prevent or delay us from commercializing STS101.\nIf any of our clinical trials of STS101 are unsuccessful, delayed or terminated, its commercial prospects may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues from sales of STS101 will be delayed or not realized at all. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials may increase our costs, slow down our STS101 development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of STS101. If STS101 generally proves to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, it would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for STS101 under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization of STS101 and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nWe as a company have not previously submitted an NDA or any other marketing application to the FDA or similar filings to comparable foreign regulatory authorities. An NDA or other similar regulatory filing requesting approval to market a product candidate must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, effective, pure and potent for each desired indication. The NDA or other similar regulatory filing must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market STS101 in the United States or in any foreign countries until it receives the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory\nauthorities of such jurisdictions.\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of STS101 for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that STS101 is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with our trial protocol or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of STS101 outweigh any safety or other perceived risks; the FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or specifications of STS101;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve our manufacturing processes and facilities or the facilities of third-party manufacturers upon which we rely; or\n\u2022\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of pharmaceutical products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory bodies\u2019 approval processes and are commercialized.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval from the FDA or applicable foreign agencies for STS101, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, which may be required after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve STS101 for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not approve it with the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for its successful commercialization.\nIn addition, because migraine affects adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) and children (6 to 11 years of age), pediatric studies are required under the Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. To address such requirements, we designed an initial pediatric study plan, or iPSP, consistent with the FDA guidance Migraine: Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment (February 2018). We are awaiting FDA final agreement with the iPSP and plan to initiate after completing development of STS101 for acute treatment of migraine in adults.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of STS101 and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nIf we encounter difficulties with patient enrollment or completion in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects who remain in the study until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including as a result of the availability of approved preventive and acute treatments for migraine. The enrollment of subjects depends on many additional factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe general willingness of subjects to enroll in the trial;\n\u2022\nthe sample size of the subjects required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of subjects to trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new therapies that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u2022\nthe clinical site\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nsubjects may elect not to participate in future trials of STS101 given STS101 did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo on pre-specified co-primary endpoints in the EMERGE trial; and\n\u2022\nclinical trial participants may not comply with study protocol procedures and instructions.\nOur clinical trials may also compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that seek to treat migraine, and this competition will reduce the number and types of subjects available to us, because some subjects who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we may conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of subjects who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial sites.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of STS101. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could significantly affect patient enrollment and completion in our ongoing and planned clinical trials to an extent that we have not anticipated. Although subjects in our EMERGE trial were generally able to complete their scheduled visits and we were able to collect the essential data from those visits, there can be no assurances that our experience with our ASCEND safety trial, our SUMMIT efficacy trial, or any planned or future clinical trials will be the same or similar or that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a significant impact on our ability to complete our ASCEND and SUMMIT clinical trials and enroll subjects in any planned or future clinical trials.\nSTS101 may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nThe results of our clinical trials may show that STS101 may cause undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accounting Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nAlthough STS101 has generally been well-tolerated in our clinical trials to date, with low adverse event rates reported, if unacceptable side effects arise in our ongoing ASCEND safety trial, our ongoing SUMMIT efficacy trial, or any other trials we may conduct in the future, we, the FDA, or the IRBs at the institutions in which our studies are conducted could suspend or terminate our clinical trials or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease clinical trials or deny approval of STS101 for its targeted indications.\nTreatment-related side effects in our clinical trials or in the use of approved DHE products could also affect patient recruitment or the ability or willingness of enrolled subjects to complete any of our clinical trials, and/or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, if undesirable side effects caused by other available DHE products or DHE products in development, the development and successful commercialization of STS101, if approved, could be negatively affected. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in STS101 (DHE) is contraindicated for patients with certain pre-existing conditions and the labels of approved DHE products warn against use by patients with cardiovascular risk factors. These contraindications and warnings could limit the use of STS101 following marketing approval, if approved, or cause undesirable side effects in patients who use STS101 despite these warnings. For example, we received a single report of a treatment-related serious adverse event in an ASCEND trial participant. This adverse event was consistent with a side effect described in prescribing information for DHE and other vasoconstrictive agents, such as triptans. The adverse event occurred following the subject\u2019s sixth use of study medication, and no further occurrences were reported with six subsequent uses of study medication by the subject. Investigation determined the subject\u2019s medical history, which the subject did not disclose to the trial site, included DHE contraindications and fulfilled key trial exclusion criteria that are disqualifying for trial participation. In addition, approved DHE products carry a \u201cblack box\u201d warning in their labels for a risk that the coadministration of DHE and certain other drugs, including specific antivirals and antibiotics, may result in elevated levels of DHE in the blood, potentially causing vasospasm that may result in inadequate blood flow to the extremities or the brain. Unless we can successfully demonstrate by conducting drug-drug interaction studies and potentially additional studies that the coadministration of DHE and certain other drugs does not result in drug-drug interactions, the FDA is likely to require the label for STS101, if approved, to include such warning, and this could result in STS101 not achieving its full commercial potential. Treatment-related side effects in our clinical trials or in the use of approved DHE products could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete any of our clinical trials or result in potential product liability claims.\nIf STS101 receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by STS101 or by other DHE products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of STS101;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall the STS101 or change the way it is administered to patients;\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the STS101 or the manufacturing processes for STS101 or any component thereof;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication similar to those that are currently included with the labels of DHE products;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nSTS101 may become less competitive; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and result in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially\nand adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nWe may be unable to rely on Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which could result in a longer development program and more costly trials than we anticipate.\nWe may not be able to seek FDA marketing approval of STS101 under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us, would allow any NDA we file with the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved DHE products. Under Section 505(b)(2), the development and approval of STS101 could potentially be expedited by decreasing the overall scope of work we must do ourselves so as to enable an STS101 NDA submission based on Phase 3 efficacy and/or safety trial data combined with a demonstration of pharmacokinetic comparability of STS101 to one or more approved DHE products (i.e., reference listed drugs). Although we believe both our Phase 1 trials have established the pharmacokinetic comparability of STS101 5.2 mg to DHE reference listed drugs, if we are unable to rely on Section 505(b)(2), the development program for STS101 would be longer than we expect, and we would also have to conduct more costly trials than we anticipate, which would harm our business.\nSTS101 is a drug-device combination product, which may result in additional regulatory risks.\nOur finished drug product and nasal delivery device will be regulated as a drug-device combination product. There may be additional regulatory risks for drug-device combination products. We may experience delays in obtaining regulatory approval of STS101 given the increased complexity of the review process when approval of the product and a delivery device is sought under a single marketing application. In the United States, each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a drug, biologic or device. The delivery system device will be subject to FDA device requirements regarding design, performance and validation as well as human factors testing, among other things. We implemented several minor modifications to the second-generation STS101 delivery device to improve its performance and we cannot be certain these changes will not result in additional regulatory risks. Delays in or failure of the studies conducted by us, or failure of our company, our collaborators, if any, or our third-party providers or suppliers to obtain or maintain regulatory approval could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval, and associated delays in STS101 reaching the market.\nInterim, \u201ctopline\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others\nmay not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure.\nIf the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nEven if STS101 obtains regulatory approval, it may fail to achieve broad market acceptance.\nEven if STS101 receives FDA or other regulatory approvals, its commercial success will depend significantly on the extent to which it is adopted, prescribed by physicians and used by patients. The degree of market acceptance of STS101, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of STS101 as compared to other available acute therapies for treatment of migraine;\n\u2022\npatient satisfaction with the results and administration of STS101 and overall treatment experience, including, the ease and convenience of administration of STS101;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which STS101 is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture and release adequate commercial supplies on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans, private insurers, government payors (such as Medicare and Medicaid) and other third-party payors for STS101;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment with STS101 in relation to alternative treatments and patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket for the product, if approved, in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe, effective and easy to administer treatment;\n\u2022\nphysician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available preventive and acute therapies for treatment of migraine;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of side effects;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for STS101, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication similar to those that are currently included with the labels of DHE products;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians, operators of hospitals and clinics and patients to utilize or adopt our product as a solution, particularly in light of STS101\u2019s failure to demonstrate statistically significant effectiveness in our EMERGE trial;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about STS101 or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\npatients\u2019 willingness to take a dry-powder intranasal medication;\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that STS101, if approved, will achieve broad market acceptance among physicians and patients. Any failure by STS101, if approved, to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face, and will continue to face, significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration for STS101, if approved. Most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to successfully compete.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same markets as STS101. For instance, companies actively marketing branded products or that have products in late-stage development for the acute treatment or prevention of migraine which may directly or indirectly compete with STS101 include, but are not limited to, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Abbvie, Biohaven, Lundbeck, Amgen, and a number of smaller companies, including Impel NeuroPharma, Axsome Therapeutics, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, and Zosano Pharma. As well, generic products for the acute treatment or prevention of migraine may directly or indirectly compete with STS101. We expect STS101 to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, price, extent of adverse side effects experienced and convenience of administration. One or more of our competitors may develop and commercialize competing products that incorporate technologies similar to our proprietary technologies earlier than us, obtain approvals for such products from the FDA more rapidly than us or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than STS101.\nThe market in which we will compete with STS101 is currently dominated by generic triptan products, and also includes other DHE products, newer oral migraine-specific acute treatments and preventive treatments. The majority of the prescriptions written for the acute treatment of migraine are for generic triptans. There are seven FDA-approved triptan molecules available in branded and branded generic/generic oral dose forms, and two of these molecules are also available in injectable and/or liquid nasal spray dose forms that may have faster onset of action than oral dose forms.\nWith respect to DHE products, we will compete with Bausch Health\u2019s Migranal and several generic versions thereof, which are DHE liquid nasal spray products, as well as branded and generic DHE injectable products. In addition, Impel NeuroPharma recently received FDA approval for and launched a DHE liquid nasal spray product, utilizing the same liquid formulation and container closure system as Migranal, but with a different propellant-powered, single-use delivery device. There can be no assurance that STS101 will be able to successfully compete against such products, if approved.\nWe also face competition from newer oral migraine-specific acute treatments that have been approved by FDA and commercially introduced in 2020 such as Eli Lilly\u2019s lasmiditan, a ditan, and two gepants, Abbvie\u2019s ubrogepant and Biohaven\u2019s rimegepant. Because lasmiditan, ubrogepant, and rimegepant are thought to act by mechanisms other than vasoconstriction, recommended use is not restricted to patients who do not have cardiovascular risk factors or disease, as is the case for triptan and ergot alkaloid products (including DHE) due to their vasoconstrictive actions. Although the labels for lasmiditan, ubrogepant and rimegepant do not limit use to patients without cardiovascular risk factors or disease, we believe these products have disadvantages. For example, lasmiditan has been reported to commonly cause central nervous system adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence and paresthesia, and the lasmiditan label includes warnings for driving impairment and operation of machinery for at least eight hours after taking a lasmiditan dose, central nervous system depression, serotonin syndrome, and medication overuse headache. Additionally, because lasmiditan has shown potential for abuse and dependence, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, has designated lasmiditan as a controlled substance; this designation imposes licensing and documentation requirements upon prescribers and as well restricts distribution. With ubrogepant and rimegepant, reported efficacy is modest in comparison with efficacy historically reported with\ntriptan and DHE products.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources and experience than we do. If we successfully obtain approval for STS101, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of STS101, the ease with which STS101 can be administered and the extent to which patients accept the nasal route of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for STS101, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than STS101. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing STS101. Such competitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. For additional information regarding our competition, see \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d\nThe successful commercialization of STS101 will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payors provide coverage, adequate reimbursement levels and implement pricing policies favorable for it. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for STS101, if approved, could limit our ability to market our product and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability of coverage and adequacy of reimbursement by managed care plans, governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford medical services and pharmaceutical products that receive FDA approval. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for STS101 by third-party payors will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize it. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for STS101, could reduce physician utilization if approved. Assuming there is coverage for STS101 by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available for STS101 and any reimbursement that may become available may not be adequate or may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and other third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs have resulted in increasing challenges to prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent generic drug, biosimilar or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider STS101 as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product, if any. For example, there are currently generic versions of both DHE liquid nasal spray products and DHE injectable products, with which we may compete. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with STS101, pricing of existing third-party therapeutics may limit the amount we will be able to charge for it. These third-party payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of STS101, if approved, or establish prices for it at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize STS101.\nNo uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of STS101 to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries will likely put pressure on the pricing and usage of medical products. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems.\nOther countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for STS101. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for STS101 may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially-reasonable revenue and profits.\nWe currently have no sales organization. If we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell STS101 effectively in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales organization. In order to commercialize STS101, if approved, in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If STS101 receives regulatory approval, we expect to establish a sales organization in the United States with technical expertise and supporting marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize it, which will be expensive and time consuming. We have no prior experience as a company in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain, and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of STS101. We may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize STS101. If we are not successful in commercializing STS101, either on our own or through arrangements with one or more third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and we would incur significant additional losses.\nWe rely, and intend to continue to rely, on qualified third parties to supply all components of STS101. As a result, we are dependent on several third parties, most of which are sole source suppliers, for the manufacture of STS101 and our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any of these suppliers, or they fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to supply sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, it would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial manufacture of either the proprietary dry-powder formulation of DHE component of STS101 or the proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device, including the drug substance and packaging. We have limited personnel with experience in drug-device product manufacturing and we lack the capabilities to manufacture either the drug or device components of STS101 on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently outsource all manufacturing and packaging of STS101 to third parties, and we do not plan to own or operate our own manufacturing and packaging facilities. There can be no assurance that our clinical development product supplies will not be limited, interrupted, or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. In particular, any replacement of any of our third-party suppliers could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements. In addition, we may encounter issues with transferring technology to a new third-party manufacturer, and we may encounter regulatory delays if we need to move the manufacturing of our products from one third-party manufacturer to another. Some of the third parties on which we rely may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies, and the foregoing challenges could be compounded as a result.\nIn addition, we do not currently have long-term commercial supply agreements with third-party manufacturers for either the formulation or device components of STS101 or the STS101 finished product. We may be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with all third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we enter into these agreements or, for those agreements that we have already entered into, the various manufacturers utilized for STS101 will likely be single source suppliers to us for a significant period of time. We may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for STS101 prior to commercialization. Certain of such suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements covering manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to STS101, and are subject to pre-approval and ongoing inspections by the regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to\nour manufacturing capacity while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured STS101 ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third parties for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and hazardous materials handling;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing and quality agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to any manufacturers with which we do not have a long-term agreement, the possibility that the manufacturer decides to stop supplying to us or changes the price or other terms of supply.\nAny of these factors could cause the delay of required approvals or commercialization of STS101, could prevent us from commercializing it successfully, could cause the suspension of initiation or completion of clinical trials and regulatory submissions, and could lead to higher product costs.\nIn addition, the facilities used by our CMOs to manufacture STS101 are subject to various regulatory requirements and may be subject to the inspection of the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We do not directly control manufacturing at our CMOs, and are completely dependent on them for compliance with current regulatory requirements. If our CMOs cannot successfully manufacture components of finished product that conforms to our specifications and the regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions, we may not be able to rely on them for the manufacture of STS101. In addition, we have limited control over the ability of our CMOs to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority finds our facilities or those of our CMOs inadequate for the manufacture of STS101 or if such facilities are subject to enforcement action in the future or are otherwise inadequate, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize STS101 and the timing of any such approval and commercialization. We implemented several minor modifications to the STS101 delivery device to improve its performance and we cannot be certain these changes will not result in additional regulatory risks. In addition, if any of our CMOs are adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies, or if such events impede the ability of the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority to inspect the facilities used by our CMOs to manufacture STS101, which could delay our ability to seek approval or commercialize STS101.\nOur CMOs may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments.\nAdditionally, due to COVID-19 pandemic we may experience interruption of, or delays in completing manufacturing and manufacturing-related activities such as CMO qualification, production equipment manufacture, delivery and qualification, validation of manufacturing processes, manufacture and/or analytical characterization of our product candidate, completion of stability studies and/or manufacture of registration batches of our product candidate required for NDA submission. If our CMOs were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide STS101 to subjects in clinical trials, or to provide product for the treatment of patients once approved, would be jeopardized.\nWe rely, and intend to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of STS101, and the loss of third-party suppliers or their inability to supply us with adequate key materials could harm our business.\nWe currently do not have the ability to independently conduct any clinical trials. We rely, and intend to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers, most of which are sole source suppliers, for certain key materials required\nfor the production of the DHE dry-powder formulation of STS101. Our dependence on these third-party suppliers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of these materials involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. As a small company, our negotiation leverage is limited and we are likely to get lower priority than other companies or purchasers that are larger than we are. We cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these key materials that we require or satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Some of these third parties may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies. Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced key materials could materially harm the manufacture of STS101 until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and potential commercialization of STS101, including limiting supplies necessary for clinical trials and regulatory approvals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely, and intend to continue to rely, on third parties in the conduct of all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for STS101.\nThe FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs and consultants, to conduct GCP-compliant clinical trials of STS101 properly and on time. While we have agreements with these third parties, we monitor and control only certain aspects of their activities and have limited influence over their actual performance and the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct portions of our clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. These challenges have been made more difficult by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shelter-in-place and stay-at-home restrictions, which are driving greater dependency on electronic monitoring of our clinical trial sites. Such monitoring could prove to be less reliable and could increase data privacy and cybersecurity risks.\nIf the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not adequately perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience significant business challenges, disruptions or failures, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our protocols or to GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated. As a result, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for STS101, our results our business and results of operations and the commercial prospects for STS101 would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 21 full-time employees. We will need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and commercialize STS101. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we:\n\u2022\neffectively manage our clinical trials and the development of STS101;\n\u2022\nidentify, recruit, retain, incentivize and integrate additional employees, including sales personnel;\n\u2022\nmanage our internal development and operational efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to third parties; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement these tasks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and stock price.\nWe may conduct additional clinical trials and consider additional headache indications for STS101 to enhance its commercial potential; however, these trials may not produce results necessary to enable additional commercial potential or enhancement of its label.\nIn addition to our pursuit of initial regulatory approval and successful commercialization of STS101 in the United States, we may conduct additional clinical trials and consider additional headache indications for STS101 to expand its commercial potential, including by potentially conducting clinical programs outside the United States. However, any positive results from our ongoing, planned or future clinical trials of STS101 and results from clinical testing by third parties of other DHE products and product candidates, may not be predictive of the results of any such additional clinical trials. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will ever be successful enhancing the commercial potential of STS101 or expanding its label.\nAny future collaboration arrangements that we may enter into, may not be successful, which could significantly limit the likelihood of receiving the potential economic benefits of the collaboration and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize STS101.\n\u2022\nTo the extent that we pursue collaborations relating to STS101 in the future, we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and may not be able to ultimately enter into collaborations. Moreover, any such collaboration arrangements may be complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and maintain and challenging to manage. We may not be successful in our efforts with any such collaborator and we may never receive any milestone or royalty payments under any such agreements. Further, the terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish, may not be favorable to us.\n\u2022\nThe success of any collaboration arrangement will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include risks that:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of STS101 or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to their acquisition of competitive products or their internal development of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with STS101;\n\u2022\nwe could grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened\nlitigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated, and, if terminated, this may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of STS101;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaborations;\n\u2022\na collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws, resulting in civil or criminal proceedings;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that causes the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of STS101 or that results in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborators may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent and unforeseen liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nassimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u2022\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nour inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do\nbusiness.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of STS101 and other hazardous compounds. We and any third-party manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air and water; and employee health and safety. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products.\nAlthough we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, product development and manufacturing efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes..\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We generally seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses that are important to our business. Our patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, patents issue from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology in appropriate jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found invalid or unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. For example, we do not have a patent covering the composition of matter for DHE, the active ingredient in STS101. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use STS101 and proprietary technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have applied, and we intend to continue applying, for patents covering aspects of STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses that we deem appropriate. However, we may not be able to apply for patents on certain aspects of STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses in a timely fashion, at a reasonable cost, in all jurisdictions, or at all, and any potential patent coverage we obtain may not be sufficient to prevent substantial competition.\nWe own or have an exclusive license under more than sixty U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications. In the U.S., we own or have exclusive license rights under 10 issued U.S. patents relating to STS101 that have expiration dates (absent any adjustments or extensions of term) as late as 2039. We believe the breadth of our patent estate reflects the highly innovative and differentiated nature of our proprietary dry-powder nasal delivery and formulation technologies. With the exception of one issued U.S. patent and several issued or allowed patents in the European Union and Japan that we own, all of our rights under issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to STS101 are exclusively licensed from SNBL.\nWe cannot be certain that the claims in any of our patent applications will be considered patentable by the USPTO, courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in issued patents relating to STS101 will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our actual or potential future collaborators will be successful in protecting STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process, the noncompliance with which can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, and partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction;\n\u2022\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u2022\npatents owned or in-licensed by us may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nour competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already filed for or obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell STS101;\n\u2022\nother parties may have designed around our claims or developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our platform, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same compositions, methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position;\n\u2022\nany successful opposition or other post-grant challenges to any patents owned by or licensed to us could result in revocation or amendment to our patents so that they no longer cover STS101;\n\u2022\nbecause patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses;\n\u2022\nan interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications for any application with an effective filing date before March 16, 2013;\n\u2022\nthere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u2022\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. Moreover, the patent prosecution process is also expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific\ncollaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach such agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents, if issued, or the patent rights that we license from others, may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Once granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of STS101. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components or methods that are used in connection with their products and services. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product or service. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us or licensor Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd., or SNBL, which we have agreed to indemnify under certain circumstances, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering STS101 are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered STS101, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights. If we initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third-party claims, such proceedings would be expensive and would divert the attention of our management and technical personnel.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nany of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, or those of our licensors, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect STS101;\n\u2022\nany of our pending patent applications or those of our licensors may issue as patents;\n\u2022\nothers will not or may not be able to make, use, offer to sell, or sell products that are the same as or similar to our own but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\u2022\nwe will be able to successfully commercialize STS101 on a substantial scale, if approved, before the relevant patents that we own or license expire;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the patents and pending patent applications that we own or license;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe the patents we own or license;\n\u2022\nany of the patents we own or license will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our licensors will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u2022\na third party may not challenge the patents we own or license and, if challenged, a court would hold that such patents are valid, enforceable and infringed;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nour competitors do not conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have enforceable patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or\n\u2022\nour commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nTo the extent we obtain licenses from or collaborate with third parties, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties, or such activities, if controlled by us, may require the input of such third parties. We may also require the cooperation of our licensors and collaborators to enforce any licensed patent rights, and such cooperation may not be provided. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Moreover, if we do obtain necessary licenses, we will likely have obligations under those licenses, and any failure to satisfy those obligations could give our licensor the right to terminate the license. Termination of a necessary license, or expiration of licensed patents or patent applications, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe lives of our patents may not be sufficient to effectively protect STS101 and our business.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective non-provisional filing date. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition. In addition, although upon issuance in the United States a patent\u2019s life can be increased based on certain delays caused by the USPTO, this increase can be reduced or eliminated based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant during patent prosecution. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of STS101, patents protecting it might expire before or shortly after it is commercialized. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect STS101, proprietary technologies and their uses, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely on the protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information. We have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, such security measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary information, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee, consultant, customer or third party with authorized access. Our security measures may not prevent an employee, consultant or customer from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of STS101 that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Even though we use commonly accepted security measures, the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, third parties may still obtain this information or may\ncome upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. Trade secrets will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from company to company or academic to industry scientific positions. Though our agreements with third parties typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, collaborators, licensors, suppliers, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Because from time to time we expect to rely on third parties in the development, manufacture, and distribution of STS101, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. Despite employing the contractual and other security precautions described above, the need to share trade secrets increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets, the value of this information may be greatly reduced and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize STS101 are subject in part to the terms and conditions of a license granted to us by SNBL. The patent protection, prosecution and enforcement for STS101 may be dependent on third parties.\nWe currently are reliant upon a license of certain patent rights and proprietary technology pursuant to a licensing and assignment agreement we entered with SNBL in June 2016, or the SNBL License. Such rights and technology are important or necessary to the development of STS101. This and other licenses we may enter into in the future may not provide adequate rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use or in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future. As a result, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our technology and products in fields of use and territories for which we are not granted rights pursuant to such licenses.\nLicenses to additional third-party technology that may be required for our development programs may not be available in the future or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution and enforcement of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In addition, in some instances, the SNBL License requires us to negotiate in good faith a strategy with respect to infringement, and in some instances, SNBL retains the sole right to initiate and control some infringing activities, before we can enforce patent rights. Therefore, we cannot be certain that SNBL or any future licensors or collaborators will prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend such intellectual property rights in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business, including by taking reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of know-how and trade secrets, or by paying all applicable prosecution and maintenance fees related to intellectual property registrations for STS101. We also cannot be certain that our licensors have drafted or prosecuted the patents and patent applications licensed to us in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which may affect the validity and enforceability of such patents or any patents that may issue from such applications. If they fail to do so, this could cause us to lose rights in any applicable intellectual property that we in-license, and as a result our ability to develop and commercialize STS101 may be adversely affected and we may be unable to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nThe SNBL License imposes a low single-digit royalty on net sales of STS101 along with certain other obligations on us, and any future licenses, if required, likely will impose various royalty payments, milestones, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from developing and commercializing STS101 and proprietary technologies. Our business would suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to enforce licensed patents against infringing third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable\nterms. Furthermore, if any current or future licenses terminate, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties may gain the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize STS101, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. Claims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts. We cannot assure you that our operations do not, or will not in the future, infringe existing or future patents.\nOther entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import STS101 or impair our competitive position. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, reexaminations, inter partes review proceedings and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO and/or corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous third-party U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications exist in the fields of STS101. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of STS101.\nFurthermore, the scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent\u2019s prosecution history and can involve other factors such as expert opinion. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of claims in a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market STS101. Further, we may incorrectly determine that our technologies or STS101 are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party\u2019s pending patent application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market STS101.\nAs the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that STS101 may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell STS101. We do not always conduct independent reviews of pending patent applications of and patents issued to third parties.\nPatent applications in the United States and elsewhere are typically published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Certain U.S. applications that will not be filed outside the United States can remain confidential until patents issue. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived. Furthermore, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, STS101 or the use of STS101. As such, there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell STS101. Because patent applications are maintained as confidential for a certain period of time, until the relevant application is published we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by\ncommercialization of STS101, and cannot be certain that we were the first to file a patent application related to a product candidate or technology. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently-pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that STS101 may infringe. In addition, identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could:\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u2022\ncause development delays;\n\u2022\nprevent us from commercializing STS101 until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u2022\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing, which may include treble damages if we are found to have been willfully infringing such intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; and/or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAlthough no third-party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this report, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent STS101 from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to STS101 or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages, including treble damages if we were determined to willfully infringe, and require us to obtain a license to manufacture or market STS101. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if such licenses are available, we could incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins, and the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. In addition, we cannot be certain that we could redesign STS101 or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing STS101, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity and could prohibit us from marketing or otherwise commercializing STS101.\nIf we collaborate with third parties in the development of technology in the future, our collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability. Further, collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability. Also, we may be obligated under our agreements with our collaborators, licensors, suppliers and others to indemnify and hold them harmless for damages arising from intellectual property infringement by us.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful. Further, issued patents relating to STS101 could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors. To prevent infringement or\nunauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we own or in-license is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed. If we or any of our potential future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent directed at STS101, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. Similar mechanisms for challenging the validity and enforceability of a patent exist in ex-U.S. patent offices and may result in the revocation, cancellation, or amendment of any ex-U.S. patents we hold in the future. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable, and prior art could render our patents or those of our licensors invalid. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development or manufacturing partnerships that would help us bring STS101 to market.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may fail to comply with our obligations under the SNBL License or any future agreements pursuant to which we may license or otherwise acquire intellectual property rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nOur business is dependent on the SNBL License for certain patent rights and know-how that are directed to SNBL\u2019s proprietary nasal drug delivery technology, including its proprietary nasal delivery device and formulation technologies, for use with DHE. Our rights under the SNBL License and any license for intellectual property or technology that we may enter into in the future are and will be subject to the continuation of and our compliance with the terms of these agreements. Disputes may arise regarding our rights to intellectual property licensed to us from a third party, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the creation or use of intellectual property by us, alone or with our licensors and collaborators;\n\u2022\nthe scope and duration of our payment obligations;\n\u2022\nour rights upon termination of such agreement; and\n\u2022\nthe scope and duration of exclusivity obligations of each party to the agreement.\nAny disputes over intellectual property and other rights under the SNBL License could prevent or impair our ability to maintain the license on acceptable terms and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize STS101. In addition, if we fail to comply with our obligations under the SNBL License, it may be terminated or the scope of our rights under it may be reduced and we might be unable to develop, manufacture or market STS101.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distraction to management and other employees.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for STS101, STS101 will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nIf STS101 is approved, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post- market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any approved marketing application. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control.\nWe will have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for STS101. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote STS101 for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product\u2019s FDA approved labeling. We also must submit new or\nsupplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to STS101, if approved, product labeling, or manufacturing process. We could also be asked to conduct post-marketing clinical studies to verify the safety and efficacy of STS101 in general or in specific patient subsets. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nIf we discover previously unknown problems with STS101, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where STS101 is manufactured, or if the FDA disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of STS101, the FDA may impose restrictions on it or us, including requiring withdrawal of it from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical studies;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nrequire a product recall, seizure or detention.\nAny government action or investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from STS101. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nMoreover, the policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of STS101. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. In addition, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we could lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf STS101 obtains regulatory approval, competitors could enter the market with generic versions, which may result in a material decline in sales of affected products.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of an approved drug product. A manufacturer may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which may be for a new or improved version of the originally approved drug product. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA acceptance or approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for specific timeframes. In addition to this non-patent exclusivity, an NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed in the FDA publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d known as the Orange Book. If there are patents listed in the Orange Book for a product, a generic or 505(b)(2) applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents must include in their applications what is known as a \u201cParagraph IV\u201d certification, challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given to the patent owner and NDA holder and if, within 45 days of receiving notice, either the patent owner or NDA holder sues for patent infringement, approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA is stayed for up to 30 months.\nAccordingly, if STS101 is approved, including through the 505(b)(2) pathway, competitors could file ANDAs for generic versions of STS101. If there are patents listed for STS101 in the Orange Book, those ANDAs would be\nrequired to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating whether the ANDA applicant does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict which, if any, patents in our current portfolio or patents we may obtain in the future will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would address such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents, or the outcome of any such suit.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for STS101. Moreover, if any of our owned or in-licensed patents that are listed in the Orange Book are successfully challenged by way of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent litigation, STS101 could immediately face generic competition and its sales would likely decline rapidly and materially.\nThe successful commercialization of STS101 will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers, managed care plans and other third-party payors provide coverage, adequate reimbursement levels and implement pricing policies favorable for STS101. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for STS101, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability of coverage and adequacy of reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, managed care plans and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford medical services and pharmaceutical products such as STS101 that receive FDA approval. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors for our products will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize STS101.\nNo uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor\u2019s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product that we may develop. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover STS101 could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAssuming there is coverage for our products by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely. Third-party payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for particular drugs or biologics when an equivalent generic drug, biosimilar or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider STS101 as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product. For example, there are currently generic versions of both DHE liquid nasal spray products and DHE injectable products, which we may compete with. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with STS101, pricing of other third-party therapeutics may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our products. These third-party payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of our products, if approved, or establish prices for our products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. If reimbursement is not available, is decreased or eliminated in the future, or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our products.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in\nEurope and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our products, if any. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our products. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nOur business operations and current and future relationships with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute STS101, if approved. Such laws include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under any U.S. federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal civil monetary penalty and civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. Pharmaceutical manufacturers can cause false claims to be presented to the U.S. federal government by engaging in impermissible marketing practices, such as the off-label promotion of a product for an indication for which it has not received FDA approval. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022\nanalogous U.S. state laws, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits, among other things, U.S. companies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international organizations and foreign government owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign political office, and foreign political parties or officials thereof; and\n\u2022\nsimilar healthcare and data protection laws in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment, which could affect our ability to operate our business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nEnacted and future healthcare legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize STS101 and may affect the prices we may set.\nIn the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payors. Among the provisions of the ACA, those of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries include the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, non-deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents (other than those designated as orphan drugs), which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nan increase to the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and an extension the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care\norganizations;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n\u2022\nestablishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which includes a provision that entered into effect on January 1, 2019, that repeals the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the ACA that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress.\nMoreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under government payor programs, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. The likelihood of success of these and other measures initiated by the former Trump administration is unclear, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for STS101 or additional pricing pressures.\nIndividual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize STS101, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most European Union member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing European Union and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of STS101, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize STS101, if approved. In markets outside of the United States and European Union, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States, the European Union or any other jurisdiction. For example, the results of the 2020 presidential election may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these executive actions will be implemented, or whether they will be rescinded and replaced under the Biden administration. The policies and priorities of a new administration and unknown and could materially impact the regulations governing our product candidates. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, STS101 may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nChanges in and failures to comply with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or any service providers\u2019, contractors\u2019 or future collaborators\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information\nabout how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Further, on November 3, 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CRO, and contractors must comply. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal information of individuals within the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and the United Kingdom, including, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has and will continue to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. In addition, the GDPR provides for more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Relatedly, following the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EEA and the EU, and the expiry of the transition period, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk. As we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements with regard to our continued development of STS101;\n\u2022\nannouncements with regard to our strategic business and/or financing plans;\n\u2022\nresults from, and any delays in, our clinical trials for STS101;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements by academic, guideline publishers or other third parties challenging the fundamental premises underlying our approach to treating migraine;\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory approval or disapproval of STS101;\n\u2022\nfailure or discontinuation of any of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing setbacks or delays of or issues with the supply of the materials for STS101;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to future licensing, collaboration or development agreements, including the early termination or failure of an existing strategic collaboration;\n\u2022\ndelays in the commercialization of STS101;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and sales of new products, technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our future competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n\u2022\nany major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nnew legislation in the United States or relevant foreign jurisdictions relating to the sale or pricing of pharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims or other litigation or public concern about the safety of STS101 or other DHE products;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including recession or depression resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and resources and the attention of our management could be diverted from the operation of our business.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Jumpstart Our Business Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtaining stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or\nrevised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2024, (2) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to compliance initiatives. We may fail to comply with the rules that apply to public companies, including Section 404, which could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, filing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations associated with being a public company have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage.\nWe are subject to Section 404 and the related rules of the SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with this annual report, Section 404 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2024, (2) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nTo date, we have never conducted a review of our internal control for the purpose of providing the reports required by these rules. In connection with the contemporaneous audits of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we identified control deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness. While we believe we have fully remediated the material weakness in our internal controls, if additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting are identified in the future, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an\nongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, as a public company we will be required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. In order to report our results of operations and financial statements on an accurate and timely basis, we will depend on CROs to provide timely and accurate notice of their costs to us. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The Nasdaq Global Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm to our business.\nWe are also subject to more stringent state law requirements. For example, on September 30, 2018, the then California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Senator Bill 826, which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to have a minimum number of females on the company\u2019s board of directors. By December 31, 2019, each public company with principal executive offices in California is required to have at least one female on its board of directors. By December 31, 2021, each public company is required to have at least two females on its board of directors if the company has at least five directors, and at least three females on its board of directors if the company has at least six directors. The new law does not provide a transition period for newly listed companies. We do not currently meet the December 31, 2021 requirement.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 979 (AB 979), which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to include specified numbers of directors from \"underrepresented communities.\" A director from an \"underrepresented community\" means a director who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. By December 31, 2021, each public company with principal executive offices in California is required to have at least one director from an underrepresented community. By December 31, 2022, a public company with more than four but fewer than nine directors will be required to have a minimum of two directors from underrepresented communities, and a public company with nine or more directors will need to have a minimum of three directors from underrepresented communities. Similar to SB 826, AB 979 does not provide a transition period for newly listed companies. Although we currently meet the December 31, 2021 requirement, there is no guarantee we will continue to do so in the future.\nIf we fail to comply with SB 826 or AB979, we could be fined by the California Secretary of State, with a $100,000 fine for the first violation and a $300,000 for each subsequent violation, and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock, including pursuant to our 2019 Incentive Award Plan and 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history, do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to incur losses for tax purposes, or NOLs, such NOLs, will carry forward to offset a portion of future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs expire, if subject to expiration. Under current tax law, federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely but may only be used to offset 80% of our taxable income in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its\nequity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. If finalized, Treasury Regulations currently proposed under Section 382 of the Code may further limit our ability to utilize our pre-change NOLs or credits if we undergo a future ownership change. Our ability to utilize NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities may be currently limited as a result of prior ownership changes, including in connection with our IPO. Similar rules may apply under our state or foreign tax laws. We have not completed a formal study to determine if any ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 and 383 of the Code have occurred. While we do not believe we have experienced ownership changes in the past, it is possible we have done so, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). If an ownership change has occurred, our ability to use our NOLs or tax credit carryforwards may be restricted, which could require us to pay federal or state income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise become unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions will include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our chief executive officer or president or by the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction. For a description of our capital stock, see \u201cDescription of Capital Stock\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction; and provided further that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\nWe believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and\nregulations thereunder. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that will be contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Further, we are currently subject to covenants under our Loan Agreement that place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A global financial crisis or a global or regional political disruption could cause extreme volatility in the capital markets and lead to diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For instance, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to a period of considerable uncertainty and volatility. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for STS101, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or resulting in the inability of any future customers to pay for STS101, if approved. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of STS101.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the planned clinical testing of STS101 and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize it. For example, we may be sued if STS101 allegedly causes injury. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranty. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of STS101. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for STS101;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize STS101.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of STS101. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical trials, however, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If and when we obtain approval for marketing any dose of STS101, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include its sale; however, we may be unable to obtain this liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe depend on our and our third-party suppliers or providers\u2019 information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business. Any real or perceived security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions or incidents could compromise the privacy, security, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability and reputational harm, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain data and information that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, including systems infrastructure operated and maintained by our third-party suppliers or providers. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the privacy, security, confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems and facilities to prevent an information compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage or unauthorized access or use resulting from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, denial-of-service attacks, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, hacking, phishing and other social engineering attacks, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization (including employees or contractors), lost or stolen devices, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. These challenges have been made more difficult by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shelter-in-place and stay-at-home restrictions, which are driving greater dependency on electronic monitoring of our clinical trial sites. Such monitoring could prove to be less reliable and could increase data privacy and cybersecurity risks.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption or data loss, particularly through social engineering attacks, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us to mitigate, investigate and respond to potential security incidents, breaches, disruptions, network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned\nclinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Moreover, if a real or perceived security breach affects our systems (or those of our third-party providers or suppliers) or results in the loss of or accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access to, use of, release of or other processing of personally identifiable information or clinical trial data, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations promulgated thereunder, regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss, negative publicity, harm to our reputation, governmental investigation and/or enforcement actions, claims or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we may be affected by or subject to new, amended or existing laws and regulations in the future, including as our operations continue to expand or if we begin to operate in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, any future commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, data privacy and security laws and other similar non-U.S. laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. federal healthcare programs or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. We may license our trademarks and trade names to third parties, such as distributors. Though these license agreements may provide guidelines for how our trademarks and trade names may be used, a breach of\nthese agreements or misuse of our trademarks and tradenames by our licensees may jeopardize our rights in or diminish the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in patent law in the U.S. or in other countries could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect STS101.\nOur patent rights may be affected by developments or uncertainty in U.S. or ex-U.S. patent statutes, patent case laws in USPTO rules and regulations or in the rules and regulations of ex-U.S. patent offices. There are a number of recent changes to the U.S. patent laws that may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO, and may become involved in post-grant proceedings including opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position. This could have a negative impact on some of our intellectual property and could increase uncertainties surrounding obtaining and enforcement or defense of issued patents relating to STS101. In addition, Congress may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might obtain in the future.\nSimilarly, statutory or judicial changes to the patent laws of other countries may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending all current and future patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with STS101, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe legal systems of many foreign countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and\ncould provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the U.S. in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We employ reputable professionals and rely on such third parties to help us comply with these requirements and effect payment of these fees with respect to the patents and patent applications that we own, and if we license intellectual property we may have to rely upon our licensors to comply with these requirements and effect payment of these fees with respect to any patents and patent applications that we license. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make therapies that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, demand for our common stock could decrease and our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 18960, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "STSA"}
