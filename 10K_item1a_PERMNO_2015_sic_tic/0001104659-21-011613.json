{"cik": "1038074", "company": "SILICON LABORATORIES INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nGlobal Business Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel and transportation and other actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the business of our suppliers or customers and other items identified in the risk factors below, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health crisis, on our business, customers, suppliers, employees, markets and financial results and condition are uncertain, evolving and dependent on numerous unpredictable factors outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf The duration and impact of a global economic recession or depression that could further reduce demand and/or pricing for our products;\n\u25cf Disruptions to our business and supply chain (and the business and supply chains of our customers) in connection with the sourcing of materials, equipment and engineering support, and services from geographic areas impacted by the public health crisis, including disruptions caused by illnesses, quarantines and restrictions on people\u2019s ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, and other travel or health-related restrictions;\n\u25cf Delays or limitations on the ability of our customers to make timely payments;\n\u25cf Governmental actions to limit exposure to and spreading of such infectious diseases, such as travel restrictions, quarantines and business shutdowns or slowdowns, facility closures or other restrictions;\n\u25cf Deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures or to refinance our existing indebtedness;\n\u25cf Potential asset impairments, including goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets;\n\u25cf Complexities related to our employees temporarily working from home as well as increased cyber-related risks due to our employees working from home;\n\u25cf Potential failure of our computer systems or communication systems; and\n\u25cf Investment-related risks, including difficulties in liquidating investments due to current market conditions and adverse investment performance.\nThere can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession, economic downturn or increased unemployment that has occurred or may occur in the future. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has been subject to significant fluctuations\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has experienced significant fluctuations, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and new product introductions of both semiconductor companies' and their customers' products and fluctuations in general economic conditions. Deteriorating general worldwide economic conditions, including reduced economic activity, concerns about credit and inflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits, decreased spending and similar adverse business conditions, would make it very difficult for our customers, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or economic recovery. If the economy or markets in which we operate deteriorate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nDownturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Upturns have been characterized by increased product demand and production capacity constraints created by increased competition for access to third-party foundry, assembly and test capacity. We are dependent on the availability of such capacity to manufacture, assemble and test our products. Foundry, assembly and test capacity is currently limited due to a spike in semiconductor demand. None of our third-party foundry, assembly or test subcontractors have provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused further global economic uncertainty. The impact from the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain, disrupting the business of our customers and suppliers, and could impact our business and operating results in the future.\nWe are a global company, which subjects us to additional business risks including logistical and financial complexity, political instability and currency fluctuations\nWe have established international subsidiaries and have opened offices in international markets to support our activities in Asia, the Americas and Europe. This has included the establishment of a headquarters in Singapore for non-U.S. operations. During fiscal 2020, the percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the United States was 90% (and the revenue associated with end customers in China was 26%, and revenue attributed to China based on shipped-to location was 45)%. We may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for our products. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf Complexity and costs of managing international operations and related tax obligations, including our headquarters for non-U.S. operations in Singapore;\n\u25cf Protectionist laws and business practices, including trade restrictions, tariffs, export controls, quotas and other trade barriers, including China-U.S. trade policies and the potential effects of Brexit;\n\u25cf Trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty, or governmental actions, including those arising from the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, may lead customers to favor products from non-US companies which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in decreased customer demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf Restrictions or tariffs imposed on certain countries and sanctions or export controls imposed on customers or suppliers may affect our ability to sell and source our products;\n\u25cf Difficulties related to the protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect our international operations, suppliers and customers and we may experience delays in product development, a decreased ability to support our customers and reduced design win activity if the travel restrictions or business shutdowns or slowdowns continue for an extended period of time in any of the countries in which we, our suppliers and our customers operate and do business;\n\u25cf Multiple, conflicting and changing tax and other laws and regulations that may impact both our international and domestic tax and other liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we expect to increase our effective tax rate, in part due to the impact of the requirement to capitalize and amortize foreign research and development expenses beginning in 2022;\n\u25cf Longer sales cycles;\n\u25cf Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u25cf High levels of distributor inventory subject to price protection and rights of return to us;\n\u25cf Political and economic instability;\n\u25cf Greater difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf The need to have business and operations systems that can meet the needs of our international business and operating structure.\nTo date, substantially all of our sales to international customers and purchases of components from international suppliers have been denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for our international customers to purchase, thus rendering our products less competitive. Similarly, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar could reduce our buying power with respect to international suppliers.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on a limited number of new technologies and products, and any delay in the development, or abandonment, of these technologies or products by industry participants, or their failure to achieve market acceptance, could compromise our competitive position\nOur products serve as components and solutions in electronic devices in various markets. As a result, we have devoted and expect to continue to devote a large amount of resources to develop products based on new and emerging technologies and standards that will be commercially introduced in the future. Research and development expense during fiscal 2020 was $287.9 million, or 32.5% of revenues. A number of companies are actively involved in the development of these new technologies and standards. Should any of these companies delay or abandon their efforts to develop commercially available products based on new technologies and standards, our research and development efforts with respect to these technologies and standards likely would have no appreciable value. In addition, if we do not correctly anticipate new technologies and standards, or if the products that we develop based on these new technologies and standards fail to achieve market acceptance, our competitors may be better able to address market demand than we would. Furthermore, if markets for these new technologies and standards develop later than we anticipate, or do not develop at all, demand for our products that are currently in development would suffer, resulting in lower sales of these products than we currently anticipate.\nCompetition within the numerous markets we target may reduce sales of our products and reduce our market share\nThe markets for semiconductors in general, and for mixed-signal products in particular, are intensely competitive. We expect that the market for our products will continually evolve and will be subject to rapid technological change. In addition, as we target and supply products to numerous markets and applications, we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors. We compete with AltoBeam, Analog Devices, Aura, Broadcom, Dialog, Espressif, Infineon, Maxim Integrated Products, MaxLinear, MediaTek, Microchip, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP, Qualcomm, Rafael, Renesas, STMicroelectronics, Synaptics, Telink, Texas Instruments and others. We expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors, other manufacturers and designers of semiconductors, and start-up semiconductor design companies. As the markets for communications products grow, we also may face competition from traditional communications device companies. These companies may enter the mixed-signal semiconductor market by introducing their own products or by entering into strategic relationships with or acquiring other existing providers of semiconductor products. In addition, large companies may restructure their operations to create separate companies or may acquire new businesses that are focused on providing the types of products we produce or acquire our customers.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products and the failure to successfully manage our relationships with our manufacturers and subcontractors would negatively impact our ability to sell our products\nWe do not have our own wafer fab manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we rely on third-party vendors to manufacture the products we design. We also currently rely on Asian third-party assembly subcontractors to assemble and package the silicon chips provided by the wafers for use in final products. Additionally, we rely on these offshore subcontractors for a substantial portion of the testing requirements of our products prior to shipping. We expect utilization of third-party subcontractors to continue in the future.\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry drives wide fluctuations in available capacity at third-party vendors. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer demand due to capacity constraints and, therefore, were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. We may be unable to obtain adequate foundry, assembly or test capacity from our third-party subcontractors to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements even if we adequately forecast customer demand. For example, foundry, assembly and test capacity is currently limited due to a spike in semiconductor demand. As a result, we have recently experienced longer lead times at certain third-party foundry subcontractors. In addition, use of subcontractors outside of China has increased due to U.S.-China trade concerns. This is resulting in competing demand for capacity at our suppliers. Such conditions may adversely affect our revenue and increase our costs.\nThere are significant risks associated with relying on these third-party foundries and subcontractors, including:\n\u25cf Failure by us, our customers or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;\n\u25cf Potential insolvency of the third-party subcontractors;\n\u25cf Reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n\u25cf Limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us;\n\u25cf Potential increases in prices or payments in advance for capacity;\n\u25cf Increased need for international-based supply, logistics and financial management;\n\u25cf Disruption to our supply chain resulting from cyber-attacks on our suppliers\u2019 information technology systems;\n\u25cf Their inability to supply or support new or changing packaging technologies; and\n\u25cf Low test yields.\nWe typically do not have long-term supply contracts with our third-party vendors which obligate the vendor to perform services and supply products to us for a specific period, in specific quantities, and at specific prices. Our third-party foundry, assembly and test subcontractors typically do not guarantee that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet demand for our products. In the event that these vendors fail to meet our demand for whatever reason, we expect that it would take up to 12 months to transition performance of these services to new providers. Such a transition may also require qualification of the new providers by our customers or their end customers.\nIf our suppliers experience closures or reductions in their capacity utilization levels in the future, we may have difficulty sourcing materials necessary to fulfill production requirements. Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our suppliers\u2019 production capabilities as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies or delays caused by restrictions on travel.\nMost of the silicon wafers for the products that we have sold were manufactured either by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) or Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). Our customers typically complete their own qualification process. If we fail to properly balance customer demand across the existing semiconductor fabrication facilities that we utilize or are required by our foundry partners to increase, or otherwise change the number of fab lines that we utilize for our production, we might not be able to fulfill demand for our products and may need to divert our engineering resources away from new product development initiatives to support the fab line transition, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may not be able to maintain our historical growth and may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, which may result in volatility in our stock price\nAlthough we have generally experienced revenue growth in our history, we may not be able to sustain this growth. We may also experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results in the future due to a number of factors, and any such variations may cause our stock price to fluctuate. In some future period our revenues or operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If this occurs, our stock price may drop, perhaps significantly.\nA number of factors, in addition to those cited in other risk factors applicable to our business, may contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, including:\n\u25cf The timing and volume of orders received from our customers;\n\u25cf The timeliness of our new product introductions and the rate at which our new products may cannibalize our older products;\n\u25cf The rate of acceptance of our products by our customers, including the acceptance of new products we may develop for integration in the products manufactured by such customers, which we refer to as \u201cdesign wins\u201d;\n\u25cf The time lag and realization rate between \u201cdesign wins\u201d and production orders;\n\u25cf Supplier capacity constraints;\n\u25cf The demand for, and life cycles of, the products incorporating our mixed-signal solutions;\n\u25cf The rate of adoption of mixed-signal products in the markets we target;\n\u25cf Deferrals or reductions of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors or other providers of mixed-signal ICs;\n\u25cf Changes in product mix;\n\u25cf The average selling prices for our products could drop suddenly due to competitive offerings or competitive predatory pricing;\n\u25cf The average selling prices for our products generally decline over time;\n\u25cf Changes in market standards;\n\u25cf Impairment charges related to inventory, equipment or other long-lived assets;\n\u25cf The software used in our products, including software provided by third parties, may not meet the needs of our customers;\n\u25cf Our customers may not be able to obtain other components such as capacitors (which are currently in short supply) that they need to incorporate in conjunction with our products, leading to potential downturn in the demand for our products;\n\u25cf Significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights or respond to claims against us; and\n\u25cf The rate at which new markets emerge for products we are currently developing or for which our design expertise can be utilized to develop products for these new markets.\nThe markets for consumer electronics, for example, are characterized by rapid fluctuations in demand and seasonality that result in corresponding fluctuations in the demand for our products that are incorporated in such devices. Additionally, the rate of technology acceptance by our customers results in fluctuating demand for our products as customers are reluctant to incorporate a new IC into their products until the new IC has achieved market acceptance. Once a new IC achieves market acceptance, demand for the new IC can quickly accelerate to a point and then level off such that rapid historical growth in sales of a product should not be viewed as indicative of continued future growth. In addition, demand can quickly decline for a product when a new IC product is introduced and receives market acceptance. Due to the various factors mentioned above, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly which may negatively impact our revenues and gross profit\nWe may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. We have reduced the average unit price of our products in anticipation of or in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. If we are unable to offset any such reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, increasing our sales content per application or reducing production costs, our gross profit and revenues will suffer. To maintain our gross profit, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our costs. Our failure to do so could cause our revenues and gross profit to decline.\nWe depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We believe that our future success will be dependent on retaining the services of our key personnel, developing their successors and certain internal processes to reduce our reliance on specific individuals, and on properly managing the transition of key roles when they occur. There is currently a shortage of qualified personnel with significant experience in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of analog and mixed-signal products. In particular, there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacturability of analog elements, and competition for such personnel is intense. Our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the primary source for our technological and product innovations. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth. The loss of any of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel both in the United States and internationally, including engineers, sales, applications and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products.\nIf we are unable to develop or acquire new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, our operating results and competitive position could be harmed\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. The development of mixed-signal ICs is highly complex, and we have at times experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements. Successful product development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Requirements of customers;\n\u25cf Accurate prediction of market and technical requirements;\n\u25cf Timely completion and introduction of new designs;\n\u25cf Timely qualification and certification of our products for use in our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf Commercial acceptance and volume production of the products into which our ICs will be incorporated;\n\u25cf Availability of foundry, assembly and test capacity;\n\u25cf Achievement of high manufacturing yields;\n\u25cf Quality, price, performance, power use and size of our products;\n\u25cf Availability, quality, price and performance of competing products and technologies;\n\u25cf Our customer service, application support capabilities and responsiveness;\n\u25cf Successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers;\n\u25cf Technology, industry standards or end-user preferences; and\n\u25cf Cooperation of third-party software providers and our semiconductor vendors to support our chips within a system.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that products which we recently have developed or may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. We have introduced to market or are in development of many products. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to develop new products on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected. The growth of the IoT market is dependent on the adoption of industry standards to permit devices to connect and communicate with each other. If the industry cannot agree on a common set of standards, then the growth of the IoT market may be slower than expected.\nAny acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition\nAs part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities. The acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including:\n\u25cf Problems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our existing business and products;\n\u25cf Diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from our core business;\n\u25cf Need for financial resources above our planned investment levels;\n\u25cf Difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired company;\n\u25cf Risks associated with entering markets in which we lack prior experience;\n\u25cf Risks associated with the transfer of licenses of intellectual property;\n\u25cf Increased operating costs due to acquired overhead;\n\u25cf Tax issues associated with acquisitions;\n\u25cf Acquisition-related disputes, including disputes over earn-outs and escrows;\n\u25cf Potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and\n\u25cf Potential impairment of related goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn particular, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to complete and integrate any future acquisition into our business is unpredictable and will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel and transportation, and other actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Future acquisitions also could cause us to incur debt or contingent liabilities or cause us to issue equity securities that could negatively impact the ownership percentages of existing shareholders.\nWe may be the victim of business disruptions and security breaches, including cyber-attacks, which could lead to liability or could damage our reputation and financial results\nInformation technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of the cause, but including acts of sabotage, error, or other actions, could harm the company\u2019s operations. Failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from security breaches, including cyber-attacks, could result in the misuse of company assets, disruption to the company, diversion of management resources, regulatory inquiries, legal claims or proceedings, reputational damage, loss of sales and other costs to the company. We routinely face attacks that attempt to breach our security protocols, gain access to or disrupt our computerized systems or steal proprietary company, customer, partner or employee information. These attacks are sometimes successful. These attacks may be due to security breaches, employee error, theft, malfeasance, phishing schemes, ransomware, faulty password or data security management, or other irregularities. The theft, loss, destruction, unavailability or misuse of personal or business data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Industrial espionage, theft or loss of our intellectual property data could lead to counterfeit products or harm the competitive position of our products and services. Costs to implement, test and maintain measures to promote compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws as well as to protect the overall security of our system could be significant. Attempted or successful attacks against our products and services could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services.\nAdditionally, there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges as a result of most of our employees and our service providers working remotely from non-corporate managed networks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potentially continuing working remotely even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nFailure to manage our distribution channel relationships could impede our future growth\nThe future growth of our business will depend in large part on our ability to manage our relationships with current and future distributors and sales representatives, develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products and manage these relationships. During fiscal 2020, 78% of our revenue was derived from distributors. As we execute our indirect sales strategy, we must manage the potential conflicts that may arise with our direct sales efforts. For example, conflicts with a distributor may arise when a customer begins purchasing directly from us rather than through the distributor. The inability to successfully execute or manage a multi-channel sales strategy could impede our future growth. In addition, relationships with our distributors often involve the use of price protection and inventory return rights. This often requires a significant amount of sales management\u2019s time and system resources to manage properly. Because we consolidated our distribution relationships to a single global distributor, Arrow Electronics, in fiscal 2018, termination of the relationship with Arrow Electronics, either by us or by Arrow Electronics, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of revenue. If Arrow Electronics fails to effectively market and sell our products in full compliance with applicable laws, or if we are unable to maintain our existing relationship with Arrow Electronics, we may not be able to find a distributor with the scale and resources of Arrow Electronics, maintain existing levels of international revenue or realize expected long-term international revenue growth. We may not be successful in finding suitable alternative global distributors on satisfactory terms, or at all, and this could adversely affect our ability to effectively sell our solutions in certain geographical locations or to certain end customers.\nWe do not have long-term commitments from our customers\nOur customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which increases their negotiating leverage with us and protects their ability to secure these components. We believe that any expansion of our customers' supplier bases could have an adverse effect on the prices we are able to charge and volume of product that we are able to sell to our customers, which would negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nCustomers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns, particularly because:\n\u25cf We do not have material long-term purchase contracts with our customers;\n\u25cf Substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;\n\u25cf Some of our customers may have efforts underway to actively diversify their vendor base which could reduce purchases of our products; and\n\u25cf Some of our customers have developed or acquired products that compete directly with products these customers purchase from us, which could affect our customers' purchasing decisions in the future.\nWe are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products\nIn order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers, we start the manufacturing of our products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers. However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to the customer. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales. Because demand for our products may not materialize, manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs, increased obsolescence and increased operating costs. These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this causes us to have less visibility regarding the accumulated levels of inventory for such customers. A resulting write-off of unusable or excess inventories would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur products are complex and may contain errors which could lead to liability, an increase in our costs and/or a reduction in our revenues\nOur products are complex and may contain errors, particularly when first introduced and/or when new versions are released. Our products are increasingly designed in more complex processes, including higher levels of software and hardware integration in modules and system-level solutions and/or include elements provided by third parties which further increase the risk of errors. We rely primarily on our in-house testing personnel to design test operations and procedures to detect any errors or vulnerabilities prior to delivery of our products to our customers.\nShould problems occur in the operation or performance of our products, we may experience delays in meeting key introduction dates or scheduled delivery dates to our customers. These errors could also cause significant re-engineering costs, the diversion of our engineering personnel\u2019s attention from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems. Any defects could result in refunds, product replacement, product recall or other liability. Any of the foregoing could impose substantial costs and harm our business.\nProduct liability, data breach or cyber liability claims may be asserted with respect to our products. Many of our products focus on wireless connectivity and the IoT market and such connectivity may make these products particularly susceptible to cyber-attacks. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the end-products into which they are incorporated. A defect, failure or vulnerability in our product could cause failure in our customer\u2019s end-product, so we could face claims for damages that are disproportionately higher than the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. Furthermore, product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to medical and automotive applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these end-products. There can be no assurance that any insurance we maintain will sufficiently protect us from such claims.\nWe may be subject to information technology failures that could damage our reputation, business operations and financial condition\nWe rely on information technology for the effective operation of our business. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, theft, physical or electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, or similar events or disruptions. Our security measures may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Any such compromise of our information security could result in the theft or unauthorized publication or use of our confidential business or proprietary information, result in the unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation. In addition, our inability to use or access information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nThird parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors and customers, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these third parties do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches could result and negatively impact our reputation, business operations and financial results. Additionally, a successful cyber-attack against one of these third-parties\u2019 information technology systems may disrupt our supply chain.\nOur customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves testing of the products in the customer\u2019s system as well as rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or longer. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product or software, changes in the IC\u2019s manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.\nOur inability to manage growth could materially and adversely affect our business\nOur past growth has placed, and any future growth of our operations will continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded sales, operational and financial enterprise-wide systems, information technology infrastructure, procedures and controls, including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems to manage this growth and maintain compliance with regulatory guidelines, including Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. To the extent our business grows, our internal management systems and processes will need to improve to ensure that we remain in compliance. We also expect that we will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort, and we anticipate that we will require additional management personnel and internal processes to manage these efforts and to plan for the succession from time to time of certain persons who have been key management and technical personnel. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding global operations, including our international headquarters in Singapore, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks relating to product concentration\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products, is therefore, critical to our future success. In addition, substantially all of our products that we have sold include technology related to one or more of our issued U.S. patents. If these patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our competitors could introduce competitive products that could reduce both the volume and price per unit of our products. Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:\n\u25cf A decline in demand for any of our more significant products;\n\u25cf Failure of our products to achieve continued market acceptance;\n\u25cf Competitive products;\n\u25cf New technological standards or changes to existing standards that we are unable to address with our products;\n\u25cf A failure to release new products or enhanced versions of our existing products on a timely basis; and\n\u25cf The failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance.\nAny dispositions could harm our financial condition\nAny disposition of a product line would entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including:\n\u25cf Diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from our core business;\n\u25cf Difficulties separating the divested business;\n\u25cf Risks to relations with customers who previously purchased products from our disposed product line;\n\u25cf Reduced leverage with suppliers due to reduced aggregate volume;\n\u25cf Risks related to employee relations;\n\u25cf Risks associated with the transfer and licensing of intellectual property;\n\u25cf Security risks and other liabilities related to the transition services provided in connection with the disposition;\n\u25cf Tax issues associated with dispositions; and\n\u25cf Disposition-related disputes, including disputes over earn-outs and escrows.\nMost of our current manufacturers, assemblers, test service providers, distributors and customers are concentrated in the same geographic region, which increases the risk that a natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest could disrupt our operations or sales\nMost of our foundries and several of our assembly and test subcontractors\u2019 sites are located in Taiwan and most of our other foundry, assembly and test subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region. In addition, many of our customers are located in the Pacific Rim region. The risk of earthquakes in Taiwan and the Pacific Rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines in the area. Earthquakes, tsunamis, fire, flooding, lack of water or other natural disasters, an epidemic such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, political unrest, war, labor strikes or work stoppages in countries where our semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers and test subcontractors are located, likely would result in the disruption of our foundry, assembly or test capacity. There can be no assurance that alternate capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.\nA natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest where our customers\u2019 facilities are located would likely reduce our sales to such customers. In addition, a significant portion of the assembly and testing of our products occurs in South Korea. Any disruption resulting from these events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could also cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembling or testing from the affected subcontractor to another third-party vendor. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to progress in ways that significantly disrupt the manufacture, shipment and sales of our products or the products of our customers, this may materially negatively impact our operating results for subsequent periods. For example, if the travel restrictions or business shutdowns or slowdowns continue for an extended period of time in Taiwan, South Korea or the other countries in which our current manufacturers, assemblers, test service providers, distributors and customers are located, we may experience delays in product production, a decreased ability to support our customers, reduced design win activity, and overall lack of productivity. Our customers may also experience closures of their manufacturing facilities or inability to obtain other components, either of which could negatively impact demand for our solutions.\nThe semiconductor manufacturing process is highly complex and, from time to time, manufacturing yields may fall below our expectations, which could result in our inability to satisfy demand for our products in a timely manner and may decrease our gross profit due to higher unit costs\nThe manufacturing of our products is a highly complex and technologically demanding process. Although we work closely with our foundries and assemblers to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance deficiencies, which could lower our gross profit. If our foundries fail to deliver fabricated silicon wafers of satisfactory quality in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 demand for our products in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.\nWe depend on our customers to support our products, and some of our customers offer competing products\nWe rely on our customers to provide hardware, software, intellectual property indemnification and other technical support for the products supplied by our customers. If our customers do not provide the required functionality or if our customers do not provide satisfactory support for their products, the demand for these devices that incorporate our products may diminish or we may otherwise be materially adversely affected. Any reduction in the demand for these devices would significantly reduce our revenues.\nIn certain products, some of our customers offer their own competitive products. These customers may find it advantageous to support their own offerings in the marketplace in lieu of promoting our products.\nWe have limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase market share\nSome of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours. In addition, some of our current and potential competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with the decision makers at our current or potential customers. These competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage their customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our products with their products. Our competitors may also offer bundled solutions offering a more complete product despite the technical merits or advantages of our products. These competitors may elect not to support our products which could complicate our sales efforts. We also face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions, as well as China-U.S. trade barriers, may restrict our participation in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies or companies from other countries that China favors over the United States. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, which may include price concessions, delayed payment terms, financing terms, or other terms and conditions that are more enticing to potential customers. These and other competitive pressures may prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors, and may materially harm our business. Competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our gross profit and/or decrease our market share.\nChanges in the Privacy and Data Security/Protection Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on our Operations\nFederal, state and international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operations. Complying with these laws and the possibility of proceedings against us by governmental entities or others in relation to these laws could increase operational costs. In May 2018, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) went into effect, replacing the EU\u2019s 1995 Data Protection Directive. The costs of compliance with the GDPR and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur products must conform to industry standards and technology in order to be accepted by end users in our markets\nGenerally, our products comprise only a part of a device. All components of such devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in affecting industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected which would harm our business.\nProducts for certain applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins. For example, the IoT market is relatively new and is continuously evolving. Furthermore, products in the IoT market frequently require interoperability across multiple standards. We may need to adjust our portfolio to meet the needs of this evolving market through acquisitions or significant new investments in research and development.\nOur pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense. We may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nSignificant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which could adversely affect our business\nThe semiconductor and software industries have experienced significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including non-practicing entities, allege intellectual property infringement by our products, our customers\u2019 products, or products using technologies or communications standards used in our industry. We also receive communications from customers or suppliers requesting indemnification for allegations brought against them by third parties. Some of these allegations have resulted, and may result in the future, in our involvement in litigation. We have certain contractual obligations to defend and indemnify our customers from certain infringement claims. We also have been involved in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights in the past and may become involved in such litigation again in the future.\nGiven the unpredictable nature of litigation and the complexity of the technology, we may not prevail in any such litigation. Legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability, invalidate our proprietary rights, or harm our businesses and our ability to compete. Legal proceedings initiated by us to protect our intellectual property rights could also result in counterclaims or countersuits against us. Any litigation, regardless of its outcome or merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert our management\u2019s time and attention. Intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions, including:\n\u25cf Cease using, selling or manufacturing certain products, services or processes;\n\u25cf Attempt to obtain a license, which license may require the payment of substantial royalties or may not be available on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u25cf Incur significant costs, time delays and lost business opportunities to develop alternative technologies or redesign products; or\n\u25cf Pursue legal remedies with third parties to enforce our indemnification rights, which may not adequately protect our interests.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete\nOur products rely on our proprietary technology, and we expect that future technological advances made by us will be critical to sustain market acceptance of our products. Therefore, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, intellectual property providers and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications nor can we be certain that any issued patents would protect or benefit us or give us adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid or unenforceable. We also cannot be certain that others will not develop effective competing technologies on their own.\nOur products incorporate technology licensed from third parties\nWe incorporate technology (including software) licensed from third parties in our products. We could be subjected to claims of infringement regardless of our lack of involvement in the development of the licensed technology. Although a third-party licensor is typically obligated to indemnify us if the licensed technology infringes on another party\u2019s intellectual property rights, such indemnification is typically limited in amount and may be worthless if the licensor becomes insolvent. See Significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, any failure of third-party technology to perform properly would adversely affect sales of our products incorporating such technology.\nLiquidity and Credit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risks related to our accounts receivable\nWe do not generally obtain letters of credit or other security for payment from customers, distributors or contract manufacturers. Accordingly, we are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these entities. Our ten largest customers or distributors represent a substantial majority of our accounts receivable. If any such customer or distributor, or a material portion of our smaller customers or distributors, were to become insolvent or otherwise not satisfy their obligations to us, we could be materially harmed.\nOur convertible senior notes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition\nUpon conversion, our convertible senior notes may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at our election. We intend to settle the principal amount of the notes in cash. If we do not have adequate cash available, we may not be able to settle the principal amount in cash. In such case, we will be required to settle the principal amount in stock, which would result in immediate, and likely material, dilution to the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nFollowing any conclusion that we no longer have the ability to settle the convertible senior notes in cash, we will be required on a going forward basis to change our accounting policy for earnings per share from the treasury stock method to the if-converted method. Earnings per share may be lower under the if-converted method as compared to the treasury stock method.\nThe principal balance of the convertible senior notes was separated into liability and equity components, which were recorded initially at fair value. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount represents the debt discount, which is accreted to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Accordingly, we will report higher interest expense because of the recognition of both the debt discount amortization and the notes\u2019 coupon interest.\nOn January 6, 2021, we issued a notice of redemption for the remaining $140.6 million principal amount of our 2022 convertible senior notes. The redemption will occur on March 22, 2021, unless earlier converted.\nOur debt could adversely affect our operations and financial condition\nWe believe we have the ability to service our debt, but our ability to make the required payments thereunder when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and other factors affecting our operations, including risk factors described herein, such as the potential implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are beyond our control. Our credit facility also contains covenants, including financial covenants. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to any applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable.\nWe could seek to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future, but additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and commitments for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to borrow further under the credit facility is dependent upon our ability to satisfy various conditions, covenants and representations. It is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities or to facilitate acquisitions of other businesses, products, intellectual property or technologies. We believe we could raise these funds, if needed, by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. However, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all, particularly during financial market instability related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we decide to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced.\nStock and Governance Risks\nOur stock price may be volatile\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors:\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf Changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;\n\u25cf Changes in market valuations of other technology companies, particularly semiconductor companies;\n\u25cf Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf Introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;\n\u25cf The loss of, or decrease in sales to, one or more key customers;\n\u25cf A large sale of stock by a significant shareholder;\n\u25cf Dilution from the issuance of our stock in connection with acquisitions;\n\u25cf The addition or removal of our stock to or from a stock index fund;\n\u25cf Departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf The required expensing of stock awards; and\n\u25cf The required changes in our reported revenue and revenue recognition accounting policy under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent, delay or impede a change in control of us and may reduce the market price of our common stock\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for:\n\u25cf The division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;\n\u25cf The ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of our stockholders;\n\u25cf A prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;\n\u25cf Elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf A requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders; and\n\u25cf A requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWe also are subject to the anti-takeover laws of Delaware which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87812, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "SLAB"}
