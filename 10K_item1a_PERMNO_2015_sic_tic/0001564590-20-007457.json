{"cik": "1593538", "company": "NAVIENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe employ an enterprise risk management philosophy and framework which seeks to identify the most significant risks impacting our business and provides a process for evaluating and quantifying such risks. Our Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee monitors approved risk limits and thresholds to ensure our businesses are operating within approved risk parameters. Our Risk Appetite Framework segments our risk across nine risk domains: (1) credit; (2) market; (3) funding and liquidity; (4) compliance; (5) legal; (6) operational; (7) reputational/political; (8) governance; and (9) strategy. The risk factors enumerated in this section are presented in a manner that is consistent with this overall risk framework.\nBased on current conditions, we believe that the following list identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These risks and risk domains are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations in future periods or are not identified because they are common to all businesses. In addition, our reaction to future developments as well as our competitors\u2019 and regulators\u2019 reactions to these developments may affect our future results.\nCREDIT RISK.\nEconomic conditions and the creditworthiness of third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the expected future creditworthiness of our customers, especially with respect to our education loans. Our research consistently indicates that borrower unemployment rates and the failure of in-school borrowers to graduate or otherwise complete their education are two of the most significant macroeconomic factors that affect loan performance. Any material changes in graduation or completion rates could increase or decrease delinquencies and defaults. Additionally, modifications to the original repayment terms in the form of loan forbearance, deferment, grace periods and the use of payment modification programs, including income-based repayment programs, can individually and cumulatively impact the performance of our loan portfolios. Modifications to private loans may lower the potential return on investment and may have the related effect of delaying defaults which would otherwise have become apparent in the performance of our portfolios. A deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the credit quality of our borrowers, resulting in an increased occurrence of defaults and/or requiring more frequent use of these loan modification tools. Higher credit-related losses and weaker credit quality could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and limit our funding options, including our access to the capital markets.\nDefaults on education loans held by us, particularly Private Education Loans, could adversely affect our earnings.\nFFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies and are also protected by contractual rights to recovery from the United States pursuant to guaranty agreements among ED and these agencies. These guarantees generally cover at least 97% of a FFELP Loan\u2019s principal and accrued interest upon default and, in limited circumstances, 100% of the loan\u2019s principal and accrued interest. We are exposed to credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the FFELP Loans in our portfolio. In addition, under certain circumstances, if we fail to service FFELP Loans in compliance with HEA we may jeopardize the insurance, guarantees and federal support we receive on these loans. A small percentage of our FFELP Loan portfolio has become permanently uninsured as a result of these regulations and we anticipate this will continue to a limited extent in the future. Under such circumstances, we bear the full credit exposure on such previously insured loans.\nWe bear the full credit exposure on the loans in our Consumer Lending portfolio. We believe that delinquencies are an important indicator of the potential future credit performance for Private Education Loans. Our delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment were 4.6% at December 31, 2019. For a complete discussion of our loan delinquencies, see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Private Education Loan Portfolio Performance.\u201d\nFuture defaults could be higher than anticipated due to a variety of factors outside of our control, such as downturns in the economy, regulatory changes and other unforeseen future trends. According to Company-sponsored independent research, young adults who stopped attending college before earning a degree or certificate are among those most likely to have trouble making payments. Losses on Private Education Loans are also impacted by various risk characteristics that may be specific to individual loans. Loan status (in-school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), loan seasoning (number of months in which a payment has been made by a customer), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), and existence of a cosigner are all factors that can impact the likelihood of default. The type of school may also play a significant role in loan performance. Additionally, general economic and employment conditions, including employment rates for recent college graduates, can have a significant impact on loan delinquency and default rates. If actual loan performance is worse than currently estimated, it could materially affect our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in our statements of income and as a result adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company recently adopted an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to measure and recognize an allowance for loan losses that estimates remaining expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date. This will result in us presenting certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as our loans held for investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and will require us to significantly increase our allowance, which will reduce shareholders\u2019 equity and capital. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the evaluation of our expected credit losses is inherently subjective and requires estimates that may be subject to significant changes.\nThe new CECL standard became effective for us on January 1, 2020. See \u201cNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for further discussion of the new standard and the expected impact as of the January 1, 2020 adoption date.\nOur Consumer Lending segment exposes us to credit underwriting risks based upon the credit model we use to forecast loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it can materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired Earnest, a leading financial technology and education finance company. Earnest is now one of the leading providers of education refinance loans. In 2019, Earnest entered the \u201cin-school\u201d lending market. We underwrite new Private Education Loans within our Consumer Lending segment based upon our analysis of extensive credit criteria. Criteria reviewed in underwriting consumer loans may include any or all of the following: (i) verified employment or offer of employment, income and assets, which are generally verified through\nconnected accounts; (ii) career experience, stability of employment, and specialization; (iii) qualifying credit history, taking into account credit score; (iv) debt to income ratio; (v) demonstrated ability to pay through free cash flow calculations; (vi) attendance at or graduation from an eligible post-secondary school; (vii) savings; and (viii) individual data points gathered from accounts connected in the application process, such as late fees, overdraft fees, and credit card interest. We define free cash flow generally as after-tax monthly income of a borrower minus the sum of rent or mortgage payments, student loan payments and any other fixed expenses of such borrower.\nWe do not rely on any single factor in making our underwriting decisions. Each of the above factors is reviewed and weighted depending on the individual borrower\u2019s or co-borrower\u2019s circumstances at the time the underwriting decision is made. If our underwriting process does not effectively forecast our losses, our operating results, cash flow or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nMARKET, FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK.\nOur business is affected by the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets.\nThe capital markets have from time to time experienced periods of significant volatility. This volatility can dramatically and adversely affect financing costs when compared to historical norms or make funding unavailable at any costs. Additional factors that could make financing more expensive or unavailable to us include, but are not limited to, financial losses, events that have an adverse impact on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry generally, counterparty availability, negative credit rating actions with respect to us, asset-backed securities sponsored by us or the U.S. federal government, changes affecting our assets, the ability of existing or future Navient-sponsored securitization trusts to hedge interest rate and currency risk, corporate and regulatory actions, absolute and comparative interest rate changes, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory and tax environments governing funding transactions, including existing or future securitization and derivatives transactions. If financing is difficult, expensive or unavailable, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe transition away from the LIBOR reference rate to an alternative reference rate may create uncertainty in the capital markets and may negatively impact the value of existing LIBOR based financial instruments.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, serves as a global benchmark for determining interest rates on commercial and consumer loans, bonds, derivatives and numerous other financial instruments. LIBOR is the reference rate for most of our student loans, consumer loans, bonds, asset-backed securities (\u201cABS\u201d), other financing facilities, and derivatives (\u201cfinancial instruments\u201d). On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that by the end of 2021, LIBOR would no longer be sustained through the FCA\u2019s efforts to compel banks\u2019 participation in setting the benchmark. The FCA\u2019s intention is that after 2021, it will no longer be necessary for the FCA to ask, or to require, banks to submit contributions to LIBOR. The FCA does not intend to sustain LIBOR using its influence or legal powers beyond that date. It is possible that the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the \u201cIBA\u201d), which took over administration of LIBOR on February 1, 2014, may be willing and able to produce LIBOR reference rates after 2021. However, at this time, we are unable to predict if LIBOR reference rates will stop being available or when that may occur. We are also unable to predict whether or when an alternative reference rate will become a standard global benchmark and suitable replacement for LIBOR. We are therefore unable to predict what the replacement reference rate or rates will be for our existing financial instruments that are currently indexed to LIBOR, the extent to which our financial instruments will transition to the same replacement reference rate, or the timing of a transition. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $250 billion notional of financial instruments indexed to LIBOR. Most of these financial instruments do not include provisions clearly specifying a method for transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate, and it is not yet known how courts or regulators will view the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate. As a result, it is difficult to predict the impact that a cessation of LIBOR would have on the value and performance of our existing financial instruments. These uncertainties regarding the possible cessation of LIBOR or their resolution could have a material adverse impact on our funding costs, net interest margin, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.\nHigher or lower than expected prepayments of loans could change the expected net interest income we receive as the holder of the Residual Interests of securitization trusts holding education loans or cause the bonds issued by a securitization trust to be paid at a different speed than originally anticipated. These factors could materially alter our net interest margin or the value of our Residual Interests.\nThe rate at which borrowers prepay their loans can have a material impact on our net interest margin and the value of our Residual Interests. Prepayment rates and levels are subject to a variety of economic, social, competitive and other factors, including changes in interest rates, availability of alternative financings, regulatory changes affecting the education loan market and the general economy. FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans may be voluntarily prepaid without penalty by the borrower or consolidated with the borrower\u2019s other loans through refinancing.\nFFELP Loans may also be repaid after default by the Guarantors of FFELP Loans. Conversely, borrowers might not choose to prepay their education loans, or the terms of the education loans may be extended as a result of grace\nperiods, deferment periods, income-driven repayment plans or other repayment terms or monthly payment amount modifications agreed to by the servicer, for example. FFELP Loan borrowers may be eligible for various existing income-based repayment programs under which borrowers can qualify for reduced or zero monthly payment or even debt forgiveness after a certain number of years of repayment.\nFuture initiatives by ED, or by Congress or future laws, executive orders or other policy statements to encourage or force consolidation, abolish existing or create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs or establish other policies and programs including but not limited to those proposed by several presidential campaigns could affect prepayments on education loans. We cannot predict if or when or in what form any of these future actions may occur. Prepayment rates can also be impacted by student loan refinancing. Refinance products offered by our Earnest subsidiary and our competitors may increase the repayment rate on our FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans.\nWhile we anticipate some variability in prepayment levels, extraordinary or extended increases or decreases in prepayment rates could materially affect our liquidity, interest income, net interest margin and the value of our Residual Interests. Additionally, a prolonged introduction of significant amounts of subsidized funding into the Private Education Loan market at below market interest rates - whether from federal or private sources -could increase the prepayment rates of our existing Private Education Loans and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. When, as a result of unanticipated prepayment levels, education loans within a securitization trust amortize faster than originally contracted, the trust\u2019s pool balance may decline at a rate faster than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust\u2019s bonds were originally issued. If the trust\u2019s pool balance declines faster than originally anticipated, in most of our securitization structures, the bonds issued by that trust will also be repaid faster than originally anticipated. In such cases, our net interest income may decrease and the value of any retained Residual Interest in the trust may similarly decline.\nConversely, when education loans within a securitization trust amortize more slowly than originally contracted, the trust\u2019s pool balance may decline more slowly than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust\u2019s bonds were originally issued, and the bonds may be repaid more slowly than originally anticipated. In these cases, our net interest income increases and the value of any retained Residual Interest in the trust may increase. In addition, if the prepayment rate is especially slow and certain rights of the sellers or the servicer are not exercised or are insufficient or other action is not taken to counter the slower prepayment rate, the trust\u2019s bonds may not be repaid by their legal final maturity date(s), which could result in an event of default under the underlying securitization agreements.\nFinally, rating agencies may place bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by a securitization trust, possibly raising or lowering their ratings, based upon these prepayment rates and their perception of the risk posed by those rates to the timing of the trust cash flows. Placing bonds on watch, changing ratings negatively, proposing or making changes to ratings methodology could: (i) affect our liquidity; (ii) impede our access to the securitization markets; (iii) require changes to our securitization structures; (iv) impact our net interest margins; and/or (v) raise or lower the value of our Residual Interests of our future securitization transactions.\nOur Floor Income is dependent on the future interest rate environment and therefore is variable, which may adversely affect our earnings.\nFFELP Loans disbursed before April 1, 2006 generally earn interest at the higher of either the borrower rate, which is fixed over a period of time, or a floating rate based on a Special Allowance Payment or SAP formula set by ED. We have generally financed our FFELP Loans with floating rate debt whose interest is matched closely to the floating nature of the applicable SAP formula. Historically, these loans have been indexed to either the Treasury bill, commercial paper or one-month LIBOR rates. If a decline in interest rates causes the borrower rate to exceed the SAP formula rate, we will continue to earn interest on the loan at the fixed borrower rate while the floating rate interest on our debt will continue to decline. The additional spread earned between the fixed borrower rate and the SAP formula rate is referred to as \u201cFloor Income.\u201d The replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate may have a further detrimental impact on our LIBOR-indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market borrowing activity transfers to other benchmark rates. Depending on the type of FFELP Loan and when it was originated, the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to a market rate on July 1 of each year. For loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term, we may earn Floor Income for an extended period of time; for those loans where the borrower interest rate is reset annually on July 1, we may earn Floor Income to the next reset date. In accordance with legislation enacted in 2006, holders of FFELP Loans are required to rebate Floor Income to ED for all FFELP Loans disbursed on or after April 1, 2006.\nFloor Income can be volatile as market rates and the rates on the underlying education loans move up and down. Subject to prevailing market conditions, we generally hedge this risk by using derivatives in an effort to lock in a portion of our Floor Income over the term of the contract. A rise in interest rates will reduce the amount of Floor Income received on the FFELP Loans not presently hedged with derivatives, which will compress our net interest margins. Additionally, net interest margins can be negatively impacted by unusual variances between one-month and three-month LIBOR.\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs or limit our access to the capital markets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch rated our long-term unsecured debt below investment grade. In addition, the capital markets for sub-investment grade companies are not as liquid as those involving investment grade entities. These factors have resulted in a higher cost of funds for us and have caused our senior unsecured debt to trade with greater volatility.\nOur unsecured debt totaled $9.5 billion at December 31, 2019. We utilize the unsecured debt markets to help fund our business and refinance outstanding debt. The amount, type and cost of this funding directly affects the cost of operating our business and growing our assets and is dependent upon outside factors, including our credit rating from rating agencies. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be reduced further. A reduction in the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt could adversely affect our liquidity, increase borrowing costs, limit access to the capital markets and place incremental pressure on net interest income.\nAdverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage our liquidity risk could negatively impact our ability to meet our liquidity and funding needs, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe must effectively manage our liquidity risk. We require liquidity to meet cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, required payments of principal and interest on borrowings, and distributions to stockholders. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the repayment of senior unsecured notes that mature in 2020, primarily through our current cash, investments and unencumbered FFELP Loan and Private Education Refinance Loan portfolios, the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities, the repayment of principal on unencumbered education loan assets, and the distribution of overcollateralization from our securitization trusts. We may also draw down on our secured FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan facilities, issue term ABS, enter into additional Private Education Loan ABS repurchase facilities to finance the Residual Interests in existing Private Education Loan ABS trusts or issue additional unsecured debt. we may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly, or may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during times of financial stress or capital market disruptions.\nThe interest rate characteristics of our earning assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of our funding arrangements, which may have a negative impact on our net interest income and net income.\nNet interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by our portfolios of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans. At the present, interest earned on FFELP Loans and variable rate Private Education Loans is primarily indexed to one-month LIBOR or Prime Rate, respectively, but our debt is primarily indexed to rates other than one-month LIBOR and Prime Rate.\nThe different interest rate characteristics of our loan portfolios and the liabilities funding these loan portfolios result in basis risk and repricing risk. It is not economically feasible to hedge all of our exposure to such risks. While the asset and hedge indices are short-term with rate movements that are typically highly correlated, there can be no assurance that the historically high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. There have been situations in the past in which we experienced widening spreads between one-month and three-month LIBOR and the cost of hedging this variance was prohibitive. We cannot provide any assurance that such a situation will not reoccur which will reduce our net interest margins and net income. In these circumstances, our earnings could be materially adversely affected.\nOur use of derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency sensitivity exposes us to credit and market risk that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and liquidity.\nWe strive to maintain an overall strategy that uses derivatives to minimize the economic effect of interest rate and/or foreign currency changes. However, developing an effective strategy for dealing with these movements is complex, and no strategy can completely avoid the risks associated with these fluctuations. For example, our education loan portfolio is subject to prepayment risk that could result in being under- or over-hedged, which could result in material losses. In addition, our use of derivatives in our risk management activities could expose us to mark-to-market losses if interest rates or foreign currencies move in a materially different way than was expected when we entered into the related derivative contracts. As a result, there can be no assurance that hedging activities using derivatives will effectively manage our interest rate or foreign currency sensitivity, have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition or not adversely impact our liquidity and earnings.\nOur use of derivatives also exposes us to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the chance of financial loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market liquidity. Our Floor Income Contracts and some of the basis swaps we use to manage earnings variability caused by different reset characteristics on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value, called the \u201cmark-to-market,\u201d of these derivative instruments is included in our statement of income without a corresponding mark-to-market of the economically hedged item. A decline in the fair value of these derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings. In addition, a change in the mark-to-market value of\nthese instruments may cause us to have to post more collateral to our counterparty or to a clearing house. If these values change significantly, the increased collateral posting requirement could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under a contract. Credit risk is limited to the loss of the fair value gain in a derivative that the counterparty or clearinghouse owes or will owe in the future to us. If a counterparty or clearinghouse fails to perform its obligations, we could, depending on the type of counterparty arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, we might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment.\nOur securitization trusts, which we consolidate on our balance sheet, had $4.0 billion of Euro and British Pound Sterling denominated bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2019. To convert these non-U.S. dollar denominated bonds into U.S. dollar liabilities, the trusts have entered into foreign-currency swaps with highly rated counterparties. A failure by a swap counterparty to perform its obligations could, if the swap has a positive fair value to us and was not adequately collateralized, materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nREGULATORY, COMPLIANCE & LEGAL RISK.\nOur businesses are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways, and changes to such laws and regulations or changes in existing regulatory guidance or their interpretation or enforcement could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that these laws, rules, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models or objectives or in ways that affect our returns on investment by restricting existing activities or services, change how our companies operate or the characteristics of our assets, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright.\nThe CFPB has authority with respect to our loan servicing business. It has authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to directly or indirectly enforce those laws and examine us for compliance. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority with respect to various federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, including us. New rules if implemented, could have a material effect on our loan servicing, consumer lending or asset recovery businesses and may result in significant capital expenditures to develop systems that enable us to comply with the new regulations.\nThe CFPB is authorized to impose monetary penalties, collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain, but it has resulted in, and could continue to result in, changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It has also resulted in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties.\nIn addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers State Attorneys General and state regulators, under certain circumstances to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more State Attorneys General or state regulators believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on us or our business. Since the CFPB filed its action against us in January of 2017, the Attorneys General of Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, Mississippi and California have filed separate actions alleging various violations of state and federal consumer protection laws.\nLoans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Our servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however, ED could determine that we are not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that we misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of our right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and/or the loss of our ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur businesses are also subject to regulation and oversight by various state and federal agencies, particularly in the area of consumer protection, and is subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations. Several states have passed or proposed student loan servicing rules or legislation and several other have imposed license requirements.\nImposition of new laws, rules or regulations or the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, including litigation costs, and/or business sanctions including but not limited to termination or non-renewal of contracts.\nExpanded regulatory and governmental oversight of our businesses will increase our costs and risks.\nWe are now, and may in the future be subject, to inquiries and audits from state and federal regulators as well as litigation from private plaintiffs. In recent years, we have entered into consent orders and other settlements. We have provided monetary and other relief in connection with the resolution of some of these actions and settlements. We have also enhanced our procedures and controls, expanded the risk and control functions within each line of business, invested in technology and hired additional risk, control and compliance personnel.\nIf our risk and control procedures and processes fail to meet the heightened expectations of our regulators and other government agencies, we could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, provide additional monetary relief, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our financial results.\nWe expect heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions to continue for us and for the financial services industry as a whole. Such actions can have significant consequences for a financial institution such as ours, including loss of customers and business and the inability to operate certain businesses.\nDue to the uncertainty engendered by these new regulations, guidance and actions, coupled with the likelihood of additional changes or additions to the local, state and federal statutes, regulations and practices applicable to our business, we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of changes in law on our financial results, business operations or strategies. We believe that the cost of responding to and complying with these evolving laws and regulations, as well as any guidance from enforcement actions, will continue to increase, as will the risk of penalties and fines from any enforcement actions that may be imposed on our businesses. Our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating the risk of loss.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and returns. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, control and report the types of risk to which we are subject. We seek to monitor and control risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, limits and reporting requirements. Management of risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. If the models we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate risks, we could suffer unexpected losses, and our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and some of these legal proceedings or other contingencies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal proceedings in virtually every part of our business, including the legal proceedings described in the Legal Proceedings section of this Annual Report. While we believe we have adopted appropriate legal and risk management and compliance programs, the diverse nature of our operations, including operations of business we have recently acquired, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. Some of these legal proceedings or other contingencies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations.\nIncorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our reported assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management could adversely affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If we make incorrect assumptions or estimates, our reported financial results may be over or understated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nIf we do not effectively and continually align our cost structure with our business operations, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe continually need to align our cost structure with our business operations. The ability to properly size our cost structure is dependent upon a number of variables, including our ability to successfully execute on our business plans and growth initiatives and future legislative or regulatory changes. If we undertake cost reductions based on our business plan, those reductions could be too dramatic and could cause disruptions in our business, reductions in the quality of the services we provide or cause us to fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Alternatively, we may fail to implement, or be unable to achieve, necessary cost savings commensurate with our business and prospects. In either case, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action or damage our reputation.\nA failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business. Our business is dependent on the ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with contractual, legal and regulatory standards and our own product specifications, both currently and in the future. In 2018, we entered into a strategic agreement with First Data, now part of Fiserv, to become the primary provider of technology solutions for servicing our federal education loans in addition to the technology role they already played with respect to Private Education Loans. We, however, still maintain the technology solutions for our other lines of business as well as our customer interactive infrastructure. As our processing demands and loan portfolios change, both in volume and in terms and conditions, our ability to develop and maintain our operating systems and infrastructure may become increasingly challenging. There is no assurance that we have adequately or efficiently developed, maintained, acquired or scaled such systems and infrastructure or will do so in the future.\nThe servicing, financial, accounting, data processing and other operating systems and facilities that support our business may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to timely process transactions. Any such failure could adversely affect our ability to service our clients and result in financial loss or liability to our clients, disrupt our business, and result in regulatory action or cause reputational damage.\nDespite the plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, Internet, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business. Notwithstanding efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting our processing locations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on secure information technology, and a breach of our information technology systems could result in significant losses, disclosure of confidential customer information and reputational damage, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures we deem reasonable and appropriate, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond our control. These technologies, systems and networks, and those of third parties, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our business operations or those of our customers or other third parties. Information security risks for institutions that handle large numbers of financial transactions on a daily basis such as Navient have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. In addition, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, and any failure by mobile or cloud technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information. Moreover, the loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation, result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers and subject us to liability under state, federal and international laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenues and substantial penalties. The recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect in January 2020 and provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents and statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations.\nIf one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks could be jeopardized or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations that could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information, some of it through third parties. We maintain secure\ntransmission capability and work to ensure that third parties follow similar procedures. Nevertheless, an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. In the event personal, confidential or other information is jeopardized, intercepted, misused or mishandled, we may need to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation and settlement costs and financial losses that may either not be insured against or not be fully covered through insurance. If one or more of such events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe depend on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications, and a breach or violation of law by one of these third parties could disrupt our business or provide our competitors with an opportunity to enhance their position at our expense.\nWe depend on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications. Third-party vendors are significantly involved in many aspects of our software and systems development, servicing systems, the timely transmission of information across our data communication network, and for other telecommunications, processing, remittance and technology-related services in connection with our servicing or payment services businesses. In addition to technology applications, we also utilize various third-party debt collectors in the collection of defaulted Private Education Loans and in other areas. If a service provider fails to provide the services required or expected, or fails to meet applicable contractual or regulatory requirements such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to process customers\u2019 transactions in a timely and accurate manner, otherwise hampering our ability to serve our customers, or subjecting us to litigation and regulatory risk for matters as diverse as poor vendor oversight or improper release or protection of personal information. Such a failure could also adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and services and the quality of our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.\nOur clients include federal, state and local governmental entities. This work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nGovernment contractors are sometimes affected by the political or budgetary processes of the United States government. Sometimes the political process leads to government shutdown of all parts of the federal or state government. This can lead to temporary work stoppages or payment delays. Contracts may be cancelled or altered due to political or policy priorities.\n\u2022\nGovernment entities in the United States often reserve the right to audit contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of business practices. These entities also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding systems, including systems of third parties, used in connection with the performance of the contracts. Negative findings from audits, investigations or inquiries could affect the contractor\u2019s future revenues and profitability by preventing them, by operation of law or in practice, (i) from receiving new government contracts for some period of time or (ii) from being paid at the rate they believe is warranted.\n\u2022\nIf improper or illegal activities are found in the course of government audits or investigations, the contractor may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act. Additionally, we may be subject to administrative sanctions, which may include termination or non-renewal of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. Due to the inherent limitations of internal controls, it may not be possible to detect or prevent all improper or illegal activities.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business or potential future business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is very high. We must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve our clients, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments, and grow and manage our business. As our business evolves, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals\nwith different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained. If we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism, including a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal.\nWe have been and may continue to be the subject of actions taken by activist stockholders. In 2019, an activist stockholder sought to nominate four director candidates to stand for election as directors at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. While we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our stockholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all stockholders, we may be subject to actions or proposals from other activist stockholders that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, or divert the attention of our board of directors, management, and employees from the pursuit of our business strategies. In 2019, we incurred $13 million in expenses as a result of the activist stockholder. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nEven if we are successful in a proxy contest or in defending against any unsolicited takeover attempt, our business could be adversely affected by any such proxy contest or unsolicited takeover attempt because:\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners\u037e\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected or appointed to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders\u037e and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected or appointed to our board of directors who do not agree with our strategic plan, the ability of our board of directors to function effectively could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainties related to, or the results of, such actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing actions by stockholders or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, and any of these matters or any further actions by this or other stockholders may impact and result in volatility or stagnation of the price of our stock.\nREPUTATIONAL/POLITICAL RISK.\nFederal funding constraints and spending policy changes triggered by associated federal spending deadlines and ongoing lawmaker and regulatory efforts to change the student lending sector may result in disruption of federal payments for services we provide to the government, which could materially and adversely affect our business strategy or future business prospects.\nWe receive payments from the federal government on our FFELP Loan portfolio and for other services it provides, including servicing loans under the Direct Student Loan Program (\u201cDSLP\u201d), providing default aversion and contingency collections to ED, and providing performance-based services to the IRS to support its national recovery program. Payments for these services may be affected by various factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe Budget Act: The Budget Act enacted on December 26, 2013, Direct Loan Servicing eliminated funding for the Direct Loan servicing performed by not-for-profit servicers. The Budget Act also requires that all servicing funding be provided through the annual appropriations process which is subject to certain limitations. Although the payments for our DSLP servicing contract are already funded from annual appropriations, the requirement to fund all servicing from the limited appropriated funding could have an effect on our future business in ways we cannot predict at this time.\n\u2022\nOther Higher Education Legislation: As Congress and the current Administration consider the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, they may consider legislation that would reduce the payments to Guarantors or change the consolidation program in a way that would incentivize education loan borrowers to refinance their existing education loans, both private and federal. Such reforms could reduce our cash flows from servicing and interest income as well as our net interest margin.\nED has also announced its intention to replace the current servicing contracts with various third parties including our Direct Loan servicing contract. In late 2019, ED informed us and other student loan servicers that these contracts\nwere renewed for an additional one-year period with two 6-month extension options while the procurement for replacement services continues.\nIt is possible that the administration and Congress in the future could engage in a prolonged debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations, including those on services we provide. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could impose proposals that would adversely affect FFELP and DSLP-related servicing businesses. A protracted reduction, suspension or cancellation of the demand for the services we provide, or proposed changes to the terms or pricing of services provided under existing contracts with the federal government, including our contract with ED, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, profitability and business outlook, and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by any actions that the Administration, Congress or the federal government may take.\nChanges in laws, rules or regulations may have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or businesses. Many of our businesses operate in highly regulated industries and are subject to various laws, rules or regulations. We are also subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions, both federal and state. Any changes to these laws, rules or regulations could have material impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand.\nNegative public opinion or damage to our brand could occur as a result of actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, security breaches (including the use and protection of customer information), corporate governance, and sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct. Such conduct could fall short of our customers\u2019 and the public\u2019s heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous data, privacy and compliance practices, and could further harm our reputation. In addition, third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SPIN-OFF.\nNavient owes obligations, including service and indemnification obligations, to SLM BankCo under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Spin-Off. These obligations could be materially disruptive to Navient\u2019s business or subject it to substantial liabilities, including contingent liabilities and liabilities that are presently unknown.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off from SLM BankCo, Navient, SLM Corporation and SLM BankCo entered into various agreements.\nThe separation and distribution agreement between Navient, SLM Corporation and SLM BankCo provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make Navient financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-Off, relating to the business activities of SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off, other than those arising out of the consumer banking business and expressly assumed by SLM BankCo in the separation and distribution agreement. If Navient is required to indemnify SLM BankCo under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Navient may be subject to substantial liabilities including liabilities that are accrued, contingent or otherwise and regardless of whether the liabilities were known or unknown at the time of the Spin-Off. SLM BankCo is party to various claims, litigation and legal, regulatory and other proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to its current and former operations. Previous business activities of SLM BankCo, including originations and acquisitions of various classes of consumer loans outside of Sallie Mae Bank, may also result in liability due to future laws, rules, interpretations or court decisions which purport to have retroactive effect, and such liability could be significant. SLM BankCo may also be subject to liabilities related to past activities of acquired businesses. It is inherently difficult, and in some cases impossible, to estimate the probable losses associated with contingent and unknown liabilities of this nature, but future losses may be substantial and may be borne by Navient in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.\nGOVERNANCE RISK.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated by-laws are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by, among other things, encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate directly with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting such that stockholder-requested special meetings will only be called upon the request of the holders of at least one-third of ours capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote thereon is required for stockholders to amend our amended and restated by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation makes it subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 generally provides that, with limited exceptions, persons who acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the time at which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock. Being subject to Section 203 could cause a delay in or completely prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including future equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. If made, these awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors generally may determine the rights of preferred stockholders including their powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions. If our board were to approve the issuance of preferred stock in the future, the terms of one or more series of such preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all circumstances or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, we could grant the preferred stockholders certain repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that could affect the value of the common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our shareholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a shareholder in our company, holders of our common stock will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum\nprovision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nSTRATEGIC RISK.\nLegislation passed by Congress in 2010 ended new loan originations under the FFELP program and no new FFELP Loans are being originated, and, as a result, net income on our existing FFELP Loan portfolio is declining over time. We may not be able to develop revenue streams to fully replace the declining revenue from FFELP Loans.\nIn 2010, Congress passed legislation ending the origination of education loans under the FFELP program. Since then, all federal education loans have been originated through the DSLP of the ED. While the 2010 law did not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP Loans, it significantly impacted the education loan industry. As a result of this legislation, net income on our FFELP Loan portfolio is anticipated to decline over time as those existing FFELP Loans are paid down, refinanced or repaid after default.\nAcquisitions or strategic investments that we pursue may not be successful and could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy has included making opportunistic acquisitions of, or material investments in, loan portfolios and complementary businesses and products.\nAll acquisitions of companies, operations or loan portfolios involve financial risks as well as operational risks. There may be additional risks if we enter into a line of business in which we have limited experience or which operates in a legal, regulatory or competitive environment with which we are not familiar. The expected benefits of acquisitions and investments also may not be realized for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel, customers or vendors. If we fail to integrate or realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions or investments, we may lose the return on these acquisitions or investments or incur additional transaction costs, and our business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.\nOur businesses operate in competitive environments and could lose market share and revenues if competitors compete more aggressively or effectively.\nWe compete with for-profit and not-for-profit servicing, asset recovery and business processing businesses, many with strong records of performance. We compete based on price, effectiveness and customer service metrics. To the extent our competitors compete aggressively or more effectively than us, we could lose market share to them or Our service offerings may not prove to be profitable. Our business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.", "PERMNO": 66325, "SIC": 6111, "TIC": "NAVI"}
