Risk Factors\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our goals. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may ultimately materially affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are among the items we have identified that could materially adversely affect our business, production, strategy, growth plans, acquisitions, hedging, reserves quantities or value, operating or capital costs, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, our ability to meet our capital expenditure plans, our plans to return capital and other obligations and financial commitments.\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile and directly affect our results.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital, rate of growth and the carrying value of our properties. Prices for these commodities have, and may continue to, fluctuate widely in response to market uncertainty and to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. For example, Brent crude oil contract prices ranged during 2018 from $62.59 per Bbl at the beginning, to a high of $86.29 per Bbl and back to $50.47 per Bbl at the end of the year. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas also fluctuated during 2018 between $2.55 per MMBtu and $3.23 per MMBtu and are currently higher in markets where we purchase gas. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control, which include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for, and transportation costs of, oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports of oil;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in, or affecting, other producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration, development and production, and resulting inventories;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nactions of other significant producers;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances, conservation efforts and availability of alternative fuels affecting oil and gas consumption;\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u2022\nrefining and processing disruptions or bottlenecks;\n\u2022\nthe impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future oil and gas prices; and\n\u2022\nForeign and U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulation and taxes, including the recent relaxation of U.S. export restrictions.\nLower oil prices may reduce our cash flow and borrowing ability. If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to develop future reserves could be adversely affected.\nAlso, lower prices generally adversely affect the quantity of our reserves as those reserves expected to be produced in later years, which tend to be costlier on a per unit basis, become uneconomic. However, increased gas prices could negatively impact our oil reserves to the extent it made them more costly to extract. In addition, a portion of our PUDs may no longer meet the economic producibility criteria under the applicable rules or may be removed due to a lower amount of capital available to develop these projects within the SEC-mandated five-year limit.\nIn addition, sustained periods with oil and natural gas prices at levels lower than current prices also may adversely affect our drilling economics, which may require us to postpone or eliminate all or part of our development program, and result in the reduction of some of our proved undeveloped reserves, which would reduce the net present value of our reserves.\nOur business requires continual capital expenditures. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital program is also susceptible to risks, including regulatory and permitting risks, that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make capital expenditures for the development and exploration of our oil and natural gas reserves. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of permits and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction or sustained decline in commodity prices from current levels may force us to reduce our capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. We have a 2019 capital expenditure budget of approximately $195 million to $225 million. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash flows from our operations; however, our cash flows from operations, and access to capital should such cash flows prove inadequate, are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nthe volume of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold and our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe success of our hedging program;\n\u2022\nour proved reserves, including our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under the RBL Facility;\n\u2022\nand our ability to access the capital markets.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the RBL Facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital were needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are able to obtain debt financing, it would require that a portion of our cash flows from operations be used to service such indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. If cash flows generated by our operations or available borrowings under the RBL Facility were not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\ndevelopment of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient fixed-price purchase or other hedging agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels.\nThe development of our heavy oil in California is subject to our ability to generate sufficient quantities of steam using natural gas at an economically effective cost. As a result, we need access to natural gas at prices sufficiently lower than oil prices on an energy equivalent basis to economically produce our heavy oil. We seek to reduce our exposure to the potential unavailability of, pricing increases for, and volatility in pricing of, natural gas by entering into fixed-price purchase agreements and other hedging transactions. We may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient such agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels. Our hedges are based on major oil and gas indexes, which may not fully reflect the prices we realize locally. Consequently, the price protection we receive may not fully offset local price declines.\nWe may be unable to hedge anticipated production volumes on attractive terms or at all, which would subject us to further potential commodity price uncertainty and could adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations, and our commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have hedged crude oil production at the following approximate volumes and prices: 17.5 MBbl/d at $70 per barrel in 2019, and 1.2 MBbl/d at $65 per barrel in 2020. In the future, we may be unable to hedge anticipated production volumes on attractive terms or at all, which would subject us to further potential commodity price uncertainty and could adversely affect our net cash provided by operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current commodity-price risk-management activities may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels determined under the derivative instruments we use to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; and\n\u2022\nan event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices in the opposite direction of our derivative positions.\nOur business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change legal requirements governing our operations, including well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the exploration and development of our properties, as well as the production, transportation, marketing and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. In addition, certain of these laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters\u201d for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, fluid injection and disposal, stimulation, operation, maintenance, transportation, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment and water recycling and reuse. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which could in certain cases delay or halt projects, production of wells and other operations. Additionally, failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations.\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Such restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species or their habitat could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers are also highly regulated. For example, federal and state pipeline safety agencies have adopted or proposed regulations to expand their jurisdiction to include more gas and liquid gathering lines and pipelines and to impose additional mechanical integrity requirements. The State of California has adopted additional regulations on the storage of natural gas that could affect the demand or availability of such storage, increase seasonal volatility, or otherwise affect the prices we pay for fuel gas.\nCosts of compliance may increase, and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past. For example, our costs have recently begun to increase due to increased fluid injection regulation and idle well decommissioning. In addition, we may experience delays, as we have in the past, due to personnel resource constraints at regulatory agencies that impede their ability to process permits in a timely manner that aligns with our production projects.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and natural gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. Government authorities have also adopted or proposed new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and natural gas operations. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, and preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nEstimation of reserves and related future net cash flows is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas that includes many uncertainties. Our estimates are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, including:\n\u2022\nthe similarity of reservoir performance in other areas to expected performance from our assets;\n\u2022\nthe quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices (see \u201c-Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile and directly affect our results.\u201d);\n\u2022\nproduction and operating costs;\n\u2022\nad valorem, excise, and income taxes and costs related to GHG regulations;\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture workover and asset retirement costs.\nMisunderstanding these variables, inaccurate assumptions, changed circumstances or new information could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions.\nWe currently expect improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and, potentially acquisitions, to be our main sources for reserves additions. However, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates could materially affect the net present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our borrowing base and liquidity under the RBL Facility, as well as our results of operations.\nUnless we replace oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Reduced capital expenditures may result in a decline in our reserves. Our ability to make the necessary long-term capital expenditures or acquisitions needed to maintain or expand our reserves may be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations or external sources of capital are insufficient. We may not be successful in developing, exploring for or acquiring additional reserves. Over the long-term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, production and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable or economically desirable oil and natural gas production or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves due to:\n\u2022\npoor production response;\n\u2022\nineffective application of recovery techniques;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, maintaining and abandoning wells; and\n\u2022\ndelays or cost overruns caused by equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes and other matters.\nOur decisions to develop or purchase prospects or properties will depend, in part, on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations as well as the uncertainties of drilling noted above. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \u201c-Estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\u201d\nFurther, many additional factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects and ongoing operations, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by, or resulting from, compliance with regulatory requirements, including limitations on water disposal, emission of GHGs, steam injection and well stimulation;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for steam used in production or pressure maintenance;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines; and\n\u2022\nother market limitations in our industry.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to property, reserves and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination and regulatory penalties.\nWe may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. We make assumptions that may prove inaccurate about the consistency and accuracy of data when we identify these locations. We cannot guarantee that these prospective drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could expire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented approximately 5% of our total net acreage at December 31, 2018.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. In addition, potential future legislation may generally affect the taxation of natural gas and oil exploration and development companies, and may adversely affect our operations.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies. Such legislative proposals have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The future passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and natural gas development or otherwise significantly increase our costs.\nFurthermore, in California, there have been, and currently are, proposals for new taxes on oil and natural gas production. Although the proposals have not become law, campaigns by various special interest groups could lead to future additional oil and natural gas severance or other taxes. The imposition of such taxes could significantly reduce our profit margins and cash flow and otherwise significantly increase our costs.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to evaluate, select and acquire suitable properties for acquisitions, market our production and secure skilled personnel to operate our assets in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do. In California, where we have the most experience operating, we have few competitors. However, most are larger than us. Our competitors may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has historically continually increased due to competition and may increase substantially in the future.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets or enter into attractive joint ventures, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nThere is no guarantee we will be able to identify or complete attractive acquisitions. Our capital expenditure budget for 2019 does not allocate any amounts for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties. If we make acquisitions, we would need to use cash flows or seek additional capital, both of which are subject to variables discussed in this section. Competition may also increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our debt arrangements impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions and to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to acquire assets and businesses. See \u201c-Our existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities.\u201d In addition, the success of completed acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources.\nWe are dependent on our cogeneration facilities to produce steam for our operations. Viable contracts for the sale of surplus electricity, economic market prices and regulatory conditions affect the economic value of these facilities to our operations.\nWe are dependent on five cogeneration facilities that, combined, provide approximately 24% of our steam capacity and approximately 63% of our field electricity needs in California at a discount to market rates. To further offset our costs, we sell surplus power to California utility companies produced by three of our cogeneration facilities under long-term contracts. These facilities are dependent on viable contracts for the sale of electricity. Should we lose, be unable to renew on favorable terms, or be unable to replace such contracts, we may be unable to realize the cost offset currently received. Furthermore, market fluctuations in electricity prices and regulatory changes in California could adversely affect the economics of our cogeneration facilities and any corresponding increase in the price of steam could significantly impact our operating costs. If we were unable to find new or replacement steam sources, lose existing sources or experience installation delays, we may be unable to maximize production from our heavy oil assets. If we were to lose our electricity sources, we would be subject to the electricity rates we could negotiate . For a more detailed discussion of our electricity sales contracts, see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Operational Overview-Electricity.\u201d\nOur existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nThe RBL Facility and the indenture governing our 2026 Notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. These agreements contain covenants, that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments (including certain loans to others);\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022\nmake dividends and certain other payments in respect of our equity;\n\u2022\nhedge future production or interest rates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens that secure indebtedness or certain other obligations;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nrepay or prepay certain indebtedness prior to the due date;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIn addition, the RBL Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios, which may limit our ability to borrow funds to withstand a future downturn in our business, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of these limitations.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nThe borrowing base under the RBL Facility is subject to periodic redetermination.\nThe amount available to be borrowed under the RBL Facility is subject to a borrowing base and will be redetermined semiannually on or about each May 1 and November 1 and will depend on the volumes of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated cash flows from these reserves and other information deemed relevant by the administrative agent of, or two-thirds of the lenders under, the RBL Facility. We, and the administrative agent and lenders, each may request one additional redetermination between each regularly scheduled redetermination. Furthermore, our borrowing base is subject to automatic reductions due to certain asset sales and hedge terminations, the incurrence of certain other debt and other events as provided in the RBL Facility. For example, the RBL Facility currently provides that to the extent we incur certain unsecured indebtedness, our borrowing base will be reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the amount of such unsecured debt that exceeds the amount, if any, of certain other debt that is being refinanced by such unsecured debt. We could be required to repay a portion of the RBL Facility to the extent that after a redetermination our outstanding borrowings at such time exceed the redetermined borrowing base. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments, which could result in a default under the terms of the facility and an acceleration of the loans outstanding under the facility, requiring us to negotiate renewals, arrange new financing or sell significant assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt arrangements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors that may be beyond our control. If oil and natural gas prices were to deteriorate and remain at low levels for an extended period of time, our cash flows from operating activities may be insufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness would depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, including the view of the markets of our credit risk after recent defaults. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with new covenants that further restrict business operations and opportunities. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes currently restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nFuture declines in commodity prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. We evaluate the impairment of our oil and natural gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nprospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $1.0 billion.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations or the loss of any one of our major oil and natural gas purchasers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant concentrations of credit risk with the purchasers of our oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Andeavor, Phillips 66 and Kern Oil & Refining accounted for approximately 35%, 28% and 13% respectively, of our sales.\nDue to the terms of supply agreements with our customers, we may not know that a customer is unable to make payment to us until almost two months after production has been delivered. This concentration of purchasers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions or commodity price fluctuations. We do not require our customers to post collateral. If the purchasers of our oil and natural gas become insolvent, we may be unable to collect amounts owed to us.\nAlso due to this significant customer concentration, if we were to lose any one of our major purchasers, the loss could cause us to cease or delay both production and sale of our oil and natural gas in the area supplying that purchaser.\nOur producing properties are located primarily in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nWe operate primarily in California. Because of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately influenced by conditions there. These conditions include local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations affecting our operations, political risks, limited acquisition opportunities where we have the most operating experience and infrastructure and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and transportation capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. For a discussion of regulatory risks, see \u201c-Our business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change legal requirements governing our operations, including well stimulation, enhanced production techniques and fluid injection or disposal, that could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy.\u201d The concentration of our operations in California and limited local storage options also increase our exposure to events such as natural disasters, including wildfires, mechanical failures, industrial accidents or labor difficulties.\nOperational issues and inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise could restrict access to markets for the commodities we produce.\nOur ability to market our production of oil, gas and NGLs depends on a number of factors, including the proximity of production fields to pipelines, refineries and terminal facilities, competition for capacity on such facilities, refinery shutdowns and turnarounds and the ability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our production. If these facilities are unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely, and expect to rely in the future, on third party facilities for services such as storage, processing and transmission of our production. Our plans to develop and sell our reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. The amount of oil, gas and NGLs that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities, or lack of capacity on such facilities. If our access to markets for commodities we produce is restricted, our costs could increase and our expected production growth may be impaired.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIf our assets become subject to FERC regulation or federal, state or local regulations or policies change, or if we fail to comply with market behavior rules, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur gathering and transportation operations are exempt from regulation by FERC, under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC- regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or Congress. If the FERC were to determine that one of our facilities or the services it provides were not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation, which could decrease revenue, increase operating costs and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Should we fail to comply with any applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. The FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and NGPA to impose penalties for current violations in excess of $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation.\nMoreover, FERC regulations indirectly impact our businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC\u2019s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, market manipulation, ratemaking, gas quality, capacity release and market center promotion, indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas market.\nIn addition, State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take and common purchaser requirements, as well as complaint-based rate regulation. Other state regulations may not directly apply to our business, but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas for purchase, compression and sale.\nFor more information regarding federal and state regulation of our operations, please see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nDerivatives legislation and regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may hold and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to, or otherwise be affected by, such regulations. Even though certain of the European Union implementing regulations have become effective, the ultimate effect on our business of the European Union implementing regulations (including future implementing rules and regulations) remains uncertain.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nConcerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect our operations or results.\nConcerns about climate change and regulation of GHGs and other air quality issues may materially affect our business in many ways, including by increasing the costs to provide our products and services, and reducing demand for, and consumption of, the oil and gas we produce. We may be unable to recover or pass through all or any of these costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses to such issues may increase our operating costs and render certain wells or projects uneconomic. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could adversely impact our cost of, and access to, capital. Both California and the EPA have adopted laws and policies that seek to reduce GHG emissions as discussed in \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters-Climate Change\u201d and \u201c-California GHG Regulations.\u201d Compliance with California cap-and-trade program laws and regulations could significantly increase our capital, compliance and operating costs and could also reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. The cost of acquiring GHG emissions allowances will depend on the market price for such instruments at the time they are purchased, the distribution of cost-free allowances among various industry sectors by the California Air Resources Board, and our ability to limit GHG emissions and implement cost-containment measures. In addition, on September 10, 2018, the Governor of California signed into law a bill that would commit California to the use of 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045. The same day, the Governor also signed an executive order committing California to total economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. While the law does not directly affect the oil and gas industry, and it remains unclear what actions state agencies may take in response to the executive order, these recent actions could result in decreased future demand for the oil and gas we produce and in turn have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, other current and proposed international agreements and federal and state laws, regulations and policies seek to restrict or reduce the use of petroleum products in transportation fuels and electricity generation, impose additional taxes and costs on producers and consumers of petroleum products, and require or subsidize the use of renewable energy. For example, the International Maritime Organization has imposed global sulfur caps on ships sailing in emissions control areas, which are set to take effect by January 2020, and may decrease demand, or the prices we can obtain, for our products.\nGovernmental authorities can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d) and associated state laws and regulations. For example, the San Joaquin Valley will be required to adopt more rigorous attainment plans under the CAA to comply with federal ozone and particulate matter standards, and these efforts could affect our activities in the region. In addition, California air quality laws and regulations, particularly in southern and central California where most of our operations are located, are in most instances more stringent than analogous federal laws and regulations.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well drilling, completion, stimulation, maintenance, water disposal, marketing and transportation and abandonment activities, are subject to operational risks such as fires, explosions, oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment, equipment failures and industrial accidents. We are exposed to similar risks indirectly through our customers and other market participants such as refiners. Other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, fires, droughts, terrorist attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may adversely affect our business and the communities in which we operate. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and natural gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nbe predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have a material adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of the attention of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, loss of contractual or other rights, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient, and judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change materially from one period to the next.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on, and could be deprived of, the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of services of any of these individuals.\nInformation technology failures and cyberattacks could affect us significantly.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our operations and prepare our financial management and reporting information. If we record inaccurate data or experience infrastructure outages, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations. If we were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our business and the communities in which we operate could be significant and could harm our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nRisks Related to Emergence\nOur financial condition or results of operations are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements.\nSince February 28, 2017, we have been operating under a new capital structure. In addition, we adopted fresh-start accounting and, as a result, at February 28, 2017 our assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value, which resulted in values that are materially different than the values that were recorded in our historical financial statements. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations from and after the Effective Date are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nDue to our limited operating history as an independent company following our emergence from bankruptcy in February 2017, we have been in the process of establishing our accounting and other management systems and resources. We may be unable to effectively complete the development of a mature system of internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company.\nOur predecessor company was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Linn Energy, and we utilized Linn Energy\u2019s systems, software and personnel to prepare our financial information and to ensure that adequate internal controls over financial reporting were in place. Following our emergence from bankruptcy in February 2017, we assumed responsibility for these functions. In the course of transitioning these functions, we put in place a new executive management team and continue to add personnel, upgrade our systems, including information technology, and implement additional financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. These activities place\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nsignificant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources, and involve risks relating to our failure to manage this transition adequately.\nProper systems of internal controls over financial accounting and disclosure controls and procedures are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively complete the development of a mature system of internal controls, we may be unable to continue reliably assimilating and compiling financial information about our company, which would significantly impair our ability to prevent error, detect fraud or access capital markets.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business plan and our long-term viability cannot be assured.\nOur prospects for financial success are difficult to assess because we have a limited operating history since emergence from bankruptcy. There can be no assurance that our business will be successful, that we will be able to maintain a profitable operation, or that we will not encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. There can be no assurance that we will sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nA large portion of our common stock is beneficially owned by a relatively small number of stockholders. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures, hostile takeovers or other transactions, including the payment of dividends or the issuance of additional equity or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or in another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholder concentrations.\nOur significant stockholders and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation could enable our significant stockholders to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that our stockholders and their affiliates are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Berry Corp. (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), among other things:\n\u2022\npermits stockholders to make investments in competing businesses; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if one of our directors who is also an employee, officer or director of a stockholder (a \u201cDual Role Person\u201d), becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nOur director who is a Dual Role Person may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which our stockholders have invested, in which case we may not become aware of, or otherwise have the ability to pursue, such opportunity.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nFurther, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to be unavailable to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, our stockholders and their affiliates may dispose of oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. Our business and prospects could be adversely affected if attractive business opportunities are procured by our stockholders for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nCertain of our stockholders and their affiliates have resources greater than ours, which may make it more difficult for us to compete with such persons with respect to commercial activities as well as for potential acquisitions. As a result, competition from certain stockholders and their affiliates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that Berry Corp.\u2019s authorized capital stock consists of 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In addition, we registered shares of the great majority of our common stock for resale and conditions limiting such resales expired January 21, 2019. The holders of those shares largely comprised creditors of Berry LLC prior to its bankruptcy and we cannot predict when or whether they will sell such shares. Such sales, or concerns about them, may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of any securities for acquisitions, financing, upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of our outstanding common stock. If we issue any such additional securities, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. We cannot predict the size of any future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock are also reserved for issuance as equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other persons under the Berry Petroleum Corporation 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (our \u201cRestated Incentive Plan\u201d). We have filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of shares of our common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our Restated Incentive Plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of certain lock-up agreements and the requirements of Rule 144, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 may be made available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. Investors may experience dilution in the value of their investment upon the exercise of any equity awards that may be granted or issued pursuant to the Restated Incentive Plan in the future.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and are able take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, including auditor attestation requirements or any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) as of the end of the fiscal year that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\n\u201cEmerging growth companies\u201d can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those companies who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nTo the extent investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced reporting and exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will incur significant costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nOur management and other personnel are required to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company requirements. After we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We currently do not have an internal audit function, and we have needed, and will continue to need, to hire or contract for additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nIf we do not adequately develop or maintain all required financial reporting and disclosure procedures and controls, we may be unable to provide the financial information required of a U.S. publicly traded company in a timely and reliable manner.\nAs a private company we were not required to adopt or maintain all of the financial reporting and disclosure procedures and controls required of a U.S. publicly traded company. If we fail to adequately develop and maintain effective internal controls and procedures and disclosure procedures and controls, we may be unable to provide the financial information and SEC reports that a U.S. publicly traded company is required to provide in a timely and reliable fashion. Any such delays or deficiencies could penalize us, including by limiting our ability to obtain financing, either in the public capital markets or from private sources and hurt our reputation and could thereby impede our ability to implement our growth strategy.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is not currently required to meet the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nin accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC after the consummation of the IPO, and generally requires a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which could be up to five years from our IPO.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard our assets, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, safeguard our assets or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nIn connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to timely remediate. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any remediation of control deficiencies and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Further, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nCertain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as our stockholders agreement, may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Form of the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws of Berry Corp. (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that (i) authorize our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval and (ii) establish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings. Additionally, we and many of the largest holders of our equity securities are bound by a stockholders agreement that requires us to nominate for election and take all other necessary actions to cause an individual designated by Benefit Street Partners to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the board of directors to be elected to the board of directors.\nThese provisions could enable the board of directors to delay or prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may discourage or prevent attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may also discourage or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\naction asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 17956, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BRY"}
