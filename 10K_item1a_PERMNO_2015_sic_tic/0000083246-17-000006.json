{"cik": "83246", "company": "HSBC USA INC /MD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion provides a description of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents. Some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses. There are also other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and, therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face.\nThe current uncertain market and economic conditions may continue to affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Our business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and market conditions in the United States and abroad. Uncertainties remain concerning the outlook and the future economic environment despite recent improvements in certain segments of the global economy. There can be no assurance that the global economy as a whole will improve significantly or at all. Given our concentration of business activities in the United States, we are particularly exposed to any additional turmoil in the economy, housing downturns, high unemployment, tighter credit conditions and reduced economic growth. While the U.S. economy continued its trend of slow growth during 2016, challenges remain. We also have a significant number of customers in Latin America and in particular Brazil, which continues to experience inflation and other economic challenges. In addition, although the price of oil increased in 2016, it remains depressed compared with historical levels in part due to the strong U.S. dollar, adding pressure to portfolios where the customer base is heavily centered in commodity-based businesses. General business, economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include:\n\u2022\nlevel of economic growth, including the pace and magnitude of such growth;\n\u2022\npressure on consumer confidence and consumer spending from other economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nfiscal policy;\n\u2022\nvolatility in energy prices, including oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\nvolatility in credit markets;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels;\n\u2022\ntrends in corporate earnings;\n\u2022\nwage income levels and declines in wealth;\n\u2022\nmarket value of residential and commercial real estate throughout the United States;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nmonetary supply and monetary policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets in which we fund our operations;\n\u2022\nconsequences of unexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, pandemics or acts of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\ntrade policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nmovements in short-term and long-term interest rates, a change in the shape of the yield curve or a prolonged period of low or negative interest rates;\n\u2022\navailability of liquidity;\n\u2022\ntight consumer credit conditions;\n\u2022\nbankruptcy filing levels and heightened scrutiny by various U.S. Bankruptcy Trustees of proofs of claim and other documents filed by creditors in consumer bankruptcy cases; and\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives.\nAlthough unemployment rates have improved in 2016 and housing market conditions in the U.S. continue to recover, if businesses were again to become cautious to hire, lay-off employees or reduce hours for employees, losses could be significant in all types of our consumer loans due to decreased consumer income. While the U.S. economy continued to improve in 2016, economic uncertainty remains high in many economies outside the U.S., including China as well as Latin America and in particular Brazil, where economic activity continues to be slow. In addition, the decision by the United Kingdom in late June to exit the EU as well as the new Administration in the U.S. could potentially impact the capital markets and trade further adding to this global uncertainty. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. In the event economic conditions stop improving or become depressed and lead to a recession, there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies, charge-offs and losses in all loan portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations. While the recovery may be positive in the United States, it can have a simultaneous negative effect on\nHSBC USA Inc.\ncurrencies and stock markets in emerging economies such as those in Latin America, which could have a negative impact on our loan portfolio for our Latin American clients, with a corresponding impact on our results of operations.\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels or increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our financial planning products and services.\nFederal, state, local and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment. Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting banking, derivatives, capital, liquidity, consumer credit, bankruptcy, privacy, consumer protection or other matters.\nAttempts by local, state and federal regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending and credit card industries could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of products we can offer, how these products may be originated, the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced. Any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results. There is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate loans. We cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies, state Attorneys General, or certain legislators, nor can we anticipate whether significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's potential expansion of the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in our consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries, including HSBC Bank USA, have registered as swap dealers and are now subject to extensive oversight by the CFTC. Regulation of swap dealers by the CFTC imposes numerous corporate governance, business conduct, capital, margin, reporting, clearing, execution and other regulatory requirements on HSBC Bank USA. Additionally, certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries, including HSBC Bank USA, may in the future be required to register as security-based swap dealers and become subject to extensive oversight by the SEC, including the imposition of parallel corporate governance, business conduct, reporting and other regulatory requirements for security-based swaps. Imposition of these requirements may adversely affect our derivatives business and make us less competitive or make certain derivative products less profitable to undertake. Although many significant regulations applicable to swap dealers are already in effect and have imposed significant costs on our derivatives business, we are still in the process of assessing the full impact of certain recently released requirements and the potential impact of future security-based swap requirements.\nIn 2013, U.S. regulatory agencies finalized the Volcker Rule, which limits the ability of banking entities such as HUSI to sponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds or engage in certain types of proprietary trading. The conformance period for the Volcker Rule was extended until July 21, 2015. The FRB further extended the conformance period to July 21, 2016 for investments in and relationships with \"covered funds\" and \"foreign funds,\" each as defined in the Volcker Rule, that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (\"legacy covered funds\"). In July 2016, the FRB granted an additional one year extension of the conformance period for legacy covered funds until July 21, 2017. The Volcker Rule requires extensive regulatory interpretation and subjects HUSI to further supervisory oversight by U.S. regulatory agencies. While the Volcker Rule contains exemptions for market-making, underwriting, risk-mitigating hedging, and certain transactions on behalf of customers and activities in certain asset classes, clearly defining all the parameters of these exemptions and requirements requires additional guidance and clarification from the U.S. regulatory agencies.\nThe Volcker Rule restricts proprietary trading as principal for a \"trading account\" in \"financial instruments,\" each as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to various exclusions and exemptions. Generally, securities, derivatives, futures and options on all such instruments are covered, while loans, currencies and commodities are not covered. In addition, there are exemptions for activities, among others, that constitute market making, underwriting, hedging, and trading of U.S. government, agency or municipal securities and certain foreign sovereign debt securities. Each of these exemptions, however, is generally subject to its own set of compliance requirements and conditions.\nThe Volcker Rule also restricts acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or sponsoring or having certain relationships with, covered funds. Covered funds generally include entities that would be an investment company under the 1940 Act, but for the exemptions provided in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, as well as certain commodity pools. The Volcker Rule includes exclusions and exemptions, among others, for certain limited investments in conjunction with asset management activities for customers, for loan securitizations, for asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and for underwriting and market making in covered funds. As with the proprietary trading restrictions, the exemptions are generally subject to a variety of compliance\nHSBC USA Inc.\nrequirements and conditions. Any limited, yet permissible, investments in covered funds are required to be deducted from the Tier 1 capital of U.S. banking entities. Several activities engaged in by HUSI and its affiliates and subsidiaries are subject to the restrictions under the Volcker Rule.\nThe Volcker Rule also requires an extensive array of compliance policies, procedures and quantitative metrics reporting to ensure that activities remain within one or more of the exemptions described in the Volcker Rule. In connection with these requirements, we have built a compliance framework designed to ensure compliance by the relevant effective dates. Compliance with the Volcker Rule will increase our operational and compliance costs, reduce our trading revenues, restrict certain activities and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe FRB has also adopted rules to implement certain enhanced supervisory and prudential requirements and the early remediation requirements established under the Dodd-Frank Act. The FRB adopted enhanced standards relating to risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management and stress test requirements. The FRB has also issued final rules requiring covered entities to undergo annual stress tests conducted by the FRB and conduct their own \"company-run\" stress tests twice a year in conjunction with the CCAR program. In March 2016, the FRB re-proposed limits on credit exposure to a single counterparty that would apply to HSBC North America and HSBC. Final regulations addressing early remediation requirements required by the Dodd-Frank Act also have not yet been adopted, and are likely to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us once they are finalized.\nOur parent, HSBC North America, is subject to assessment by the FRB as part of the CCAR program, which includes annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB and both HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA must conduct company-run stress tests as required under the DFAST. CCAR is an annual exercise by the FRB to ensure that institutions have forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their risks and sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. We cannot be certain that the FRB will have no objections to our 2017 or future capital plans submitted through the CCAR program, which is assessed by the FRB on both a quantitative and qualitative basis. If the FRB objects to our capital plan because we fail to meet either the quantitative or qualitative requirements, this could adversely affect our ability to make distributions, including dividends on our preferred stock, or to enter into acquisitions. We may fail to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests. If our stress testing projections differ significantly from our peers or the FRB objects to HSBC North America's capital plan, this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation since CCAR and DFAST results are made public. See also \"Our reputation has a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations\" below.\nThe total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will implement the Dodd-Frank Act through the promulgation of new regulations and revisions to existing regulations and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the EU and in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Regulators in the EU and in the United Kingdom are in the midst of proposing far-reaching programs of financial regulatory reform. These proposals include enhanced capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, changes in compensation practices (including tax levies), separation of retail and wholesale banking, the recovery and resolution of EU financial institutions, amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Market Abuse Directive, and measures to address systemic risk. Furthermore, certain large G-SIBs, including HSBC, will be subject to capital surcharges and other enhanced prudential requirements. While the FSB has identified HSBC as one of the two G-SIBs that would be subject to a 2 percent surcharge, the G-SIB surcharge will not apply in the United Kingdom until January 1, 2018. The FRB's rules implementing the G-SIB surcharge in the United States would not impose additional capital requirements on us because the U.S. G-SIB surcharge will only apply to the eight largest U.S. banking organizations.\nNotwithstanding the above, the new Administration has indicated it would like to see changes made to certain financial reform regulations, including Dodd-Frank, to replace certain elements with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation. The specifics of what might be changed are currently unclear, which has introduced some uncertainty about the regulatory framework that will apply to the financial services industry going forward.\nIn 2015, the FSB issued final standards for TLAC requirements for G-SIBs, which will apply to our ultimate parent HSBC once implemented in the United Kingdom. The new standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require \"internal\" TLAC to be prepositioned (i.e., issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties). The purpose of this new standard is to ensure that G-SIBs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability, and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution. The new standard calls for all G-SIBs to be subject to TLAC requirements starting January 1, 2019, and to be fully phased in by January 1, 2022. In the United States, the FRB adopted final rules implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the United States in December 2016. The rules require, among other things, the U.S. IHCs of non U.S. G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of TLAC which would include minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-\nHSBC USA Inc.\nterm debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019, without the benefit of a phase-in period. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America could engage in. The FSB's TLAC standard and the FRB's TLAC rules represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework that may require HSBC North America to issue additional long-term debt.\nThe implementation of regulations and rules promulgated by these bodies could result in additional costs or limit or restrict the way HSBC conducts its businesses in the EU and in the U.K. Furthermore, the potentially far-reaching effects of future changes in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement as a result of EU or U.K. legislation and regulation are difficult to predict and could adversely affect HSBC USA's operations.\nFailure to implement and adhere to our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement and related and other agreements and consent orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results and operations. An independent compliance monitor (the \"Monitor\") was appointed in 2013 under the 2012 agreements entered into with the DOJ and the FCA to produce annual assessments of the effectiveness of our AML and sanctions compliance program. Additionally, the Monitor is serving as HSBC's independent consultant under the consent order of the FRB. HSBC Bank USA is also subject to an agreement entered into with the OCC in December 2012, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Agreement and other consent orders.\nThe design and execution of AML and sanctions remediation plans to address the findings of the U.S. DPA and the Monitor are complex and require major investments in people, systems and other infrastructure. This complexity creates significant execution risk, which could affect our ability to effectively identify and manage financial crime risk and remedy AML and sanctions compliance deficiencies in a timely manner. This could, in turn, impact our ability to satisfy the Monitor or comply with the terms of the U.S. DPA and related agreements and consent orders, and may require us to take additional remedial measures in the future. These risks could be further heightened if the Monitor's reports were to become public.\nIn February 2017, the Monitor delivered his third annual follow-up review report based on various thematic and country reviews conducted over the course of 2016. In his report, the Monitor concluded that, in 2016, HSBC Group continued to make progress in enhancing its financial crime compliance controls, including improvements to our global AML policies and procedures. However, the Monitor also expressed significant concerns about the pace of that progress, instances of potential financial crime that the DOJ and HSBC are reviewing further and on-going systems and control deficiencies that in his view raised questions as to whether HSBC is adhering to its obligations under the U.S. DPA, a matter that would be determined by the DOJ in its sole discretion. The Monitor also found that there remain substantial challenges for HSBC to meet its goal of developing a reasonably effective and sustainable AML and sanctions compliance program. In addition, the Monitor did not certify as to HSBC Group's implementation of and adherence to remedial measures specified in the U.S. DPA.\nUnder the terms of the U.S. DPA, upon notice and an opportunity to be heard, the DOJ has sole discretion to determine whether HSBC or HSBC Bank USA has breached the U.S. DPA. As discussed in Note 27, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are the subject of other ongoing investigations and reviews by the DOJ. Potential consequences of breaching the U.S. DPA could include the imposition of additional terms and conditions on HSBC or HSBC Bank USA, an extension of the U.S. DPA, including its monitorship, or the criminal prosecution of HSBC and HSBC Bank USA, which could, in turn, entail further financial penalties and collateral consequences.\nBreach of the U.S. DPA or related or other agreements and consent orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, including loss of business and withdrawal of funding, restrictions on our ability to operate in the United States or to perform dollar-clearing functions through HSBC Bank USA, or revocation of bank licenses. Even if we are not determined to have breached these agreements, but the agreements are amended or their terms extended, our business, reputation and brand could suffer materially. Moreover, these consent orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies or private litigation.\nWe are not currently in full compliance with the AML/BSA consent order entered into by HSBC Bank USA with the OCC in 2010 (the \"AML/BSA Consent\"), which required improvements to establish an effective compliance risk management program across our U.S. businesses, including risk management related to BSA and AML compliance. Failure to comply with the AML/BSA Consent could result in additional restrictions on HSBC Bank USA that could be material to our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and could result in future enforcement actions, including the assessment of additional civil money penalties.\nThird parties may use us as a conduit for illegal activities without our knowledge, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with applicable AML laws and regulations and have adopted various policies and procedures, including internal control and 'know your customer' procedures, aimed at preventing the use of HSBC products and services for the purpose of committing or concealing financial crime. A major focus of U.S. and U.K. government policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and enforcing compliance with U.S. and EU economic sanctions, and this prioritization is evidenced by our agreements with U.S. and U.K. authorities relating to various investigations regarding past inadequate compliance with AML and sanctions laws. We and certain of our affiliates have entered into a consent\nHSBC USA Inc.\ncease and desist order with the OCC and a similar consent order with the FRB which require the implementation of improvements to compliance procedures regarding obligations under the BSA and AML rules. These consent orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies or private litigation.\nA number of the remedial actions taken or being taken as a result of the matters to which the U.S. DPA relates are intended to ensure that we and the other HSBC Group businesses are better protected from these risks. However, there can be no assurance that the steps that continue to be taken to address the requirements of the U.S. DPA will be completely effective. Breach of the U.S. DPA or related agreements and consent orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including loss of business and withdrawal of funding, restrictions on performing dollar-clearing functions through HSBC Bank USA or revocation of bank licenses.\nIn relevant situations, and where permitted by regulation, we may rely upon certain counterparties, including our affiliates, to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate AML procedures. While permitted by regulation, such reliance may not be effective in preventing third parties from using us (and our relevant counterparties) as a conduit for money laundering, including illegal cash operations without our knowledge (and that of our relevant counterparties). Becoming a party to money laundering, association with, or even accusations of being associated, with money laundering would damage our reputation and could make us subject to fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement (including being added to 'blacklists' that will prohibit certain parties from engaging in transactions with us). Any one of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the GLBA Agreement would have an adverse material effect on our results and operations. As reflected in the GLBA Agreement entered into with the OCC on December 11, 2012, the OCC has determined that HSBC Bank USA is not in compliance with the requirements set forth in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24a(a)(2)(c) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.39(g)(1), which provide that a national bank and each depository institution affiliate of the national bank must be both well capitalized and well managed in order to own or control a financial subsidiary. As a result, HSBC USA and its parent bank holding companies no longer meet the qualification requirements for financial holding company status and may not engage in any new types of financial activities without the prior approval of the FRB. In addition, HSBC Bank USA may not directly or indirectly acquire control of, or hold an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, nor commence a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, unless it receives prior approval from the OCC. If all of our affiliate depositary institutions are not in compliance with these requirements within the time periods specified in the GLBA Agreement, as they may be extended, HSBC USA could be required either to divest HSBC Bank USA or to divest or terminate any financial activities conducted in reliance on the GLB Act. Similar consequences could result for subsidiaries of HSBC Bank USA that engage in financial activities in reliance on expanded powers provided for in the GLB Act. Any such divestiture or termination of activities would have an adverse material effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results and operation.\nOur reputation may have a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations. Our ability to attract and retain customers and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation, or the reputation of affiliates operating under the HSBC brand, is damaged. Our failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nnegative news about us, HSBC, our affiliates or the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including potential conflicts of interest and the acceptance or receipt of gifts and entertainment, as well as potential violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\");\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nalleged deceptive or unfair lending or pricing practices;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering and economic sanctions programs;\n\u2022\nfraud and misappropriation of assets;\n\u2022\nprivacy and data security intrusions related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\nrecordkeeping;\n\u2022\nsales and trading practices;\n\u2022\ncustomer service;\n\u2022\nactions of a vendor or other third party, including a subcontractor, we do business with;\n\u2022\nthe proper identification of the legal, credit, liquidity, operational and market risks inherent in our businesses;\n\u2022\nalleged irregularities in servicing, foreclosure, consumer collections, mortgage lending practices and loan modifications;\n\u2022\na downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our credit ratings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral company performance.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nThe proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, facilitates communication with large audiences in short time frames. These social media websites, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets.\nThe failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address any of these issues appropriately could make our customers unwilling to do business with us or give rise to increased regulatory action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management measures may not be successful. The management of risk is an integral part of all our activities. Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. Risks have the potential to affect the results of our operations or financial condition. Specifically, risk equates to the adverse effect on profitability or financial condition arising from different sources of uncertainty including retail and wholesale credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk including legal, financial crime compliance, regulatory compliance, accounting, tax, fiduciary, information security, security fraud, people, systems, political contingency, projects, and operations risks, liquidity and funding risk, reputational risk, strategic risk, model risk, sustainability risk, and pension obligation risk. To manage risk, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. The framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It also strives to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While our risk management framework employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome. Failure to manage risks appropriately could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management measures may face particularly significant challenges in the following three broad areas:\n(a) Macroeconomic and geo-political risks: Current economic and market conditions may adversely affect our results. We may suffer adverse effects as a result of the renewed economic tensions in the euro-zone. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our results.\n(b) Risks related to our businesses, business operations, governance, and internal systems: The delivery of our strategic priorities is subject to execution risk and we may not achieve all the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives. Our operations are subject to the threat of fraudulent activity and disruption from the external environment. We are highly dependent on our information technology systems. We could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure. Issues with the quality of data or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting.\n(c) Regulatory and legal risks to our businesses: We are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, but unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and brand. Unfavorable legislative or regulatory developments, or changes in the policy of regulators or governments, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFailure to implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance. Our strategies for business growth includes focusing our sales efforts on international connectivity strategies with high quality internationally minded clients as well as augmenting our returns through increased cross-selling and cost optimization. The development and implementation of our strategy requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions in various parts of the world. We may fail to correctly identify the trends we seek to exploit and the relevant factors in making decisions as to capital deployment and cost reduction, and our ability to execute our strategy may also be limited by our operational capacity and the increasing complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate. Further, we may fail to attract internationally mobile clients or cross-sell our services to them. See \"-Our \"cross-selling\" efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results.\" The work required to execute on our growth strategies is substantial. Alongside the strategic actions, we continue to implement a number of externally driven regulatory remediation programs. The magnitude and complexity of the projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Additionally, we may be unable to fully realize the cost optimization efforts and the other anticipated benefits from our cost optimization efforts and we may not be able to realize them in the currently anticipated timeframes.\nThe cumulative impact of the collective change initiatives underway is significant and has direct implications on resourcing and our people. Our ability to execute our strategy may also be limited by our operational capacity and the increasing complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate. In addition, factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, the economic\nHSBC USA Inc.\nand market conditions and other challenges discussed in detail above, could limit our ability to achieve all of the expected benefits of these initiatives. Failure to successfully implement our business strategies may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur \"cross-selling\" efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results. Selling more products to our customers - \"cross-selling\" - is very important to our business model and key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings, especially during the current environment of slow economic growth and regulatory reform initiatives. Key among these cross-sell opportunities is the collaboration between CMB and GB&M, which is an area where many of our competitors also focus. In RBWM many of our competitors also focus on cross-selling, especially in retail banking and mortgage lending. In both instances, this can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net interest income and revenue from our fee-based products. It could also affect our ability to keep existing customers. New technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers. Our cross-sell strategy also is dependent on earning more business from our HSBC customers, and increasing our cross-sell ratio - or the average number of products sold to existing customers - may become more challenging.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. We are exposed to many types of operational risks that are inherent in banking operations, including fraudulent and other criminal activities (both internal and external), breakdowns in processes or procedures and systems failure or non-availability. For example, fraudsters may target any of our products, services and delivery channels including lending, internet banking, payments, bank accounts and cards. These risks apply equally when we rely on outside suppliers or vendors to provide services to us and our customers. These operational risks may result in financial loss to us, an adverse customer experience, reputational damage and potential regulatory action depending on the circumstances of the event, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, there is a risk that our operating system controls as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to disruption from the external environment. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems infrastructure arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include:\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, electrical, telecommunications, or other essential utility outages;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions and earthquakes;\n\u2022\nevents arising from local, regional or international politics, including terrorist acts; or\n\u2022\nabsence of operating systems personnel due to global pandemics or otherwise, which could have a significant effect on our business operations as well as on HSBC affiliates world-wide.\nSuch disruptions may give rise to losses in service or disruption to customers, an inability to collect our receivables in affected areas, physical damage or loss of life and other loss or liability to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nA failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. Data quality and integrity are critical for decision making, enterprise risk management and operational processes, as well as for complying with applicable regulation. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of complex transactions, most of which involve, in some fashion, networked computing devices. If any of our financial, accounting, data processing or other recordkeeping systems and management controls fail, or are subject to cyberattack that could compromise integrity, availability or confidentiality of our systems or data, we could be materially adversely affected.\nCybersecurity continues to be leveraged by cybercriminals to perpetrate crimes at an increasing rate, often exceeding traditional offense, and poses a significant threat to economic, social and geopolitical stability for private firms and countries. HSBC faces sophisticated cyberthreats from state-sponsored attackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and other threat actors seeking our critical corporate and customer information.\nIn recent years, distributed denial of service (\"DDoS\") attacks, spearphishing campaigns, advanced malware, ransomware attacks, social engineering and insider threats have grown in volume and level of sophistication each with the intent to obtain personal customer financial information or proprietary corporate information, disrupt availability of services and to commit fraud. Such acts can affect our business by:\n\u2022\ncompromising the confidentiality or integrity of our customers' data, potentially impacting our customers' ability to repay loan balances and negatively impacting their credit ratings;\nHSBC USA Inc.\n\u2022\ncompromising the security of and confidence in our payment channels;\n\u2022\nputting our customers at risk for identity theft, account takeover and credit abuse;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur remediation and other costs related to liability for customer or third parties for losses, repairs to remedy systems flaws, or incentives to customers and business partners to maintain and rebuild business relationships after the attack;\n\u2022\nincreasing our costs to respond to such threats and to enhance our processes and systems to ensure security of data;\n\u2022\ndamaging our reputation as a result of public disclosure of a breach of our systems or a loss of data event;\n\u2022\nresulting in unauthorized disclosure or alteration of our corporate confidential information and confidential information of employees, customers and counterparties;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our customers' or third parties' business operations; and\n\u2022\nresulting in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nThe threat from cyberattacks, on us and on third party vendors on which we rely, is a concern for our organization and failure to protect our operations from internet crime or cyberattacks may result in financial loss and loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine our reputation and our ability to attract and keep customers. We face various cyber risks in line with other multinational financial organizations. We and other multinational financial organizations have been, and will continue to be subject to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet and customers' use of personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access products and services to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime for seeking financial gain, hacktivists (geopolitical designated groups), cyberterrorists (attacks against critical infrastructure) and state sponsored advanced persistent threats, sometimes referred to as APTs, for corporate espionage. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, HSBC Group's prominent size and scale, geographical span and role in the financial services industry, and our offering of Internet banking and mobile banking platforms that seek to serve our customers when and how they want to be served. In addition, the consolidation of clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of financial institutions with such central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the exposure of cyberattacks on critical parties that may affect us. Evaluating and monitoring the cyberthreat landscape in comparison to our existing capabilities, and adjusting our programs in order to respond to these threats, may require additional capital expenses for human resources and technology.\nIn 2016, we experienced three DDoS attacks. The first occurred in February 2016 on one of our data centers. Customers may have experienced intermittent log-on issues with the U.S. Personal Internet Banking website, HSBCnet and the public websites. The attack was successfully mitigated via internal and external vendor controls in multiple datacenters. The second DDoS attack occurred in July 2016 when HSBC experienced a second DDoS attack targeting the U.S. Personal Internet Banking website. The attack traffic did not impact business services, and was systematically and effectively mitigated by our internal DDoS protection services without the need to invoke external vendor mitigation. In August 2016, we observed another DDoS attack on our U.S. Personal Internet Banking website, which impacted multiple Internet facing services. This attack was successfully mitigated via internal and external vendor controls in multiple datacenters. We have also been the subject of these types of attacks in prior years.\nOur businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security (including cyber security) from time to time.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence, fraud or misconduct. Non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct, negligence and fraud could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. We are dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated third parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of 'rogue traders' or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective. Employee misconduct could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may suffer losses due to negligence, fraud or misconduct by third parties. We depend on third party suppliers, outsource providers and our affiliates for a variety of services. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties' own systems or employees. The OCC and FRB require financial institutions to maintain third party and service provider risk management programs, which include due diligence requirements for third parties and service providers as well as for our affiliates who may perform services for us. Under FRB guidance \"service providers\" is broadly defined to include all entities that have entered into a contractual relationship with a financial institution to provide business functions or activities. If our third party risk and service provider management and due diligence program is not sufficiently robust, this could lead to regulatory intervention. Any of these occurrences could diminish\nHSBC USA Inc.\nour ability to operate one or more of our businesses, and may result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage or regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nFailure to successfully change our operational practices may have a material impact on our businesses. Changes to operational practices from time to time could materially impact our performance and results. Such changes may include:\n\u2022\nour determining to sell residential mortgage loans and other loans;\n\u2022\nchanges to our customer account management and risk management/collection policies and practices;\n\u2022\nour investment choices in technology, business infrastructure and specialized personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges to our AML and sanctions policies and the related operations practices; or\n\u2022\nour outsourcing of various operations, including our mortgage servicing business.\nFurther, in order to react quickly to or meet newly-implemented regulatory requirements, we may need to change or enhance systems within very tight time frames, which would increase operational risk. Failure to implement changes to our operational practices successfully and efficiently may diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses and could result in reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nFederal Reserve Board policies can significantly affect business and economic conditions and, as a result, our financial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and derivative instruments. Its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.\nWe may not be able to meet regulatory requests for data. The volume, granularity, frequency and scale of regulatory and other reporting requirements necessitate a clear data strategy to enable consistent data aggregation, reporting and management. Inadequate management information systems or processes, including those relating to risk data aggregation and risk reporting, could lead to a failure to meet regulatory reporting requirements or other internal or external information demands. Financial institutions that fail to comply with the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as set out by the Basel Committee may face supervisory measures. Any of these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe delivery of our regulatory priorities is subject to execution risk. The financial services industry is currently facing an unprecedented period of scrutiny. Additionally, we are subject to a number of consent orders with our regulators. Regulatory requests, legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement. The magnitude and complexity of projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Organizational change and external factors, including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk. These factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our regulatory priorities.\nOur data management and policies and processes may not be sufficiently robust. Critical business processes across the HSBC Group rely on large volumes of data from a number of different systems and sources. If data governance, data quality and data architecture policies and procedures are not sufficiently robust, manual intervention, adjustments and reconciliations may be required to reduce the risk of error in reporting to senior management or regulators. Inadequate policies and processes may also affect our ability to use data to service customers more effectively and/or improve our product offering. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nUncertainty surrounding the potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by the new Administration that may directly impact financial institutions and the global economy. The new Administration has indicated that it would like to see changes made to certain financial reform regulations, including Dodd-Frank, which has resulted in increased regulatory uncertainty, and we are assessing the potential impact on financial and economic markets and on our business. Changes in federal policy and regulatory agencies are expected to occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. The nature, timing and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain. At this time, it is unclear what laws, regulations and policies may change and whether future changes or uncertainty surrounding future changes will adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that continues to undergo significant change as a result of financial regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from the financial crisis and continued challenging economic conditions. We target internationally mobile clients who need sophisticated global solutions and generally compete on the basis of the quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers' needs, the extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our market share and results\nHSBC USA Inc.\nof operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive. Additionally, if our products and services are not accepted by our targeted clients, this may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the current economic, regulatory, and political environment for large financial institutions such as us, and possible public backlash to bank fees, there is increased competitive pressure to provide products and services at current or lower prices. Consequently, our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their products and services. Any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customers and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers. Continued technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic payment solutions. We may not respond effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our businesses to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers' needs. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant exposure to counterparty risk. We are exposed to counterparties that are involved in virtually all major industries, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in financial services, including brokers and dealers, central clearing counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. Our ability to engage in routine transactions to fund our operations and manage our risks could be materially adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial institutions are necessarily interdependent because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a consequence, a default by, or decline in market confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety about the financial services industry generally, can lead to further individual and/or systemic difficulties, defaults and losses.\nMandatory central clearing of over the counter derivatives, including under the Dodd-Frank Act, brings new risks to us. As a clearing member, we have financial exposure for losses incurred at a Central Counterparty (\"CCP\") by the default of other clearing members. Hence central clearing brings with it a new element of interconnectedness between clearing members and clients that we believe may increase rather than reduce our exposure to systemic risk. At the same time, our ability to manage such risk ourselves will be reduced because risk controls are largely managed by the CCPs themselves and it is unclear at present how, at a time of stress, regulators and resolution authorities would intervene.\nIn situations in which we strive to mitigate counterparty risk by taking collateral, our credit risk may remain high if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or must be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty. There is a risk that collateral cannot be realized, including situations where this arises by change of law that may influence our ability to foreclose on collateral or otherwise enforce contractual rights.\nWe also have credit exposure arising from risk defeasance products such as credit default swaps (\"CDSs\"), and other credit derivatives, each of which is carried at fair value. The risk of default by counterparties to CDSs and other credit derivatives used as mitigants affects the fair value of these instruments depending on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the underlying instrument against which protection has been purchased. Any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial condition of our clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect us. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that we could incur in our market-making and clearing businesses.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a consequence, a default by, or decline in market confidence in, individual institutions, or anxiety about the financial services industry generally, can lead to further individual and/or systemic difficulties, defaults and losses. HSBC routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. When such a counterparty or client becomes bankrupt or insolvent, we may become involved in significant disputes or litigation with the counterparty's or client's bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations, each of which could increase our operational and litigation costs.\nSignificant or prolonged periods of market stress or illiquidity could further decrease our ability to realize the fair value of collateral held by us or make it more likely that we would liquidate collateral at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure\nHSBC USA Inc.\nto the respective counterparty or client. Further, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity.\nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions, could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. The credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices and higher unemployment, or other factors. For example, changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in the portfolio and our allowance for credit losses.\nWhile we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2016, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if commodity prices and economic conditions in Latin America remain under pressure or if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of a deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.\nConcentrations of credit and market risk, including exposure to Latin American corporate clients and the oil and gas markets, could increase the potential for significant losses. We have exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. While we regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks, our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful. We have exposure to commercial customers domiciled outside of the United States and or in sectors that can be materially affected by changing economic conditions such as customers in the commodity sector. For example, a significant portion of our loan portfolio by region is concentrated with clients in Latin America and a significant portion of our loan portfolio by sector is concentrated in the oil and gas industry. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations.\nDue to our strategy to serve the banking needs of an international customer base, a number of the loans with our owned mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of loans to borrowers without traditional U.S. credit. Despite risk management mitigation, there is inherently higher uncertainty around loss rates due to the lack of detailed historic credit information on each borrower.\nOur inability to meet funding requirements due to deposit attrition or access to the capital markets. HSBC USA is a holding company without operations of its own and therefore relies on dividends and other distributions for a portion of its funding and liquidity. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Our primary source of funding is deposits, augmented by issuance of commercial paper and term debt. Adequate liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses.\nWe also access wholesale markets in order to provide funding for entities that do not accept deposits, to align asset and liability maturities and currencies and to maintain a market presence. We issued a total of $8,694 million of long-term debt at various points in 2016, including $4,000 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America. An inability to obtain financing in the unsecured long-term or short-term debt capital markets because of market factors or factors in our business could have a substantial adverse effect on our liquidity. Unfavorable macroeconomic developments, market disruptions or regulatory developments may increase our funding costs or challenge our ability to raise funds to support our businesses, materially adversely affecting our businesses, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nDespite the apparent improvements in overall market liquidity and our liquidity position, future conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include:\n\u2022\nan inability to maintain stable deposit balances because customers may invest in other financial instruments as an alternative;\n\u2022\ndiminished access to capital markets because of market factors or factors in our business;\n\u2022\nan increased interest rate environment for our commercial paper, deposits or term debt;\n\u2022\nunforeseen cash or capital requirements;\n\u2022\nan inability to sell assets; and\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain expected funding from HSBC Group subsidiaries and through deposits.\nThese conditions could be caused by a number of factors, including internal and external factors, such as, among others:\nHSBC USA Inc.\n\u2022\nfinancial and credit market disruption;\n\u2022\nvolatility or lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets;\n\u2022\nlack of market or customer confidence in HSBC or negative news about HSBC or the financial services industry generally; and\n\u2022\nother conditions and factors over which we have little or no control including economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and concerns over potential government defaults and related policy initiatives.\nHSBC has provided us with capital support in the past and has indicated its commitment and capacity to fund the needs of our businesses in the future. Notwithstanding, if we are unable to maintain stable deposit balances and/or raise funds in the capital markets, our liquidity position could be adversely affected and we might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, or to fund new loans, investments and businesses. We may need to liquidate unencumbered assets to meet our liabilities. In a time of reduced liquidity, we may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we may need to sell assets at depressed prices, which in either case could materially adversely affect our businesses, prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funding. Our credit ratings are an important part of maintaining our liquidity. We depend on access to the securities market for a portion of our funding. We issued a total of $8,694 million of long-term debt in 2016, including $4,000 million of senior debt issued to HSBC North America. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, which consider a number of factors including their assessment of our relative financial strength and results of operations, including our strategy and our management's capability, as well as factors affecting the financial services industry generally, including legal and regulatory frameworks affecting our business activities and the rights of our creditors. There can be no assurance that downgrades will not occur. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could potentially increase our borrowing costs, impact our ability to issue commercial paper and, depending on the severity of the downgrade, substantially limit our access to capital markets, require us to make cash payments or post collateral and permit termination by counterparties of certain significant contracts. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts.\nIn March 2016, Moody's changed the rating outlook for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change for HSBC signifies Moody's concerns about a weakening in its intrinsic financial strength due to deteriorating operating conditions in Hong Kong, one of HSBC's key markets. In spite of their concerns, Moody's stated that HSBC's willingness to provide support to its U.S. subsidiaries remains very high. While the outlook changed, Moody's affirmed its long- and short-term supported debt and deposit ratings for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA.\nIn July 2016, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (\"S&P\") took various rating agency actions on U.K. banks, including HSBC, to reflect rising economic risks for the U.K. domestic banking industry, including potential pressures arising from the U.K. vote to leave the EU. As a result, S&P changed the rating outlook for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable. While the outlook changed, S&P affirmed its long- and short-term counterparty credit ratings for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA.\nRating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and litigation matters, all of which may lead to adverse ratings actions. Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At December 31, 2016, there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies.\nFinancial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may negatively affect our servicing and investment portfolios. Our servicing portfolio includes certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from one or more mortgage insurance companies. To the extent that any of these companies experience financial difficulties or credit downgrades, we may be required, as servicer of the insured loan on behalf of the investor, to obtain replacement coverage with another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we would replace. We may be responsible for some or all of the incremental cost of the new coverage for certain loans depending on the terms of our servicing agreement with the investor and other circumstances, although we do not have an additional risk of repurchase loss associated with claim amounts for loans sold to third-party investors. Similarly, some of the mortgage loans we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a mortgage insurer is unable to meet its credit obligations with respect to an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if replacement coverage is not obtained. We also have investments in municipal bonds that are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. The value of these bonds and the payment of principal and interest on them may be negatively affected by financial difficulties or credit downgrades experienced by the bond insurers.\nThe manner in which we hold, service and enforce residential mortgage loans in our portfolio may be challenged. We are subject to certain legal and contractual requirements for how we hold, transfer, use or enforce promissory notes, security instruments and other documents for residential mortgage loans that we service. In recent years, challenges have been raised to whether we\nHSBC USA Inc.\nhave adhered to these requirements, and whether, as a result in some instances, the loans can be enforced as local law otherwise would permit. Additionally, we currently use the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) system for approximately half of the residential mortgage loans that remain in our servicing portfolio. Individual borrowers and certain local governments have contended that the use of MERS is improper or otherwise adversely affects the security interest. If documentation requirements were not met, or if the use of MERS or the MERS system is found not valid or effective, we could be obligated to, or choose to, take remedial actions and may be subject to additional costs or losses.\nLawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment. In the ordinary course of business, HSBC USA and its affiliates are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current and/or former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and formal and informal proceedings, as described in Note 27, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, remediation payments, injunctions and other relief. There is no certainty that the litigation will decrease in the near future, especially in the event of a resurgent recession or additional regulatory and law enforcement investigations and proceedings by federal and state governmental agencies.\nFinancial service providers are at risk of regulatory sanctions or fines related to conduct of business and financial crime. The incidence of regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial service firms is increasing, with a corresponding increase also in civil litigation arising from or relating to issues which are subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions or fines. In the current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the financial services industry, there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other regulators, including the CFPB, CFTC, state Attorneys General or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that, if determined adversely, may result in judgments, settlements, substantial fines, penalties, remediation payments or other results, including additional compliance requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. In addition, HSBC's extensive global operations also increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs. For example, operations in emerging markets, including facilitating cross-border transactions on behalf of its clients, subjects it to higher compliance risks under U.S. regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, included the FCPA and AML. These risks can be more acute in less developed markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of our affiliates' business activities. Criminal prosecutions of financial institutions for, among other alleged conduct, breaches of AML, sanctions and FCPA regulations, antitrust violations, market manipulation, aiding and abetting tax evasion, and providing unlicensed cross-border banking services, have become more commonplace and may increase in frequency due to increased media attention and higher expectations from prosecutors and the public. Any such prosecution or investigation of, or legal proceeding or regulatory action brought against, HSBC or one or more of its subsidiaries could result in substantial fines, penalties and/or forfeitures and could have a material adverse effect on our results, business and prospects, including the potential loss of key licenses, requirement to exit certain businesses and withdrawal of funding from depositors and other stakeholders. See \"Failure to implement our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results and operations\" and \"We may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes\" below.\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of many of the legal, regulatory and other adversarial proceedings involving our businesses, particularly those cases in which matters are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, those which seek unspecified damages or those which involve novel legal claims. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes. As previously reported, HSBC Bank USA entered into the OCC Servicing Consent Order with the OCC and our affiliate, HSBC Finance, and our then indirect parent, HSBC North America entered into a similar consent order with the FRB following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry foreclosure practices.\nThe Servicing Consent Orders required an independent review of foreclosures pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. We refer to this as the Independent Foreclosure Review or IFR. In 2013, HSBC Bank USA entered into an agreement with the OCC, and HSBC Finance and HSBC North America entered into an agreement with the FRB, which we refer to as the \"IFR Settlement Agreements,\" to amend the Servicing Consent Orders, pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review ceased and HSBC North America made a cash payment of $96 million into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010 and, in addition, is providing other assistance (e.g., loan modifications) to help eligible borrowers. As a result, in 2012, we recorded expenses of $19 million reflecting the portion of HSBC North America's total expense we believe is allocable to us. See Note 27, \"Litigation and Regulatory Matters,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nHSBC USA Inc.\nIn June 2015, HSBC Bank USA consented to amendments to the OCC Servicing Consent Order which set forth the OCC's conclusions that compliance with all requirements of the OCC Servicing Consent Order had not yet been achieved and imposed certain additional business restrictions on HSBC Bank USA. On January 6, 2017, the OCC terminated the OCC Servicing Consent Order, together with the 2013 and 2015 amendments thereto, after determining that HSBC Bank USA had satisfied the requirements thereunder. The OCC also assessed a $32.5 million civil money penalty against HSBC Bank USA finding that HSBC Bank USA failed to correct deficiencies identified under the OCC Servicing Consent Order in a timely fashion. The OCC also found that HSBC Bank USA failed to file payment change notices in compliance with applicable bankruptcy rules on about 1,700 mortgage loan accounts, which resulted in approximately $3.5 million in remediation to borrowers. An additional charge to income in the amount of $27.5 million was taken by HSBC Bank USA in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to this matter.\nCompliance related costs have permanently increased to higher levels due to the remediation requirements of the Servicing Consent Orders. In addition, the issuance of the Servicing Consent Orders, as well as the termination of the OCC Servicing Consent Order does not preclude additional enforcement actions against HSBC Bank USA or our affiliates by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies, such as the DOJ or state Attorneys General, which could include the imposition of civil money penalties and other sanctions relating to the activities addressed by the Servicing Consent Orders.\nFurther, the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review does not preclude future private litigation concerning these practices. Separate from the Servicing Consent Orders and the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review discussed above, in February 2012, the DOJ, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and state Attorneys General of 49 states announced a settlement with the five largest U.S. mortgage servicers with respect to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices. In February 2016, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance, HSBC Mortgage Services Inc. and HSBC North America entered into an agreement with the DOJ, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, other federal agencies (\"Federal Parties\") and the Attorneys General of 49 states and the District of Columbia (\"State Parties\") to resolve civil claims related to past residential mortgage loan origination and servicing practices. The national mortgage settlement, may not, however, completely preclude other enforcement actions by state or federal agencies, regulators or law enforcement agencies related to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices, including, but not limited to, matters relating to the securitization of mortgages for investors, including the imposition of civil money penalties, criminal fines or other sanctions. In addition, these practices have in the past resulted in private litigation and such a settlement would not preclude further private litigation concerning foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses relating to mortgage loan repurchases and other mortgage loan securitization-related activities. In connection with our loan sale and securitization activities with Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\"), the government sponsored enterprises (\"GSEs\"), and loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, HUSI has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. For transactions with the GSEs, these representations include type of collateral, underwriting standards, validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan, that primary mortgage insurance is in force for any mortgage loan with a loan-to-value ratio (\"LTV\") greater than 80 percent, and the use of the GSEs' standard legal documentation. We may be, and have been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other private investors for losses due to breaches of representations and warranties.\nIn estimating our repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider several factors, including the level of outstanding repurchase demands in inventory and our historical defense rate, the level of outstanding requests for loan files and the related historical repurchase request conversion rate and defense rate, the level of potential future demands based on historical conversion rates of loans for which we have not received a loan file request but are two or more payments delinquent or expected to become delinquent at an estimated conversion rate, and any settlements reached with our counterparties. While we believe that our current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are dependent on economic factors, investor demand strategies, housing market trends and other circumstances, which are beyond our control and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future.\nWe have also been involved as a sponsor/seller of loans used to facilitate whole loan securitizations underwritten by our affiliate, HSI, and serve as trustee of various securitization trusts. Participants in the U.S. mortgage securitization market that purchased and repackaged whole loans have been the subject of lawsuits and governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries, which have been directed at groups within the U.S. mortgage market, such as servicers, originators, underwriters, trustees or sponsors of securitizations, and at particular participants within these groups. As the industry's residential foreclosure issues continue, HSBC Bank USA has taken title to an increasing number of foreclosed homes as trustee on behalf of various securitization trusts. As nominal record owner of these properties, HSBC Bank USA has been sued by municipalities and tenants alleging various obligations of law, including laws regarding property upkeep and tenants' rights. While we believe and continue to maintain that the obligations\nHSBC USA Inc.\nat issue and any related liability are properly those of the servicer of each trust, we continue to receive significant and adverse publicity in connection with these and similar matters, including foreclosures that are serviced by others in the name of \"HSBC, as trustee.\" As a result, we may be subject to additional litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our participation in the U.S. mortgage securitization market, either individually or as a member of a group.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or other reference rates may adversely impact the value of debt securities and other financial instruments we hold or issue that are linked to such reference rates and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. As a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily LIBOR, a number of British Bankers' Association member banks entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of LIBOR, and there are ongoing investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions. Methods of calculating LIBOR have been affected by new regulation, and similar changes may occur to other reference rates. Various regulators and competition and enforcement authorities are conducting investigations and reviews related to certain past submissions made by panel banks and the processes for making submissions in connection with the setting of the European interbank offered rates and other benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would impact the value of any debt securities we hold or issue that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit we hold or are due to us, or for which we are an obligor, that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or whether, or to what extent, such changes would impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions could negatively impact our business structures, activities and practices. The Dodd-Frank Act requires HSBC as a foreign bank holding company and our ultimate parent to prepare and submit annually a plan for the orderly resolution of the U.S. businesses under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of future material financial distress or failure (the Systemically Important Financial Institution Plan or \"SIFI Plan\"). The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on reducing risks to the U.S. financial system, requiring a plan to demonstrate how the relevant entities can be resolved in a \"rapid and orderly\" fashion in a manner that avoids systemic risks. Similarly, HSBC Bank USA must prepare and submit an annual resolution plan under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the Insured Depository Institution Plan or \"IDI Plan\"). HSBC Bank USA is required to regularly provide a plan to the FDIC that is executable for resolving the bank in the event of its failure that protects depositors, maximizes the net present value return on assets and minimizes the amount of any losses to creditors, including the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund. These plans must include information on resolution strategy, agreements with major counterparties and \"interdependencies,\" among other things. Resolution planning requires substantial effort, time and cost across all of our businesses and geographies. The HSBC SIFI Plan is subject to review by both the FRB and the FDIC and the HSBC Bank USA IDI Plan is subject to review by the FDIC. In December 2015, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA submitted their 2015 plans and, as of the date of this report, have not received formal feedback on the 2015 plans from the agencies. During the third quarter of 2016, the next annual submission date for both the HSBC SIFI Plan and the HSBC Bank USA IDI Plan were extended to December 31, 2017.\nIf the FRB and the FDIC both determine that a SIFI Plan is not \"credible\" (which, although not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plans are feasible or would otherwise allow resolution of a financial institution's U.S. businesses in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss), and the deficiencies are not remedied within the required time period, an institution, including HSBC, could be required to restructure or reorganize businesses, legal entities, or operational systems and intra-company transactions in ways that could negatively impact operations, or be subject to restrictions on growth. We could also eventually be subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or be required to divest certain assets or operations.\nThe transition to the new requirements under Basel III will continue to put additional pressure on regulatory capital and liquidity. HSBC North America is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance, in accordance with current regulatory timelines. In 2010, the Basel Committee issued \"Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\" (the \"Basel III Capital Framework\") and \"International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring\" (the \"Basel III Liquidity Framework\") (together, \"Basel III\"). In 2013, the U.S. banking regulators published a final rule implementing the Basel III Capital Framework and the Dodd-Frank Act's phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, which we refer to as the \"Basel III final rule.\" The Basel III final rule establishes new minimum capital and buffer requirements to be phased in by 2019 and also requires the deduction of certain assets from capital, within prescribed limitations, and the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\") in capital. The Basel III final rule also increases capital requirements for counterparty credit risk and introduces a SLR with full implementation and compliance required by January 1, 2018. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA began complying with the effective portions of the Basel III final rule on January 1, 2014. The Basel III final rule will increase our regulatory capital requirements over the next two years as capital deductions, adjustments and buffers are phased in until full implementation on January 1, 2019.\nIn addition to the Basel III final rule, there continue to be numerous proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as HSBC North America, as well as our ability to meet these\nHSBC USA Inc.\nrequirements. The Basel Committee intends to finalize reform initiatives in three areas in 2017: (i) enhancements to the risk sensitivity and robustness of the standardized approaches; (ii) review of the role of internal models in the capital framework; and (iii) finalization of the design and calibration of the leverage ratio and capital floors. These reform initiatives include adoption of revisions to the market risk capital framework and proposed consultations on revisions to the standardized approaches for operational risk and credit risk. Further revisions to the Basel III Capital Framework resulting from these initiatives could materially increase our capital requirements to the extent they are implemented by the FRB.\nFurther increases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other U.S. supervisory requirements relating to capital. The exact amount, however, will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and that of our North America affiliates under various stress scenarios. Participation by HSBC North America in the FRB's CCAR stress test process also requires that HSBC North America maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios over a nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon, which could also require increased capital to withstand the application of the stress scenarios over the planning horizon. The FRB has also indicated that it is considering a new measure to replace the capital conservation buffer with a \"stress capital buffer,\" which would equal a bank holding company's projected decline in common equity Tier 1 under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, prior to any planned capital actions, and would be reset each year based on the bank holding company's DFAST results. We are reviewing these possible changes to the capital conservation buffer in anticipation of the formal rulemaking and their potential impact on our capital planning processes specifically and our operations and results generally. We currently target internal capital levels using an approach analogous to the stress capital buffer and, therefore, we do not expect the proposal to have a significant impact on our U.S. operations or change our capital planning processes.\nHSBC Bank USA is also required to participate in the OCC's DFAST. These stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.\nThe Basel Committee has adopted two minimum liquidity risk measures which are applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The LCR measures the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered, HQLA relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under a significant 30-day stress scenario. The NSFR measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The FRB, the OCC and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the LCR with stricter requirements and a faster implementation timeline than the Basel Committee has established. Under the final rules, certain large banking institutions such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and were required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to change their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR final rule, is more stringent in several areas. Under the proposal, U.S. institutions would be required to comply with the NSFR rule by January 1, 2018, consistent with the scheduled global implementation of the Basel Committee based NSFR. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules.\nPreparation for Basel III has influenced and is likely to continue to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and is expected to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. We are unable at this time to determine the extent of changes HSBC USA will need to make to its liquidity or capital position, if any, and what effect, if any, such changes will have on our results of operations or financial condition. New regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital and may require us to increase our capital or liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure. We use models for a range of purposes in managing our business, including regulatory capital calculations, stress testing, credit approvals, financial crime and fraud risk management and financial reporting. We could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions, which may lead to actions by management, based on models that are poorly developed, implemented or used, or as a result of the modeled outcome being misunderstood or the use of such information for purposes for which it was not designed. We hold capital for known risks and limitations of our models as appropriate. If additional weakness in a model is discovered or if a model is shown to have failed, we may be required to hold more capital. Risks arising from use of models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, minimum capital requirements and reputation.\nRegulatory scrutiny and supervisory concerns over the use by banks of models is considerable, particularly the internal models and assumptions used by banks in the application of the stress testing exercise and in the calculation of regulatory capital.\nManagement projections, estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting\nHSBC USA Inc.\nestimates to determine loan loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangibles, among other items. In particular, loan loss reserve estimates and certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management's judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control. To the extent historical averages of the progression of loans into stages of delinquency or the amount of loss realized upon charge-off are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in historical models, unexpected additional losses could result. Similarly, to the extent assumptions employed in measuring fair value of assets and liabilities not supported by market prices or other observable parameters do not sufficiently capture their inherent risk, unexpected additional losses could result.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Note 16, \"Income Taxes,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our deferred tax assets.\nWe may be adversely affected by potential changes in U.S. tax laws which could result in a significant reduction to our deferred tax assets. The U.S. Congress and the new Administration have indicated an interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code. Though the specifics and timing of any possible tax reforms are unknown, possible approaches include lowering the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned outside the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences. We currently have $1.8 billion of net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, which consists primarily of basis differences associated with certain real estate mortgage investment conduits and the allowance for credit losses. Although any reduction in the corporate income tax rate could reduce the amount of taxes we would pay in the future, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could also result in a decrease in the value of our deferred tax assets and a reduction to our net income and total equity during the period in which any tax rate change is enacted.\nOur interpretation or application of the tax laws to which it is subject could differ from those of the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in the payment of additional taxes and penalties. We are subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are inherently complex and we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to its entities, operations and businesses. Our interpretations and application of the tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, which could be material.\nOur financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \"material weaknesses\" in our internal control over financial reporting. In a company as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies, including significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and we cannot assure you that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given year.\nChanges in accounting standards are beyond our control and may have a material impact on how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the IASB, the SEC and our bank regulators, including the OCC and the FRB, change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation thereof, and guidance that govern the preparation and disclosure of external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report and disclose our financial results and condition, including our segment results. For example, the FASB's financial instruments project will likely, among other things, significantly change how we measure credit impairment on our loan portfolios, which could also affect the level of deferred tax assets that we recognize. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. We may, in certain instances, change a business practice in order to comply with new or revised standards.\nKey employees may be difficult to attract or retain due to contraction of the business and limits on promotional activities. Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. Employee fatigue, relocations, hiring freezes and external competition targeting top talent could have impacts on attrition. If we were unable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified key employees to support the various functions of our businesses, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Our financial performance, expense reduction initiatives, and reductions in variable compensation and other benefits could raise concerns about key employees' future compensation and opportunities for promotion. Any future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation\nHSBC USA Inc.\nor regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees. As economic conditions continue to improve, we may face increased difficulty in retaining top performers and critical skilled employees. Severe and unrelenting demands continue to be placed on our employees. The cumulative workload arising from a regulatory reform program that is often extra-territorial and still evolving is hugely consumptive of human resources, placing increasingly complex and conflicting demands on a workforce where the required expert capabilities are in short supply and globally mobile. If key personnel were to leave us and equally knowledgeable or skilled personnel are unavailable within the HSBC Group or could not be sourced in the market, our ability to manage our business, in particular through any future difficult economic environment may be hindered or impaired.\nSignificant reductions in pension assets may require additional financial contributions from us. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan. At January 1, 2013, all future contributions under the Cash Balance formula ceased, thereby eliminating future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2016, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $480 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 20, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.", "PERMNO": 53938, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HBC2"}
