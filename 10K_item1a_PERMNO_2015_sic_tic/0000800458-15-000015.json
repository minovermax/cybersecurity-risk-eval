{"cik": "800458", "company": "RENTRAK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nCertain Essentials\u00ae services face various obstacles to widespread market adoption, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than ours.\nOur Essentials\u00ae services are dependent on several factors for long-term success, including our ability to compete with larger and more seasoned competitors in this market. Our primary competitors currently are Nielsen and TiVo. Each of these competitors has significantly greater resources than we do, which could allow them to become more formidable competitors with enhanced technology service solutions. Additionally, we face other obstacles. For instance, we may be unable to reasonably obtain data and/or data providers may be reluctant or ultimately decide not to grant us adequate access to their digital transaction data, which is a key component of our systems. The owners of data may also impose greater restrictions on the use and reporting of such data, which may make it difficult to fully realize the opportunities we anticipate for our products and related services. Further, the marketplace (such as advertisers, advertising agencies and television networks) may be reluctant to adopt a new standard of viewership measurement. These factors could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow these services, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may lose a significant number of clients if we are unable to obtain requisite data and other content to source our systems which provide our Essentials\u00ae services.\nOur Essentials\u00ae services rely on data collected from a wide variety of sources. Once received, the data must be reviewed, processed, integrated and, at times, converted to our required file format. If we are unable to obtain quality data feeds and process that data in a timely manner, we may not be able to meet the needs of our clients, and we could lose clients. The loss of a significant number of Essentials\u00ae clients would have an adverse impact on our ability to grow our Essentials\u00ae product lines and related revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have operations outside of the United States that subject us to legal, business, political, cultural and other risks of international operations.\nWe operate globally, which subjects us to a number of risks and burdens, including:\n\u2022\nstaffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\n\u2022\nprice and currency exchange rates and controls;\n\u2022\ntaxes and tariffs;\n\u2022\ndifferent business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable, including longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability;\n\u2022\ndesigning and maintaining effective operating and financial controls;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of failure of internal controls, including any failure to detect unauthorized transactions; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs relating to personnel management as a result of government and other regulations.\nIn addition, economic conditions in our overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad and benefits we receive from those operations.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies, products or technologies, which may be costly, dilutive to stockholders and, in the event we experience difficulties in assimilating and integrating the personnel, technologies, operating systems and products and services of acquired businesses, less beneficial than we anticipate.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire or invest in other companies, products or technologies that complement our current product offerings, enhance our technical capabilities, expand our operations into new markets or offer other growth opportunities. Such acquisitions may be costly and potentially dilutive to existing shareholders in the event we offer capital stock as consideration in an acquisition. For example, we issued shares of our capital stock in the acquisition of the U.S. television measurement business related to television tuning analytics utilizing return path data of WPP\u2019s Kantar business unit. Acquisitions could also pose risks to our operations and operating results, including the possibilities of:\n\u2022\nincreased costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses or technologies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties assimilating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies or products into our company;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel at an acquired business who decide not to work for us;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing operations;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on relationships with our existing suppliers, customers or partners;\n\u2022\na need for additional capital or debt financing to complete acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nthe impairment of intangible assets acquired.\nThe described risks would be magnified as the size of an acquisition increases or if the acquisitions are in geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. As a result of these and other challenges, we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions even if we can find suitable acquisition opportunities at what we believe to be attractive valuations, which we do not assure.\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our business.\nWe primarily operate within the media, advertising and entertainment industry. Our overall success depends on the success of national networks and local stations, studios, cable operators, data providers, advertisers, and advertising agencies. The success of these businesses is dependent on consumer economic activity. For example, our Box Office Essentials\u00ae clients depend on consumers being interested in, and financially able to attend, movies in theaters. Changes in the economic climate and consumer spending could impact the financial condition of our clients. Such changes that affect our clients could, in turn, decrease the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, if our clients experience financial difficulties, they may be unable to continue to purchase our services or pay for services in a timely manner, if at all. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition in the markets in which we operate and those in which we are currently developing new service offerings.\nSome of our competitors have extensive distribution networks, long-standing relationships with our suppliers and customers, stronger brand name recognition and significantly greater financial resources than we do. These factors may enable our competition to have increased bargaining and purchasing power relating to resources that could enable them to operate in a more cost effective manner and/or to surpass our technological advancements. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our lines of business, including growing new lines of business and expanding existing lines of business related to our expanded relationship with GroupM and WPP.\nOur SRSE business is dependent on studios maintaining direct revenue sharing relationships with \u201cbrick-and-mortar,\u201d kiosks and online retailers.\nWe currently collect, process, audit, summarize and report transactional data relating to rental and sales activity of home entertainment content at traditional and online retailers and kiosk locations that have revenue sharing agreements directly with major studios. There are a number of risks that may adversely affect the size and profitability of this SRSE business. First and foremost, our business is dependent on the SRSE clients maintaining SRSE relationships with the SRSE Retailers. Should these clients end those relationships, they would have no need for our services. Second, our SRSE clients could decide to invest the resources necessary to provide these services internally. Lastly, if the overall size of the home entertainment rental market contracts significantly, or the large \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d and online retailers\u2019 share of the overall rental market declines substantially, the amount of data we process and audit on behalf of our clients would also be reduced, resulting in a decrease in our revenue. These and other factors could potentially reduce the demand for our SRSE services and the quantity of data we process, which would negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe future success of our company is highly dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our base of clients who subscribe to our Essentials\u00ae product offerings.\nOur success depends on effective software solutions, marketing, sales and customer relations for our Essentials\u00ae services, as well as acceptance of future enhancements and new services by our existing and prospective clients. If we are unable to both retain existing clients and secure new clients for our Essentials\u00ae services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nWe have voluntarily applied for accreditation from the Media Rating Council (the \u201cMRC\u201d) for certain TV Essentials\u00ae products and services within our Essentials\u00ae product lines and we cannot predict when we will receive such accreditation, if at all.\nWe have voluntarily applied for accreditation from the MRC for our TV Essentials\u00ae products and services. The MRC is a third party nonprofit industry association whose members consist of companies within our industry, including television broadcasters, cable casters, advertisers, Internet organizations, advertising agencies and industry trade associations. The MRC\u2019s goal is to ensure measurement services are valid, reliable and effective. While we believe we will be successful in achieving this accreditation, and we have made significant investments and progress towards this initiative, there is no assurance we will receive this accreditation in the near future, if at all, and we cannot predict the impact this accreditation would have on our business.\nOur Essentials\u00ae services are highly dependent on employees who are skilled and experienced in information technologies.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain high quality information technology personnel at a reasonable cost, we may not be able to meet the needs of existing clients, enhance existing services, or develop new lines of business. This inability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMeasurement services are receiving a high level of consumer group and government scrutiny relating to the privacy issues around the methodologies used in targeted advertising.\nAlthough we are confident that our anonymous data aggregation methodologies are compliant with all current privacy laws, it is possible that privacy trends and market perceptions of the transparency of data could result in additional government restrictions or limitations on the use of that data, which would adversely affect many of our products. If additional government restrictions are imposed, such restrictions could slow our ability to realize a return on our investments in new data-driven products or result in additional costs not currently anticipated.\nOur services are highly dependent on the effective and efficient use of technology and our overall information management infrastructure.\nIf we are unable to acquire, establish and maintain our information management systems to ensure accurate, reliable and timely data processed in an efficient and cost effective manner, we may not be able to meet the needs of existing clients, enhance existing services or develop new lines of business. This inability could have an adverse effect on our business and long-term growth prospects.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Our data centers are located in areas with potential risk of earthquakes. Our data centers are also exposed to risks of break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenue and results of operations.\nThe loss of our executive officers and key employees could have an adverse impact on our business and development initiatives.\nWe believe that the development of our business has been, and will continue to be, dependent on certain key executives and employees of Rentrak. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect upon our business and development, and there is no assurance that adequate replacements could be found in the event of their unavailability.\nOur stock is subject to price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may prevent our shareholders from reselling our common stock at a profit.\nThe trading price of our common stock has, at times, experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, our common stock price has fluctuated from a high of $85.69 to a low of $45.57 for the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2015. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nannouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nsales of stock by us or by our shareholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers and other employees); and\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions on shares of our common stock.\nOregon law may have anti-takeover effects.\nThe Oregon Control Share Act and the Business Combination Act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us. These provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the Board of Directors. The provisions of the Oregon Control Share Act and the Business Combination Act could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely impact the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock.", "PERMNO": 10853, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RENT"}
