{"cik": "1261734", "company": "AEOLUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following information about risks described below, together with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, before you decide to buy or maintain an investment in our common stock. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this annual report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have operated at a loss and will likely continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant historical losses and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $186,630,000 as of September 30, 2015. During the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we incurred losses of $2,628,000 and $80,000, respectively. Our operating losses have been due primarily to our expenditures for research and development on our drug candidates and for general and administrative expenses and our lack of significant, or sufficient, revenues to offset all of the expenditures. We are likely to continue to incur operating losses until such time, if ever, that we generate significant recurring revenues from product sales, whether to the U.S. government for the Strategic National Stockpile or to the general healthcare community for commercial indications, like oncology, epilepsy or Parkinson's disease. We anticipate it will take a minimum of two years (and possibly longer) for us to generate recurring revenues. We expect that it will take at least that long before the development of any of our licensed, or other current potential, products is completed, marketing approvals are obtained from the FDA and commercial sales of any of these products can begin, or that we might receive a procurement from the U.S. Government following a pre-Emergency Use Authorization application or Animal Rule Approval.\nWe may need substantial additional funding to continue our operations and may be unable to raise capital when needed, or at all, which would force us to delay, curtail or eliminate our clinical programs and our product development programs.\nWe may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund human clinical trials and continue our research and development, unless and until we receive a procurement of sufficient size from the U.S. Government for the Strategic National Stockpile. In addition, we may need to raise substantial additional capital to enforce our proprietary rights, defend, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third party patents or other intellectual property rights; and commercialize, for non-government related indications, any of our products that may be approved by the FDA or any international regulatory authority.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had cash of approximately $94,000, which was supplemented by gross proceeds of approximately $7.75 million from the issuance of the BVF Notes in September of 2015 and the completion of the 2015 Securities Placement in December of 2015. During fiscal year 2015, our monthly cash requirements to operate our business that are not reimbursed under the BARDA Contract were approximately $204,000. However, this historical cash burn does not include amounts described herein whereby we expect that a portion of the net proceeds from the 2015 Securities Placement will be used to fund part of the future costs of ongoing commercial development programs to the extent they are not funded by the BARDA Contract. To the extent we do not have sufficient cash to fund our working capital requirements, we may not be able to pay our payables timely, which may cause vendors to cease providing services to us, and we may not be able to advance certain, if not all, development programs.\nIn order to fund on-going operating cash requirements, or to accelerate or expand our oncology and other programs we will need to raise significant additional funds. We are continuously considering additional strategic and financial options available to us, including public or private equity offerings, debt financings or collaboration arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. Debt financings, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and require significant interest payments. If we do not receive additional financing to fund our operations not reimbursed under the BARDA Contract, or if BARDA does not exercise any additional options under the BARDA Contract, and we are unable to raise sufficient capital for operations, we would have to discontinue some or all of our activities, merge with or sell, lease or license some or all of our assets to another company, or cease operations entirely, and our stockholders might lose all or part of their investments.\nIn addition, if our catalytic antioxidant program shows scientific progress, we will need significant additional funds to move our compounds through continued development and clinical trials. If we are unable to raise the amount of capital necessary, or do not receive a sufficient procurement from the U.S. Government for the Strategic National Stockpile, to complete development and reach commercialization of any of our catalytic antioxidant products, we will need to delay or cease development of one or more of these products or partner with another company for the development and commercialization of these products.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to continue to incur substantial losses and may never become profitable.\nWe have no products approved for commercialization in the United States or abroad. Our drug candidates are still being developed, and all but 10150 are still in early stages of development. Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances or approvals by the FDA and additional investment before they can be commercialized in the United States.\nOur likelihood of achieving profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:\n\u00b7\ndeveloping our existing drug candidates and developing and testing new drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nprotecting our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nestablishing our competitive position;\n\u00b7\nachieving third-party collaborations;\n\u00b7\nreceiving regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing and marketing products; and\n\u00b7\nreceiving government funding and identifying new government funding opportunities.\nMany of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control. We may not achieve sufficient revenues for profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, then our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $186,630,000 from our research, development and other activities. We have not generated material revenues from product sales and do not expect to generate product revenues sufficient to support us for at least several more years. As a result, we may not be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our requirements for additional capital may be substantial and will be dependent on many factors, including the success of our research and development efforts, our ability to commercialize and market products, our ability to successfully pursue our licensing and collaboration strategy, the receipt of government funding, competing technological developments, costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property and any future change in our business strategy.\nOur research and development (\"R&D\") activities are at an early stage and therefore might never result in viable products.\nOur catalytic antioxidant program is in the early stages of development, involves unproven technology, requires significant further R&D and regulatory approvals and is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products or therapeutic procedures based on innovative technologies. These risks include the possibilities that:\n\u00b7\nany or all of these proposed products or procedures are found to be unsafe or ineffective or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe proposed products or procedures are not economical to market or do not achieve broad market acceptance;\n\u00b7\nthird parties hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing the proposed products or procedures; and\n\u00b7\nthird parties market a superior or equivalent product.\nFurther, the timeframe for commercialization of any product is long and uncertain because of the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing approval can be obtained. We may not be able to successfully develop or market any of our proposed products or procedures. If we are not able to successfully market any product, our business will suffer.\nOur commercialization efforts may be adversely impacted by an FDA clinical hold on our Phase I clinical trial in Lung-ARS.\nIn September of 2014, the Company received notice from the FDA that our IND for 10150 for Lung ARS has been placed on a clinical hold following their review of our data. A clinical hold is an order that the FDA issues to a trial sponsor to suspend all ongoing clinical trials and delay all proposed trials. With this clinical hold, any patients in an ongoing clinical trial cannot receive treatment with 10150. Therefore, initiation of this Phase I clinical trial will be delayed indefinitely and may not occur at all. In particular, until the FDA lifts the clinical hold, or partially lifts the full clinical hold, we will be unable to submit any new clinical trial protocols to the FDA under our IND for 10150 for Lung ARS. If the FDA does not lift the full clinical hold, we may be unable to pursue the development of 10150 for Lung ARS. For additional information on our response to the FDA concerning this clinical hold, see \"Business --10150 as a potential medical countermeasure against the effects of Pulmonary Acute Radiation Syndrome (Lung ARS); Future Development Plans.\"\nIf our products are not successfully developed and eventually approved by the FDA, we may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAll of our drug candidates are at various stages of development and must be approved by the FDA or similar foreign governmental agencies before they can be marketed. The process for obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approval is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. This process typically requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing, which may take longer or cost more than we anticipate, and may prove unsuccessful due to numerous factors. Drug candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not successfully reach the market for a number of reasons. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of these drug candidates may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials.\nNumerous factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our drug development efforts, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in securing research laboratories to conduct research activities;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in securing centers to conduct trials;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in enrolling patients in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u00b7\nunexpected adverse reactions by patients in trials;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in obtaining clinical supplies of the product;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the FDA's or other regulatory body's requirements for our testing during the course of that testing;\n\u00b7\ninability to generate statistically significant data confirming the efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u00b7\nmodification of the drug during testing; and\n\u00b7\nreallocation of our limited financial and other resources to other clinical programs.\nIt is possible that none of the products we develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin commercializing them. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but often can take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the nature of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform on data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular drug candidate and we may not have the financial resources to continue to develop our drug candidates and, as a result, may have to terminate our operations.\nIf we do not reach the market with our products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses, or if we are not effective in marketing our products, our revenues from product sales, if any, will be reduced.\nWe face intense competition in our development activities. Many of our competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies or more established bioterrorism product companies, which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us, which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete.\nWe are and expect to remain dependent upon collaborations with third parties for the development of new products, and adverse events involving these collaborations could prevent us from developing and commercializing our drug candidates and achieving profitability.\nWe currently license from third parties, and do not own, rights under patents and certain related intellectual property for the development of our drug candidates. In addition, we expect to enter into agreements with third parties to license rights to our drug candidates. We might not be able to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms favorable to us, if at all. Further, if any of our current licenses were to expire or terminate, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur research and development activities rely on technology licensed from third parties, and termination of any of those licenses would result in loss of significant rights to develop and market our products, which would impair our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have exclusive worldwide rights to our antioxidant small molecule technology through license agreements with Duke, NJH and the University of Colorado. Each license generally may be terminated by the licensor if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, including obligations to develop the compounds and technologies under license. If terminated, we would lose the right to develop the products, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The license agreements also generally require us to meet specified milestones or show reasonable diligence in development of the technology. If disputes arise over the definition of these requirements or whether we have satisfied the requirements in a timely manner, or if any other obligations in the license agreements are disputed by the other party, the other party could terminate the agreement, and we could lose our rights to develop the licensed technology.\nIf new technology is developed from these licenses, we may be required to negotiate certain key financial and other terms, such as royalty payments, for the licensing of this future technology with these research institutions, and it might not be possible to obtain any such license on terms that are satisfactory to us, or at all.\nWe now rely, and will continue to rely, heavily on third parties for product and clinical development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products.\nWe currently depend heavily and will depend heavily in the future on third parties for support in product development, clinical development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products. The termination of some or all of our existing collaborative arrangements, or our inability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue or complete clinical development of our products.\nWe rely on contract clinical research organizations (\"CROs\") for various aspects of our clinical development activities including clinical trial monitoring, data collection and data management. As a result, we have had and continue to have less control over the conduct of clinical trials, the timing and completion of the trials, the required reporting of adverse events and the management of data developed through the trial than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Although we rely on CROs to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements.\nThe third parties on which we rely may have staffing difficulties, may undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed, adversely affecting their willingness or ability to conduct our trials. We may experience unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Any failure of such CROs to successfully accomplish clinical trial monitoring, data collection and data management and the other services they provide for us in a timely manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical development of our products and obtain regulatory approval. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternate service provider. However, making such changes may be costly and would likely delay our trials, and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.\nIf BARDA opts not to exercise its options under the BARDA Contract, we would be dependent upon grants from NIH for continued development of 10150 for Lung-ARS, or we would need to curtail our development program in this area significantly and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage in addressing this market opportunity.\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we received 100% of our revenues from our agreement with BARDA, for the development of 10150 as a MCM against Lung-ARS. These revenues have funded some of our personnel and other R&D costs and expenses. Pursuant to the BARDA Contract, we received approximately $10.4 million under the base period of the contract from February 2011 to April 2012. On April 16, 2012, we announced that BARDA had exercised two options under the BARDA Contract worth approximately $9.1 million. On September 17, 2013, we announced that BARDA had exercised $6.0 million in additional contract options. On May 07, 2014, we announced that BARDA had exercised a Contract Modification worth approximately $1.8 million. On June 26, 2015, we announced that BARDA had exercised $3.0 million in additional contract options under its advanced research and development contract for AEOL 10150. The June option exercise brings the total exercised contract value to date to approximately $30.3 million. We may receive up to an additional $88.1 million in options exercisable over the remaining years of the contract. If all of the options are exercised by BARDA, the total value of the contract would be approximately $118.4 million.\nUnder the terms of the BARDA Contract, BARDA may elect not to exercise some or all of the additional options. Because a significant portion of our current revenues are generated from the BARDA Contract, if BARDA does not exercise its options under the BARDA Contract, our ability to develop 10150 as an MCM for Lung-ARS could be negatively impacted, which could harm our competitive position and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In general, we believe that future exercise of options under the contract will depend on successful completion of tasks under exercised options and continued demonstration of efficacy.\nNecessary reliance on the \"Animal Rule\" in conducting trials is time-consuming and expensive.\nTo obtain FDA approval for our drug candidate for a bioterrorism indication under current FDA regulations, we are required to utilize animal model studies for efficacy and provide animal and human safety data under the \"Animal Rule.\" For many of the biological and chemical threats, animal models are not yet available, and as such we are developing, or will have to develop, appropriate animal models, which is a time-consuming and expensive research effort. Further, we may not be able to sufficiently demonstrate the animal correlation to the satisfaction of the FDA, as these corollaries are difficult to establish and are often unclear. The FDA may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies, refuse to approve our products, or place restrictions on our ability to commercialize those products. Further, other countries do not, at this time, have established criteria for review and approval of these types of products outside their normal review process; i.e., there is no \"Animal Rule\" equivalent, and consequently we may not be able to make a submission for marketing approval in foreign countries based on such animal data.\nAdditionally, few facilities in the U.S. and internationally have the capability to test animals with radiation, nerve agents, or other lethal biotoxins or chemical agents or otherwise assist us in qualifying the requisite animal models. We have to compete with other biodefense companies for access to this limited pool of highly specialized resources. We therefore may not be able to secure contracts to conduct the testing in a predictable timeframe, cost-effectively or at all.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing our drug candidates, we may not become profitable and manufacturing problems or side effects discovered at later stages can further increase costs of commercialization.\nAny drugs resulting from our research and development efforts may not become commercially available. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing our drug candidates, we may never generate sufficient or sustainable revenues to enable us to be profitable. Even if effective, a product that reaches the market may be subject to additional clinical trials, changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities or a change in labeling if we or others identify side effects or manufacturing problems after a product is on the market. This could harm sales of the affected products and could increase the cost and expenses of commercializing and marketing them. It could also lead to the suspension or revocation of regulatory approval for the products.\nWe and our contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\") will also be required to comply with the applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice (\"cGMP\") regulations. These regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the FDA. These facilities must be approved to supply licensed products to the commercial marketplace. We and our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable cGMP requirements and other FDA regulatory requirements. Should we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply, we could be subject to fines or other sanctions or could be prohibited from marketing any products we develop.\nPolitical or social factors may delay or impair our ability to market our products and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nProducts developed to treat diseases caused by, or to combat the threat of, bioterrorism will be subject to changing political and social environments. The political and social responses to bioterrorism have been unpredictable. Political or social pressures may delay or cause resistance to bringing our products to market or limit pricing of our products, which would harm our business. Changes to favorable laws, such as Project BioShield, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation limiting or restricting liability for medical products used to fight bioterrorism is new, and we cannot be certain that any such protection will apply to our products or if applied what the scope of any such coverage will be.\nThe U.S. Public Readiness Act was signed into law in December 2005 (the \"Public Readiness Act\") and creates general immunity for manufacturers of countermeasures, including security countermeasures (as defined in Section 319F-2(c)(1)(B) of the Public Readiness Act), when the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. The declaration is meant to provide general immunity from all claims under state or federal law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. Manufacturers are excluded from this protection in cases of willful misconduct. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may not make declarations that would cover any of our other drug candidates or the U.S. Congress may not act in the future to reduce coverage under the Public Readiness Act or it may repeal it altogether.\nUpon a declaration by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a compensation fund would be created to provide \"timely, uniform and adequate compensation to eligible individuals for covered injuries directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure.\" The \"covered injuries\" to which the program applies are defined as serious physical injuries or death. Individuals are permitted to bring a willful misconduct action against a manufacturer only after they have exhausted their remedies under the compensation program. A willful misconduct action could be brought against us if an individual(s) has exhausted his or her remedies under the compensation program, which could thereby expose us to liability. Furthermore, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may not issue a declaration under the Public Readiness Act to establish a compensation fund. We may also become subject to standard product liability suits and other third party claims if products we develop which fall outside of the Public Readiness Act cause injury or if treated individuals subsequently become infected or otherwise suffer adverse effects from such products.\nHealthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to extensive regulation, and from time to time legislative bodies and governmental agencies consider changes to such regulations that could have significant impact on industry participants. For example, in light of certain highly-publicized safety issues regarding certain drugs that had received marketing approval, the U.S. Congress is considering various proposals regarding drug safety, including some which would require additional safety studies and monitoring and could make drug development more costly. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to safety or other aspects of drug development may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are also affected by the efforts of governments, third-party payors and others to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare to consumers. In the United States and various foreign jurisdictions there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system, such as the Affordable Care Act and proposals relating to the reimportation of drugs into the U.S. from other countries (where they are then sold at a lower price) and government control of prescription drug pricing. The roll-out, pendency or approval of such proposals could affect our commercialization efforts and result in a decrease in our share price or limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic collaborations or licenses.\nWe will need to enter into collaborative arrangements for the manufacturing and marketing of our drug candidates, or we will have to develop the expertise, obtain the additional capital and invest the resources to perform those functions internally.\nWe do not have the staff or facilities to manufacture or market any of the drug candidates being developed in our catalytic antioxidant program. As a result, we will need to enter into collaborative arrangements to commercialize, manufacture and market products that we expect to emerge from our catalytic antioxidant program, or develop the expertise within Aeolus. We might not be successful in entering into such third party arrangements on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturing or marketing on acceptable terms, we may be delayed in our ability to commercialize products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Substantial additional funds and personnel would be required if we needed to establish our own manufacturing or marketing operations. We may not be able to obtain adequate funding or establish these capabilities in a cost-effective or timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to obtain or maintain patent and other intellectual property rights would allow others to develop and sell products similar to ours, which could impair our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to establish and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property, whether owned by us or licensed from third parties. We rely primarily on patents in the United States and in other key markets to protect our intellectual property. If we do not have adequate patent protection, other companies could develop and sell products that compete directly with ours, without incurring any liability to us. Patent prosecution, maintenance and enforcement on a global basis are time-consuming and expensive, and many of these costs must be incurred before we know whether a product covered by the claims can be successfully developed or marketed.\nEven if we expend considerable time and money on patent prosecution, a patent application may never issue as a patent. We can never be certain that we were the first to invent the particular technology or that we were the first to file a patent application for the technology because patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are not typically published for public inspection for at least 18 months from the date when they are filed. It is always possible that a competitor is pursuing a patent for the same invention in the United States as we are and has an earlier invention date. In some jurisdictions outside of the United States, priority of invention is determined by the earliest effective filing date, not the date of invention. Consequently, if a third party pursues the same invention and has an earlier filing date, patent protection outside the United States would be unavailable to us. Also, outside the United States, an earlier date of invention cannot overcome a date of publication that precedes the earliest effective filing date. Accordingly, the patenting of our proposed products would be precluded outside the United States if a prior publication anticipates the claims of a pending application, even if the date of publication is within a year of the filing of the pending application.\nEven if patents issue, the patent claims allowed might not be sufficiently broad to offer adequate protection for our technology against competitive products. Patent protection differs from country to country, giving rise to increased competition from other products in countries where patent coverage is either unavailable, weak or not adequately enforced, if enforced at all. Once a patent issues, we still face the risk that others will try to design around our patent or will try to challenge the validity of the patent. The cost of defending against a challenge to one or more of our patents could be substantial and even if we prevailed, there could be no assurance that we would recover damages.\nIf a third party were to bring an infringement claim against us, we would incur significant costs in our defense; if the claim were successful, we would need to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license from the successful patent holder, if available.\nOur business also depends on our ability to develop and market products without infringing on the proprietary rights of others or being in breach of our license agreements. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by a large number of patents, patent filings and frequent and protracted litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Many companies have numerous patents that protect their intellectual property rights. Third parties might assert infringement claims against us with respect to our drug candidates and future products. If litigation were required to determine the validity of a third party's claims, we could be required to spend significant time and financial resources, which could distract our management and prevent us from furthering our core business activities, regardless of the outcome. If we did not prevail in the litigation, we could be required to pay damages, license a third party's technology, which may not be possible on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or discontinue our own activities and develop non-infringing technology, any of which could prevent or significantly delay pursuit of our development activities.\nProtection of trade secret and confidential information is difficult, and loss of confidentiality could eliminate our competitive advantage.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and confidential information to protect our technology. We use confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators to maintain the proprietary nature of this technology. However, confidentiality agreements can be breached by the other party, which would make our trade secrets and proprietary know-how legally available for use by others. There is generally no adequate remedy for breach of confidentiality obligations. In addition, the competitive advantage afforded by trade secrets is limited because a third party can independently discover or develop something identical to our own trade secrets or know-how, without incurring any liability to us.\nIn addition, if our current or former employees, consultants or collaborators were to use information improperly obtained from others (even if unintentional), we may be subject to claims as to ownership and rights in any resulting know-how or inventions.\nIf we cannot retain or hire qualified personnel or maintain our collaborations, our programs could be delayed and may be discontinued.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had four full-time employees. We utilize consultants to assist with our operations and are highly dependent on the services of our executive officers. We do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance on any of our personnel. We also are dependent on our collaborators for our research and development activities. The loss of key executive officers or collaborators could delay progress in our research and development activities or result in their termination entirely.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific and managerial personnel. We face intense competition for these kinds of personnel from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. If we fail to identify, attract and retain personnel, we may be unable to continue the development of our drug candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could exceed our insurance coverage and deplete our cash resources.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries expose us to the risk of product liability claims alleging that use of our drug candidates caused an injury or harm. These claims can arise at any point in the development, testing, manufacture, marketing or sale of pharmaceutical products and may be made directly by patients involved in clinical trials of our products, by consumers or healthcare providers or by organizations selling our products. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend, even if the product did not actually cause the alleged injury or harm.\nInsurance covering product liability claims becomes increasingly expensive as a product candidate moves through the development pipeline to commercialization. We have limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and this coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against some or all potential losses due to liability, if any, or to the expenses associated with defending against liability claims. A product liability claim successfully asserted against us could exceed our insurance coverage, require us to use our own cash resources and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our licensing and other agreements with third parties require or might require us to maintain product liability insurance. If we cannot maintain acceptable amounts of coverage on commercially reasonable terms in accordance with the terms set forth in these agreements, the corresponding agreements would be subject to termination.\nThe costs of compliance with environmental, safety and similar laws could increase our cost of doing business or subject us to liability in the event of noncompliance.\nOur business is subject to regulation under state and federal laws regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and the use, generation, manufacture, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to comply with existing or future environmental and health and safety regulations. Our research activities involve the use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our procedures for handling such materials comply with applicable state and federal regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination, we could be liable for any resulting damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition that could materially impact our operating results.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. The pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and bioterrorism industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid and significant technological advancements. Many companies, research institutions and universities are working in a number of areas similar to our primary fields of interest to develop new products. There also is intense competition among companies seeking to acquire products that already are being marketed. Many of the companies with which we compete have or are likely to have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, technical, scientific, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than at least some of our present or future strategic partners or licensees.\nAs a result, these competitors may:\n\u00b7\nsucceed in developing competitive products sooner than us or our strategic partners or licensees;\n\u00b7\nobtain FDA and other regulatory approvals (including EUA approvals) for their products before approval of any of our products;\n\u00b7\nobtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit the development and commercialization of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\ndevelop products that are safer or more effective than our products;\n\u00b7\ndevote greater resources to marketing or selling their products;\n\u00b7\nintroduce or adapt more quickly to new technologies or scientific advances;\n\u00b7\nintroduce products that render our products obsolete;\n\u00b7\nwithstand price competition more successfully than us or our strategic partners or licensees;\n\u00b7\nnegotiate third-party strategic alliances or licensing arrangements more effectively; or\n\u00b7\ntake advantage of other opportunities more readily.\nCurrently, as discussed under \"Competition\" there are no drugs approved for Lung-ARS. Two drugs, Ebsriet (Roche) and OFEV (Boehringer-Ingelheim) are approved for use in treating IPF. There is one drug, Amifostine, approved for use in reducing side effects from radiation therapy. However, there are also many companies working to develop pharmaceuticals that act as radiation protection agents and as treatments for IPF.\nAcceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance will harm our business.\nEven if approved for marketing, our products may not achieve market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe receipt of regulatory approvals for the indications that we are studying;\n\u00b7\nthe establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products;\n\u00b7\nmarketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction, market penetration and pricing strategies of competing and future products; and\n\u00b7\ncoverage and reimbursement policies of governmental and other third-party payors such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators.\nPhysicians, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, purchase, utilize or recommend any of our products.\nWe may be required to make milestone payments and other payments relating to the commercialization of our products.\nOur agreements by which we acquired rights to our drug candidates provide for milestone payments by us upon the occurrence of certain regulatory filings and approvals related to the acquired products. In the event that we successfully develop our drug candidates, these milestone payments could be significant. In addition, our agreements require us to pay a royalty interest on worldwide sales. Also, any future license, collaborative or other agreements we may enter into in connection with our development and commercialization activities may require us to pay significant milestone, license and other payments in the future.\nWe are continually evaluating our business strategy, and may modify this strategy in light of developments in our business and other factors.\nWe continue to evaluate our business strategy and, as a result, may modify this strategy in the future. In this regard, we may, from time to time, focus our development efforts on different drug candidates or may delay or halt the development of our drug candidates. In addition, as a result of changes in our strategy, we may also change or refocus our existing drug discovery, development, commercialization and manufacturing activities.\nOur short-term investments, marketable securities and restricted investments, if any, are subject to certain risks which could materially adversely affect our overall financial position.\nWe invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and customarily in instruments which historically have been highly liquid and carried relatively low risk. However, the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption. Over the past few years, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. We maintain a portfolio of investments in short-term investments, marketable debt securities and restricted investments, which are recorded at fair value. Certain of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of the issuer. To minimize our exposure to credit risk, we invest in securities with strong credit ratings. Should any of our short-term investments, marketable securities or restricted investments lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it could materially and adversely affect our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise. Such financing may not be available on commercially attractive terms or at all.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which could leave us exposed to significant, uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. We currently maintain general liability, property, auto, workers' compensation, products liability, fiduciary and directors' and officers' insurance policies. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. For example, the premiums for our directors' and officers' insurance policy have increased in the past and may increase in the future, and this type of insurance may not be available on acceptable terms or at all in the future. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nWe may have a limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and tax credits may be limited if we undergo or have undergone an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as a result of changes in the ownership of outstanding stock. An ownership change generally occurs if the percentage of stock owned by one or more stockholders who own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the value of our outstanding stock (or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under Section 382 and the regulations promulgated thereunder) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of our outstanding stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change NOLs.\nWe are exposed to risks if we are unable to comply with changes to laws affecting public companies, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and also to increased costs associated with complying with such laws.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies in the U.S., including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, will cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements. Delays or a failure to comply with the new laws, rules and regulations could result in enforcement actions, the assessment of other penalties and civil suits. These laws and regulations make it more expensive for us under indemnities provided by us to our officers and directors and may make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including liability insurance for directors and officers; as such, we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, or as executive officers. We may be required to hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services - all of which could cause our general and administrative costs to increase beyond what we currently have planned.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.\nThe development, manufacturing, pricing, sales, coverage and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and other authorities within the United States and numerous entities outside of the United States. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices, governmental authorities may not find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of potentially applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, including suspension or termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of products from the market, significant fines, or other sanctions or litigation.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on U.S. Government Grants and Contracts\nEven with the BARDA Contract, we may not be able to fully fund our research and development of 10150 as a MCM for Lung-ARS.\nThe BARDA Contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee reimbursement contract that only reimburses certain specified activities that have been previously authorized by BARDA. Additional activities may be needed and, if so, BARDA may not reimburse us for these activities. Performance under the BARDA Contract requires that we comply with appropriate regulations and operational mandates. Our ability to be regularly and fully reimbursed for our activities will depend on our ability to comply and demonstrate compliance with such requirement.\nThe BARDA Contract award does not guarantee that we will be successful in future clinical trials or that 10150 will be approved by the FDA.\nThe BARDA Contract provides a cost-plus-fixed-fee reimbursement opportunity for certain specified clinical and development activities, but we remain fully responsible for conducting these activities. The award of BARDA Contract does not guarantee that any of these activities will be successful. Our inability to be successful with certain key clinical or development activities could jeopardize our ability to obtain FDA approval for 10150.\nMost of our immediately foreseeable future revenues are contingent upon grants, contracts or purchases from the U.S. government and we may not achieve sufficient, if any, revenues from these agreements to attain profitability.\nFor the foreseeable future, we believe our main customer, if any, will be national governments, primarily the U.S. government. However, we may not ultimately be successful in receiving any future revenues or grants from such governments. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain and we may have to compete with other companies for each contract. We may not be awarded any contracts to supply the U.S. or other governments with our drug candidates or products as such awards may be made, in whole or in part, to our competitors. If the U.S. government makes significant future contract awards for the supply to the Strategic National Stockpile of a competing product, our business will be harmed and it is unlikely that we will ultimately be able to supply that particular treatment or product to foreign governments or other third parties. Further, changes in government budgets and agendas, or advances by our competitors, may result in a decreased and de-prioritized emphasis on procuring the biodefense products we are developing.\nThe U.S. government's determination to award any contracts may be challenged by an interested party, such as another bidder, at the Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") or in federal court. If such a challenge is successful, a contract may be terminated.\nThe laws and regulations governing procurements of goods and services by the U.S. government provide procedures by which other bidders and other interested parties may challenge the award of a government contract. If we are awarded a government contract, such challenges or protests could be filed even if there are not any valid legal grounds on which to base the protest. If any such protests are filed, the government agency may decide to suspend our performance under the contract while such protests are being considered by the GAO or the applicable federal court, thus potentially delaying delivery of goods and services and payment. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable funds to defend any potential award. If a protest is successful, the government may be ordered to terminate the contract and reselect bids. The government could even be directed to award a potential contract to one of the other bidders.\nOur business may become subject to audit by the U.S. government and a negative audit could adversely affect our business.\nU.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the \"DCAA\"), routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nThe DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor's compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\ntermination of contracts;\n\u00b7\nforfeiture of profits;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of payments;\n\u00b7\nfines; and\n\u00b7\nsuspension or prohibition from conducting business with the U.S. government.\nIn addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nLaws and regulations affecting government contracts make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which can make it more difficult for us to retain our rights under these contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with government agencies. Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:\n\u00b7\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u00b7\nthe business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\nexport and import control laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nForeign governments typically also have laws and regulations governing contracts with their respective agencies. These foreign laws and regulations could affect how we conduct business and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. Any changes in applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to obtain contracts, which could limit our ability to conduct our business and materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nBecause we depend on clinical research centers and other contractors for clinical and non-clinical testing, including testing under the \"Animal Rule\", and for certain research and development activities, the results of our clinical trial, non-clinical animal efficacy studies, and research and development activities are largely beyond our control.\nThe nature of studies, clinical trials and our business strategy of outsourcing substantially all of our research and development and manufacturing work require that we rely on clinical research centers and other contractors to assist us with research and development, clinical and non-clinical testing (including animal efficacy studies under the \"Animal Rule\"), patient enrollment and other activities. As a result, our success depends largely on the success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities. Although we prequalify our contractors and believe that they are fully capable of performing their contractual obligations, we cannot directly control the adequacy and timeliness of the resources and expertise that they apply to these activities. Furthermore, we have to compete with other biodefense companies for access to this limited pool of highly specialized resources. If our contractors do not perform their obligations in an adequate and timely manner or we are unable to enter into contracts with them because of prior commitments to our competitors, the pace of clinical or non-clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug candidates could be significantly delayed and our prospects could be adversely affected.\nData obtained from clinical trials is susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory clearances.\nData already obtained, or obtained in the future, from pre-clinical studies, non-clinical studies and clinical trials does not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of an intended product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the drug candidate, which would result in delays to commercialization and could materially harm our business. Our studies and clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and our proposed drugs may not be approved for marketing.\nWe may encounter delays or rejections based on additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. We may encounter similar delays in foreign countries. If any of our products are approved for commercialization, sales of the products outside the U.S. would be subject to foreign regulatory approvals that vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be shorter or longer than that required for FDA approval, and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain requisite approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, and even if obtained, such approvals may not be on a timely basis, or they may not cover the uses that we request.\nEven if we do ultimately receive FDA approval for any of our drug candidates, these drug candidates will be subject to extensive ongoing regulation, including regulations governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, prescription and procurement quotas, record keeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal of any such drug. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or to comply with any applicable regulations could further delay or preclude development and commercialization of our drugs and subject us to enforcement action.\nUnfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which may be customary, may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGovernment contracts customarily contain provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to:\n\u00b7\nterminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u00b7\nunilaterally reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts, including equitable price adjustments;\n\u00b7\ncancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u00b7\ndecline to exercise an option to renew a contract;\n\u00b7\nexercise an option to purchase only the minimum amount specified in a contract;\n\u00b7\ndecline to exercise an option to purchase the maximum amount specified in a contract;\n\u00b7\nclaim rights to products, including intellectual property, developed under the contract;\n\u00b7\ntake actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;\n\u00b7\naudit and object to the contractor's contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u00b7\ndirect the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency;\n\u00b7\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act and False Statements Act; and\n\u00b7\ncontrol or prohibit the export of products.\nGenerally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the government's convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination.\nIf the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Some government contracts grant the government the right to use, for or on behalf of the U.S. government, any technologies developed by the contractor under the government contract. If we were to develop technology under a contract with such a provision, we might not be able to prohibit third parties, including our competitors, from using that technology in providing products and services to the government.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and are, and will continue to be, able to exercise significant influence over our affairs.\nAs of September 30, 2015, Xmark Opportunity Partners, LLC (\"Xmark\") possessed voting power over 97,931,944 shares, or 72.0%, of our outstanding common stock as of such date, through its management of Goodnow Capital, L.L.C. (\"Goodnow\"), Xmark Opportunity Fund, L.P., Xmark Opportunity Fund, Ltd. and Xmark JV Investment Partners, LLC (collectively, the \"Xmark Funds\"), and through a voting trust agreement by and among Biomedical Value Fund, L.P., Biomedical Value Fund, Ltd., Xmark and us (the \"Xmark Voting Trust\") with respect to 1,000,000 shares. As a result, Xmark is able to determine a significant part of the composition of our board of directors, holds significant voting power with respect to matters requiring stockholder approval and is able to exercise significant influence over our operations. The interests of Xmark may be different than the interests of other stockholders on these and other matters. This concentration of ownership also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could reduce the price of our common stock.\nDavid Cavalier, an employee and our Chairman of the board of directors and Mitchell D. Kaye, a Director, are affiliated with Xmark, which possessed voting power of 72.0% of our outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2015. Accordingly, Mr. Cavalier and Mr. Kaye currently have, and will continue to have, a significant influence over the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers and directors and holders of greater than five percent of our outstanding common stock, together with entities that may be deemed affiliates of, or related to, such persons or entities, beneficially owned greater than 85.6% of our outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2015. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. The interests of our current major stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders and they may take actions to advance their respective interests to the detriment of other stockholders.\nWe may need to sell additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities to meet our capital requirements and these future sales could cause dilution and adversely affect our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of capital stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional common stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances.\nIn the event of the conversion of our preferred stock and exercises of currently outstanding options and warrants, the ownership interests of our current stockholders could be substantially diluted, which would reduce the market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had 135,930,068 shares of common stock outstanding. We may grant to our employees, directors and consultants, options to purchase shares of our common stock under our 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. In addition, as of September 30, 2015, options to purchase 12,164,591 shares were outstanding at exercise prices ranging from $0.23 to $1.19 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $0.42 per share, and 12,835,409 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. In addition, as of September 30, 2015, warrants to purchase 16,845,664 shares of common stock were outstanding at exercise prices ranging from $0.25 to $2.50 per share, with a weighted exercise price of $0.27 per share.\nIn connection with prior collaborations and financing transactions, we also issued 526,080 shares of Series B preferred stock and warrants to purchase 896,037 shares of Series B preferred stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share to affiliates of Elan Corporation, plc (\"Elan\"). These securities generally are exercisable and convertible at the option of the Elan affiliates. Each preferred share is convertible into one share of common stock. The warrant has a term of five years, a cashless exercise provision and customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock combination, reorganizations and similar events. The conversion of all or a portion of these securities would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nOur common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, is illiquid and is characterized by low and/or erratic trading volume, and the intraday per share price of our common stock has fluctuated from $0.22 to $0.55 during the last two fiscal years.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol \"AOLS.\" An active public market for our common stock is unlikely to develop as long as we are not listed on a national securities exchange. Even if listed, the market for our stock may be impaired because of the limited number of investors, the significant ownership stake of Xmark, and our small market capitalization, which is less than that authorized for investment by many institutional investors.\nHistorically, the public market for our common stock has been characterized by low and/or erratic trading volume, often resulting in price volatility. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 the average daily trading volume for our common stock was approximately 32,000 shares. In addition, the price of our common stock has been volatile. Our common stock had a closing price of $0.24 on October 1, 2014 and ended fiscal year 2015 at a closing price of $0.24. During the twelve month period ended September 30, 2015, our common stock had a low closing price of $0.20, which occurred on October 7, 2014, and had a high closing price of $0.41, which occurred on May 1, 2015.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations due to factors that we cannot control, including the results of preclinical and clinical testing of our products under development, decisions by collaborators regarding product development, regulatory developments, market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, future announcements concerning our competitors, adverse developments concerning proprietary rights, public concern as to the safety or commercial value of any products and general economic conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuation unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations can adversely affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.\nIf registration rights that we have previously granted are exercised, or if we grant additional registration rights in the future, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nUpon receiving notice from Elan, we are obligated to register with the SEC shares of common stock underlying the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Elan affiliates. If these securities are registered with the SEC, they may be sold in the open market. We expect that we also will be required to register any securities sold in future private financings. The sale of a significant amount of shares in the open market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or become highly volatile.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a prohibition on certain actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue up to 7,150,000 shares of \"blank check\" preferred stock without stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors has the power to issue shares without stockholder approval, and such shares can be issued with such rights, preferences, and limitations as may be determined by our board of directors. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of any holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid on the common stock for the foreseeable future. The payment of any cash dividend by us will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, capital, regulatory requirements and financial condition. Furthermore, the terms of some of our financing arrangements directly limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 83146, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AOLS"}
