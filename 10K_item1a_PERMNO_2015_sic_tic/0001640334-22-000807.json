{"cik": "895464", "company": "Yubo International Biotech Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following section lists the key current risk factors as of the date of this filing that may have a direct and material impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Corporate Structure\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations, and rules relating to the agreements that establish the VIE structure for our operations in China, including potential future actions by the PRC government, which could affect the enforceability of our contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing and, consequently, significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. If the PRC government finds that the contractual arrangements that establish the structure for operating our business in China do not comply with PRC laws and regulations, or if these regulations or their interpretations change in the future, we could be subjected to severe consequences, including the nullification of such agreements and the relinquishment of our interest in the VIE.\nCurrent PRC laws and regulations impose certain restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in medical institutions which our stem cell bank relates to, and in the development and application of technologies for diagnosis and treatment of human stem cells and genes, which our stem cell bank and endometrial stem cell bank business relates to. Pursuant to the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) issued by the NDRC and MOFCOM on December 27, 2021, which came into force on January 1, 2022, foreign investment are allowed in PRC medical institutions only through joint venture entities, and the foreign shareholding in these entities is limited to 70.0%, which percentage was stipulated in the Interim Administrative Measures on Sino-Foreign Equity Medical Institutions and Sino-Foreign Cooperative Medical Institutions, or the JV Interim Measures. Additionally, certain industries are specifically prohibited for foreign investment, including the development and application of technologies for diagnosis and treatment of human stem cells and genes.\nConsidering the foreign investment restrictions that may be applicable to our business, we conduct our stem cell bank and endometrial stem cell bank business in China through the VIE. The VIE structure through contractual arrangements has been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, such that if our businesses are determined to be subject to the foreign investment restrictions, we can obtain necessary license, for example, the Practice License of Medical Institutions, in the industry currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China.\nOn March 15, 2019, the Foreign Investment Law was formally passed by the thirteenth National People\u2019s Congress and it became effective on January 1, 2020. The Foreign Investment Law replaced the Law on Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law on Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures and the Law on Foreign-Capital Enterprises and became the legal foundation for foreign investment in the PRC. The Foreign Investment Law stipulates certain forms of foreign investment and defines enterprises incorporated within PRC with complete or partial foreign investment as foreign-invested enterprises or \u201cFIEs.\u201d However, the Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly stipulate contractual arrangements such as those we rely on as a form of foreign investment.\nThe 2019 PRC Foreign Investment Law further specifies that foreign investments shall be conducted in line with the \u201cnegative list\u201d to be issued by or approved to be issued by the State Council. This means that an FIE would not be allowed to make investments in prohibited industries in the \u201cnegative list,\u201d while the FIE must satisfy certain conditions stipulated in the \u201cnegative list\u201d for investment in restricted industries. As pursuant to the negative list issued by the NDRC and MOFCOM taking effect on January 1, 2022, medical services is a restricted industry and foreign investment are allowed in PRC medical institutions only through joint venture entities, i.e., an FIE in which foreign ownership is limited to 70.0%. Additionally, certain industries are specifically prohibited for foreign investment, including the development and application of technologies for diagnosis and treatment of human stem cells and genes, which means, pursuant to the Foreign Investment Law, FIEs are prohibited from practicing such businesses in China.\nConsidering the above, Yubo International Biotech Limited, Platinum and Platinum HK are considered as foreign investors under the 2019 PRC Foreign Investment Law, Yubo WOFE is deemed as an FIE. Accordingly, none of such entities are eligible to provide such restricted services related to our businesses, such as medical services. As a result, we will conduct such business activities through the VIE and Chinese operating company, Yubo Beijing. Since Yubo Beijing is not an FIE, Yubo Beijing will be able to apply and hold license as medical institution as other PRC companies and provide medical services which are otherwise restricted to FIEs.\nNotwithstanding the above, the Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes \u201cforeign investors investing through any other methods under laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council.\u201d Future laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council may possibly regard contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. If this happens, it is uncertain whether our contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing, its subsidiaries and shareholders would be recognized as foreign investment, or whether our contractual arrangements would be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment access requirements. Therefore, there is no guarantee that our contractual arrangements, or Yubo Beijing\u2019s business will not be adversely affected.\nTo comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our stem cell bank and endometrial stem cell bank business in China through the VIE, Yubo Beijing. We, through Yubo WFOE, our wholly owned subsidiary in China, entered into a series of contractual arrangements with the VIE and its ultimate shareholders, in order to (i) exercise effective management over the VIE, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the VIE, and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the VIE when and to the extent permitted by PRC law. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we are deemed, for accounting purpose only, the primary beneficiary of the VIE and hence consolidate its financial results under GAAP. Although the structure we have adopted is consistent with long-standing practice in certain industries, is also adopted by some of our peers in China, and our contractual agreements with Yubo Beijing have not been tested in a court of law, the PRC government may not agree that these arrangements comply with PRC license, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies, or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. The VIE hold the licenses, approvals and key assets that are essential for the operations and we, as a U.S. holding company, do not have any direct busines operations in China, nor do we have any title to or ownership interest in such licenses, approvals and key assets.\nWe believe: (i) the ownership structures of the VIE in China currently do not result in any violation of the applicable PRC laws or regulations currently in effect, and (ii) subject to the risks as disclosed in the section headed \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\u201d, the contractual arrangements between WFOE, the VIE and its respective equity holders governed by PRC laws are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect and do not violate any applicable PRC laws, rule or regulation currently in effect. There are, however, substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations. The relevant PRC regulatory authorities have broad discretion in determining whether a particular contractual structure violates PRC laws and regulations. Thus, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that the VIE structure does not violate PRC laws or regulations. If we are found in violation of any PRC laws or regulations or if the contractual arrangements among WFOE, the VIE and its respective equity holders are determined as illegal or invalid by any PRC court, arbitral tribunal or regulatory authorities, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nrevoking the agreements constituting the contractual arrangements;\n\u00b7\nrevoking our business and operating licenses;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to discontinue or restrict operations;\n\u00b7\nrestricting our right to collect revenue;\n\u00b7\nshutting down all or part of our websites or services;\n\u00b7\nlevying fines on us and/or confiscating the proceeds that they deem to have been obtained through non-compliant operations;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to restructure the operations in such a way as to compel us to establish a new enterprise, re-apply for the necessary licenses or relocate our businesses, staff and assets;\n\u00b7\nimposing additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply;\n\u00b7\nrestricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from public offering or other financing activities to finance our business and operations in China; or\n\u00b7\ntaking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business.\nFurthermore, any of the assets under the name of any record holder of equity interest in the VIE, including such equity interest, may be put under court custody in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings against that record holder. We cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed of in accordance with the contractual arrangements. In addition, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced to impose additional requirements that may impose additional challenges to our corporate structure and contractual arrangements. The occurrence of any of these events or the imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our precision oncology service business. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties causes us to be unable to direct the activities of such VIE and its subsidiaries or the right to receive their economic benefits, we would no longer be able to consolidate such VIE into our financial statements, thus adversely affecting our results of operation. In addition, it is unclear what impact the PRC government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of Yubo Beijing in our consolidated financial statements, if the PRC governmental authorities find our legal structure and contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing to be in violation of PRC laws, rules and regulations. If any of these penalties results in our inability to direct the activities of Yubo Beijing that most significantly impact its economic performance and/or our failure to receive the economic benefits from Yubo Beijing or its subsidiaries, we may not be able to consolidate Yubo Beijing and/or its subsidiaries into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. If we are unable to claim our right to control the assets of Yubo Beijing, our Class A common share may decline in value or become worthless.\nWe currently conduct our business primarily through contractually arrangements with the PRC operating entity, and our management of the day-to-day business operations of such PRC entity pursuant to contracts, to comply with Chinese law, may not be as effective as conducting business through direct equity ownership of such PRC entity due to uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently conduct a substantial portion of our business primarily through our contractually arrangements with the PRC operating entity, Yubo Beijing. PRC laws and regulations govern Yubo Beijing\u2019s operations in the PRC. The PRC operating entity is generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in the PRC and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises (\u201cWFOEs\u201d). Although members of our executive management team and our shareholders include the executive officers and owners of the PRC operating entity, because we do not directly own such PRC operating entity, we may encounter problems enforcing our rights to manage the business affairs and day-to-day business operations of such entity. If we find it necessary to take legal action in the PRC to enforce our rights under our contracts with the PRC operating entity, we will be subject to the uncertainties of the PRC legal system, where prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in PRC.\nHowever, the PRC has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in the PRC. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their non-binding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation, if any, of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in the PRC, regardless of outcome, may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In the event we are unable to enforce our contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing or we experience significant delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective management over our affiliated entities or Yubo Beijing. Our contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing may not be as effective in ensuring our management over the relevant portion of Yubo Beijing\u2019s business operations as direct ownership would be, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur contractual arrangements with Yubo Beijing and its shareholders may not be as effective in providing management over these entities as direct ownership.\nWe have no equity ownership interest in Yubo Beijing as we rely on the contractual arrangements of the VIE agreements to operate Yubo Beijing. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing management over Yubo Beijing as direct ownership. For example, Yubo Beijing could fail to take actions required for the business or fail to pay amounts owed under the contracts to Yubo WFOE despite its contractual obligation to do so. If Yubo Beijing fails to perform its obligation under the VIE agreements, we may have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, which may not be effective.\nTransactions among our affiliates are subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and a finding that we or any of our consolidated entities owe additional taxes could have a material adverse impact on our net income.\nUnder PRC law, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If any of the transactions we have entered into among our consolidated entities are challenged by the PRC tax authorities to be not on an arm\u2019s-length basis, or to result in an unreasonable reduction in our PRC tax obligations, the PRC tax authorities have the authority to disallow our tax deduction claims, adjust the profits and losses of our respective PRC consolidated entities and assess late payment fees and other penalties. Our net income may be materially reduced if our tax liabilities increase or if we are otherwise assessed late payment fees or other penalties.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nThe PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the China operations of an offshore holding company, such as us. Therefore, Yubo Beijing\u2019s business face potential uncertainty from the PRC government\u2019s policy. Changes in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions, or government policies could materially and adversely affect our or Yubo Beijing\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAll of Yubo Beijing\u2019s operations are located in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the China operations of an offshore holding company, such as us.\nThe economic, political and social conditions in the PRC differ from those in more developed countries in many respects, including structure, government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange, capital reinvestment, allocation of resources, rate of inflation and trade balance position. Before the adoption of its reform and opening up policies in 1978, the PRC was primarily a planned economy. In recent years, the PRC government has been reforming the PRC economic system and government structure. For example, the PRC government has implemented economic reform and measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces in the development of the PRC economy in the past three decades. These reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social prospects. Economic reform measures, however, may be adjusted, modified or applied inconsistently from industry to industry or across different regions of the country.\nWe cannot predict whether the resulting changes will have any adverse effect on our or Yubo Beijing\u2019s current or future business, financial condition or results of operations. Despite these economic reforms and measures, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industrial development, allocation of natural and other resources, production, pricing and management of currency, and there can be no assurance that the PRC government will continue to pursue a policy of economic reform or that the direction of reform will continue to be market friendly.\nOur ability to successfully expand our business operations in the PRC depends on a number of factors, including macro-economic and other market conditions. Demand for Yubo Beijing\u2019s services and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u00b7\npolitical instability or changes in social conditions of the PRC;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws, regulations, and administrative directives or the interpretation thereof;\n\u00b7\nmeasures which may be introduced to control inflation or deflation; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in the rate or method of taxation.\nThese factors are affected by a number of variables which are beyond our control.\nYubo Beijing\u2019s business might be subject to various evolving PRC laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity, data privacy and data security. Failure of cybersecurity, data privacy and data security compliance could subject Yubo Beijing to penalties, damage its reputation and brand and harm its business and results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements on cybersecurity, data security and data privacy in China are constantly evolving and can be subject to varying interpretations or significant changes, resulting in uncertainties about the scope of Yubo Beijing\u2019s responsibilities in that regard. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect from September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for a security review procedure for the data activities that may affect national security. Furthermore, Measures for Cybersecurity Review, which became effective on June 1, 2020, set forth the cybersecurity review mechanism for critical information infrastructure operators, and provided that critical information infrastructure operators who intend to purchase internet products and services that affect or may affect national security shall be subject to a cybersecurity review. On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (\u201cCAC\u201d) published the revised Measures for Cybersecurity Review (\u201cCRM\u201d), which further restates and expands the applicable scope of the cybersecurity review. The revised CRM took effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the revised CRM, if a network platform operator holding personal information of over one million users seeks for \u201cforeign\u201d listing, it must apply for the cybersecurity review, and operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services are also obligated to apply for the cybersecurity review for such purchasing activities. Although the CRM provides no further explanation on the extent of \u201cnetwork platform operator\u201d and \u201cforeign\u201d listing, we do not believe we are obligated to apply for a cybersecurity review pursuant to the revised CRM, considering that (i) we are not in possession of or otherwise holding personal information of over one million users and it is also very unlikely that we will reach such threshold in the near future; and (ii) as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not received any notice or determination from applicable PRC governmental authorities identifying it as a critical information infrastructure operator or requiring us to go through cybersecurity review or similar government reviews. That being said, considering that the revised CRM empowers the cybersecurity review office to initiate cybersecurity review when they believe any particular data processing activities \u201caffect or may affect national security\u201d, and that the revised CRM is new, it is uncertain whether the competent government authorities will deem that Yubo Beijing\u2019s data processing activities may affect national security and thus initiating the cybersecurity review against Yubo Beijing\u2019s businesses, and whether the competent government authorities, including the CAC, will adopt new laws, regulations or rules related to the revised CRM subjecting Yubo Beijing or its business to the cybersecurity review. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not be subject to the cybersecurity review in the future. If a cybersecurity review is determined to apply to us in the future, we may be required to suspend our operations or experience other disruptions to our operations. Cybersecurity review could also result in negative publicity with respect to our Company and diversion of our managerial and financial resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure of cybersecurity, data privacy and data security compliance which may be identified during any of such cybersecurity review could subject Yubo Beijing to penalties, damage its reputation and brand, and harm its business and results of operations.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, which took effect in November 2021. The Personal Information Protection Law provides that any entity involving processing of personal information (\u201cPersonal Information Processer\u201d) shall take various measures to prevent the disclosure, modification or losing of the personal information processed by such entity, including, but not limited to, formulating a related internal management system and standard of operation, conducting classified management of personal information, taking safety technology measures to encrypt and de-identify the processed personal information, providing regular safety training and education for staff and formulating a personal information safety emergency accident plan. The Personal Information Protection Law further provides that a Personal Information Processer shall conduct a prior evaluation of the impact of personal information protection before the occurrence of various situations, including, but not limited to, processing of sensitive personal information (personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, may lead to discrimination against an individual or serious harm to an individual\u2019s personal or property safety, including information on an individual\u2019s ethnicity, religious beliefs, personal biological characteristics, medical health, financial accounts, personal whereabouts), using personal information to make automated decisions and providing personal information to any overseas entity. Yubo Beijing\u2019s business involves the processing of personal information of customers using Yubo Beijing\u2019s healthcare products and receiving Yubo Beijing\u2019s services, which may be deemed as sensitive personal information. If Yubo Beijing does not take measures to review and improve its mechanisms in protecting personal information after the new Personal Information Protection Law takes effect, failure of personal information protection compliance could subject Yubo Beijing to penalties, damage its reputation and brand and harm its business and results of operations.\nThe medical industry in China is highly regulated and such regulations are subject to change which may affect approval and commercialization of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products and services.\nAll of Yubo Beijing\u2019s research and development operations and manufacturing facilities are in China, which we believe confers clinical, commercial and regulatory advantages. The medical industry in China is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, encompassing the approval, registration, manufacturing, packaging, licensing and marketing of new drugs. Yubo Beijing\u2019s products that are categorized as medical devices will require manufacturing and distribution license for the respective manufacturing and distribution activities and if Yubo Beijing\u2019s services are categorized as medical services, Yubo Beijing will be required to apply and hold a Practice License of Medical Institutions. For example, under PRC law, before Yubo Beijing enters into a clinical trial agreement with a PRC partner, the parties are required to obtain an approval for projects of international collaboration in respect of human genetic resources in order to utilize genetic material contained in biological samples collected from Chinese human subjects. Furthermore, under relevant PRC laws, a license for use of laboratory animals is required for performing experimentation on animals. Any failure of fully comply with such requirement may result in the invalidation of our experimental data. In recent years, the regulatory framework in China regarding the medical industry has undergone significant changes, and we expect that it will continue to undergo significant changes. Any such changes or amendments may result in increased compliance costs on Yubo Beijing\u2019s business or cause delays in or prevent the successful development or commercialization of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products in China and reduce the current benefits we believe are available to Yubo Beijing from developing and manufacturing products and medical devices in China. PRC authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the medical industry and any failure by Yubo Beijing or its partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the suspension or termination of Yubo Beijing\u2019s business activities in China. We believe Yubo Beijing\u2019s strategy and approach are aligned with the PRC government\u2019s regulatory policies, but we cannot ensure that Yubo Beijing\u2019s strategy and approach will continue to be aligned.\nYubo Beijing faces risks associated with uncertainties relating to Regulation for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources.\nThe collection, preservation, usage and outbound provision of human genetic resources in the PRC are governed by Regulation for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources, or HGR Regulation, except for activities relating to human genetic resources conducted for some specific purposes including clinical diagnosis and treatment. We believe that the stem cell bank is both for the purpose of clinical diagnosis and treatment, so that such activities relating to human genetic resources in our diagnosis business or early screening business may not be governed by HGR Regulation. However, we cannot assure you that the stem cell bank will be continuously deemed as conducted for the purpose of clinical diagnosis and treatment by the relevant government authority. Meanwhile, the endometrial stem cell bank in the development services are governed by HGR Regulation.\nPursuant to HGR Regulation, there are some limitations for foreign entities, individuals and such entities established or actually controlled thereby (\u201cRestricted Entities\u201d, and each, a \u201cRestricted Entity\u201d) to engage in activities relating to human genetic resources. For example, the Restricted Entity is not allowed to collect or preserve human genetic resources of China, while it is prohibited from using human genetic resources of China unless that such Restricted Entity have obtained an approval from relevant government authority or have filed with relevant government authority for international cooperation with a domestic entity. Taking into consideration of our consultation with a competent government authority, among others, although an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by foreign persons through shareholding ownership would be deemed as a Restricted Entity, HGR Regulation remains unclear as to whether a VIE entity controlled by a wholly foreign owned enterprise through contractual arrangements would be deemed as a Restricted Entity. We cannot assure you that Yubo Beijing, as a VIE, will not be deemed as Restricted Entities in the future, given the lack of clear statutory interpretation regarding HGR Regulation. If Yubo Beijing is deemed as a Restricted Entity by relevant government authority, we will be required to obtain approvals or file with relevant government authority which could result in additional cost and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our management named in this Annual Report based on foreign laws.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations in China through the VIE, Yubo Beijing. In addition, many of our senior executive officers and directors reside within China for a significant portion of the time and some of them are PRC nationals. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process upon us, Yubo Beijing, or those persons inside China. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us, Yubo Beijing and our officers and directors. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us, Yubo Beijing or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state.\nThe recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other forms of written arrangement with the United States that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, the PRC courts will not enforce a foreign judgment against us, Yubo Beijing or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws or national sovereignty, security or the public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China.\nIt may be difficult for you or overseas regulators, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, the Commission, and other authorities of the United States, to conduct investigations or collect evidence within China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to obtaining information, documents and materials needed for regulatory investigations or litigation outside China or otherwise with respect to foreign entities. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such regulatory cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. Accordingly, without the consent of the competent PRC securities regulators and relevant authorities, no entity or individual may provide the documents and materials relating to securities business activities to overseas parties. While detailed interpretation of or implementing rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests.\nAlthough our audit report is prepared by U.S. auditors who are currently inspected by the PCAOB, there is no guarantee that future audit reports will be prepared by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB and, as such, future investors may be deprived of such inspections, which could result in limitations or restrictions to our access of the U.S. capital markets. Furthermore, trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act or the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the SEC subsequently determines our audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely or the SEC identifies us as a Commission-Identified Issuer, and as a result, U.S. national securities exchanges, such as the Nasdaq, may determine to delist our securities. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years, instead of three as currently provided by the HFCAA.\nAs an auditor of companies that are registered with the SEC and publicly traded in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required under the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Although most of our operations are based in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese government authorities, our U.S. auditor is currently inspected by the PCAOB.\nInspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating auditors\u2019 audits and their quality control procedures. As a result, to the extent that any component of our auditor\u2019s work papers is or becomes located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB. As a result, investors would be deprived of such PCAOB inspections, which could result in limitations or restrictions to our access of the U.S. capital markets.\nAs part of a continued regulatory focus in the United States on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law, in particular under Chinese law, in June 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced bills in both houses of the U.S. Congress which, if passed, would require the SEC to maintain a list of issuers for which PCAOB is not able to inspect or investigate the audit work performed by a foreign public accounting firm completely. The proposed Ensuring Quality Information and Transparency for Abroad-Based Listings on our Exchanges Act prescribes increased disclosure requirements for these issuers and, beginning in 2025, the delisting from U.S. national securities exchanges such as the Nasdaq of issuers included on the SEC\u2019s list for three consecutive years. It is unclear if this proposed legislation will be enacted. Furthermore, there have been recent deliberations within the U.S. government regarding potentially limiting or restricting China-based companies from accessing U.S. capital markets. On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the HFCA Act, which includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor\u2019s local jurisdiction. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the HFCA Act on December 2, 2020, and the HFCA Act was signed into law on December 18, 2020. Additionally, in July 2020, the U.S. President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets issued recommendations for actions that can be taken by the executive branch, the SEC, the PCAOB or other federal agencies and department with respect to Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges and their audit firms, in an effort to protect investors in the United States. In response, on November 23, 2020, the SEC issued guidance highlighting certain risks (and their implications to U.S. investors) associated with investments in China-based issuers and summarizing enhanced disclosures the SEC recommends China-based issuers make regarding such risks. On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies us as a Commission-Identified Issuer (as defined in the final rules) under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC, and the SEC could prohibit the trading of our securities on national securities exchanges if we are identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer. Under the HFCA Act, our securities may be prohibited from trading on the Nasdaq or other U.S. stock exchanges if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in our shares being delisted. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted PCAOB Rule 6100, Board Determinations Under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, implementing the HFCA Act, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCA Act, whether the Board is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. PCAOB Rule 6100 establishes the manner of the PCAOB\u2019s determinations; the factors the PCAOB will evaluate and the documents and information it will consider when assessing whether a determination is warranted; the form, public availability, effective date, and duration of such determinations; and the process by which the PCAOB will reaffirm, modify or vacate any such determinations. Chairman Gensler emphasized, in his October 5, 2021 testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services, that the PCAOB\u2019s adoption of Rule 6100 was \u201can important step to meet its requirements under the [HFCA Act] to protect U.S. investors;\u201d that \u201cwe remain on track to finalize its required rulemaking before the end of the year;\u201d and that \u201cit is critical that the [Securities and Exchange] Commission and the PCAOB work together to ensure that the audits of foreign companies accessing U.S. capital markets play by the same rules.\u201d On November 5, 2021, the SEC announced that it has approved Rule 6100.\nAdditionally, Nasdaq recently adopted additional listing criteria applicable to companies that primarily operate in jurisdictions where local regulators impose secrecy laws, national security laws or other laws that restrict U.S. regulators from accessing information relating to the issuer, or a Restrictive Market. Under the new rule, whether a jurisdiction permits PCAOB inspection would be a factor in determining whether a jurisdiction is deemed by the Nasdaq to be a Restrictive Market. China will likely be determined to be a Restrictive Market and, as a result, the Nasdaq may impose on us additional continued listing criteria or deny continued listing of our securities on the Nasdaq. While we understand that there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with requirements imposed by U.S. regulators or Nasdaq. Although we are committed to complying with the rules and regulations applicable to listed companies in the United States, we are currently unable to predict the potential impact on our listed status by the rules that may be adopted by the SEC under the HFCA Act (or, if enacted into law, the AHFCA Act). Delisting of our shares would force holders of our shares to sell their shares. The market price of our shares could be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of these executive or legislative actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment towards, companies with significant operations in China that are listed in the United States, regardless of whether these executive or legislative actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance.\nDividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC may be subject to PRC withholding tax, which could materially and adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay our shareholders.\nThe PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law classifies enterprises as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that an income tax rate of 20% may be applicable to dividends payable to non-resident investors, which (i) do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or (ii) have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The State Council of the PRC reduced such rate to 10% through the implementation regulations of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law. Further, pursuant to the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement between Hong Kong and Mainland China, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, and the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties issued in February 2009 by the State Administration of Taxation of the PRC, or the SAT, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in a company in China at all times during the 12-month period immediately prior to obtaining a dividend from such company, the 10% withholding tax on dividends is reduced to 5% provided that certain other conditions and requirements under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable PRC laws are satisfied at the discretion of relevant PRC tax authority.\nIf our Cayman Islands subsidiary and our Hong Kong subsidiary are considered as non-resident enterprises and our Hong Kong subsidiary is considered as a Hong Kong resident enterprise under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied relevant conditions and requirements, then the dividends paid to our Hong Kong subsidiary by its PRC subsidiary may be subject to the reduced income tax rate of 5% under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement. However, based on the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. In addition, based on the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties, effective from April 1, 2018, under certain conditions a company cannot be defined as a beneficial owner under the treaty and thus are not entitled to the abovementioned reduced income tax rate of 5% under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement. If we are required under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law to pay income tax for any dividends we receive from our subsidiaries in China, or if our Hong Kong subsidiary is determined by PRC government authority as receiving benefits from reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, it would materially and adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay to our shareholders.\nIf we are classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we and our non-PRC shareholders could be subject to unfavorable tax consequences, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside the PRC with \u201cde facto management body\u201d within the PRC is considered a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The implementation rules define the term \u201cde facto management body\u201d as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In 2009, SAT issued a circular, known as SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \u201cde facto management body\u201d of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the SAT\u2019s general position on how the \u201cde facto management body\u201d text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its \u201cde facto management body\u201d in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise\u2019s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise\u2019s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of board members with voting rights or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.\nWe believe that we are not a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term \u201cde facto management body.\u201d If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to withhold a 10% tax from dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of the common stock. In addition, non-resident enterprise shareholders, including our common stock holders, may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 10% on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of common stock or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to our non-PRC individual shareholders, including our common stock holders, and any gain realized on the transfer of common stock or ordinary shares by such shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 20%, which in the case of dividends may be withheld at source. Any PRC tax liability may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty. However, it is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our common stock or ordinary shares.\nIn addition to the uncertainty as to the application of the \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not amend or revise the taxation laws, rules and regulations to impose stricter tax requirements or higher tax rates. Any of such changes could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on foreign exchange and the ability to transfer cash between entities, across borders and to U.S. investors may affect the value of your investment.\nCurrently, the RMB cannot be freely converted into any foreign currency. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Our income is received in RMB and shortages in foreign currencies may restrict our ability to pay dividends or other payments, or otherwise satisfy our foreign currency denominated obligations, if any. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, for most capital account items, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of the Class A common stock.\nOur cash dividends, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax. See \u201c-If we are classified as a \u2018resident enterprise\u2019 of China under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we and our non-PRC shareholders could be subject to unfavorable tax consequences, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected\u201d above.\nRelevant PRC laws and regulations permit the PRC companies to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, our PRC subsidiaries and Yubo Beijing can only distribute dividends upon approval of the shareholders after we have met the PRC requirements for appropriation to the statutory reserves. As a result of these and other restrictions under the PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and Yubo Beijing are restricted to transfer a portion of their net assets to us either in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Even though we currently do not require any such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC subsidiaries or Yubo Beijing for working capital and other funding purposes, we may in the future require additional cash resources from our PRC subsidiaries or Yubo Beijing due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and developments, or merely declare and pay dividends to or distributions to our shareholders. See \u201cItem 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Registrant Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividends and Other Distributions\u201d for a diagram illustrating the typical cash flow among our main subsidiaries, our WFOE, and Yubo Beijing, the VIE.\nFluctuation in exchange rates could have a negative effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions in China and by China\u2019s foreign exchange policies. Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. On November 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, completed the regular five-year review of the basket of currencies that make up the Special Drawing Right, or the SDR, and decided that with effect from October 1, 2016, the RMB is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the SDR basket as a fifth currency, along with the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, the RMB has depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging U.S. dollar and persistent capital outflows of China. With the development of the foreign exchange market and progress toward interest rate liberalization and RMB internationalization, the PRC government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system, and we cannot assure you that the RMB will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency or to convert foreign currency into RMB.\nPRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents and enterprises may increase our administrative burden and restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activity. If our PRC resident and enterprise shareholders fail to make any required applications and filings under such regulations, we may be unable to distribute profits to such shareholders and may become subject to liability under PRC law.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which replaces the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Round-tripping Investment via Overseas Special Purpose, or SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities, to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we may make in the future.\nUnder SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments in offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, are required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV, is required to update its registration with the local branch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any change of basic information or material events. If any PRC resident shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration or to update the registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions into its subsidiaries in China. In February 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, shall be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. Qualified banks should examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE.\nWe may not be aware of the identities of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. To our knowledge, some of our beneficial owners have not complied with SAFE registration requirements under SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules on time or at all, sometimes due to reasons beyond their control. However, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot compel them to comply with SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any required registration under SAFE Circular 37 and any amendment will be completed in a timely manner, or at all. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their foreign exchange registrations pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules, or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules, may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiary to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiary and limit our PRC subsidiary\u2019s ability to distribute dividends to us. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, as these foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations and their interpretation and implementation have been constantly evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border investments and transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nThe M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe M&A Rules and relevant regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. The M&A Rules require that the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have or may have an impact on the national economic security; or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. The approval from MOFCOM shall be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies.\nThe Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, or NPC, which became effective in August 2008, requires that when a concentration of undertakings occurs and reaches statutory thresholds, the undertakings concerned shall file a prior notification with MOFCOM. Without the clearance from MOFCOM, no concentration of undertakings shall be implemented and effected. Mergers, acquisitions or contractual arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must also be notified in advance to the MOFCOM when the threshold under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, or the Prior Notification Rules, issued by the State Council in August 2008 is triggered. If such prior notification is not obtained, MOFCOM may order the concentration to cease its operations, dispose of shares or assets, transfer the business of the concentration within a time limit, take any other necessary measures to restore the situation as it was before the concentration, and may impose administrative fines.\nIn addition, the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on the Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in August 2011, specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors involved in \u201can industry related to national security\u201d are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and prohibit any activities attempting to bypass such security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the abovementioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions.\nWe cannot preclude the possibility that the MOFCOM or other government agencies may publish explanations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of such security reviews in the future, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with target entities, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited. Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand our market share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected.\nWe and our shareholders face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises, assets attributed to a PRC establishment of a non-PRC company or immovable properties located in China owned by non-PRC companies.\nIn February 2015, SAT issued a Public Notice Regarding Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-Tax Resident Enterprises, or SAT Public Notice 7. SAT Public Notice 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets through offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, SAT Public Notice 7 provides clear criteria for assessment of reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT Public Notice 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets. In October 2017, SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017. The Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an indirect transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer other than transfer of shares of our common stock acquired and sold on public markets may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the taxes.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions that involve PRC taxable assets, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is the transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is the transferee in such transactions, under SAT Public Notice 7 or Bulletin 37, or both.\nRisks Related to Shares of our Common Stock\nThe relative lack of U.S. public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur management team lacks U.S. public company experience and is generally unfamiliar with the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The individuals who now constitute our senior management team have never had responsibility for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with all applicable requirements could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and distract our management from attending to the growth of our business.\nOur common stock is not listed on any stock exchange and there is a limited market for shares of our common stock. Even if a market for our common stock develops, our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations.\nOur common stock is not listed on any stock exchange. Although our Class A common stock is quoted on the OTC Marketplace, there is a limited public market for shares of our Class A common stock, and limited trades of our Class A common stock have taken place on the OTC Marketplace. Even if the shares of our common stock may in the future trade greater volume on the OTC Marketplace, the liquidity and price of our common stock is expected to be more limited than if such securities were quoted or listed on a national exchange. No assurances can be given that an active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Trading volume may be limited by the fact that many major institutional investment funds, including mutual funds, as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in over the counter stocks and certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending over the counter stocks because they are considered speculative, volatile and thinly traded. Lack of liquidity will limit the price at which stockholders may be able to sell our common stock.\nEven if our common stock will in the future trade more actively on the OTC Marketplace, the price of such common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations, in response to quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements by us or others, developments affecting us, and other events or factors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies, and may adversely affect the market prices of the securities. Such risks could have an adverse effect on the stock\u2019s future liquidity.\nBecause we became public by means of a \u201creverse merger,\u201d we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firm or investors in general.\nAdditional risks may exist because we became a public company through a \u201creverse merger.\u201d Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our company in the future. In addition, the SEC has recently issued an investor bulletin warning to investors about the risks of investing in companies that enter the U.S. capital markets through a \u201creverse merger.\u201d The release of such information from the SEC may have the effect of reducing investor interest in companies, such as us, that enter the U.S. capital markets through a \u201creverse merger.\u201d\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock will become eligible for listing or quotation on any exchange and the failure to do so may adversely affect your ability to dispose of our common stock in a timely fashion.\nIn order for our common stock to become eligible for listing or quotation on any exchange, reverse merger companies must have had their securities traded on an over-the-counter market for at least one year, maintained a certain minimum closing price for not less than 30 of the most recent 60 days prior to the filing of an initial listing application and prior to listing, and timely filed with the SEC all required reports since consummation of the reverse merger, including one annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for a full fiscal year commencing after the date of filing of the Current Report on Form 8-K which discloses the reverse merger. We may not be able to meet all of the filing requirements above and may not be able to satisfy the initial standards for listing or quotation on any exchange in the foreseeable future or at all. Even if we are able to become listed or quoted on an exchange, we may not be able to maintain a listing of the common stock on such stock exchange.\nOur common stock may be subject to penny stock rules, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock.\nBroker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a purchase or sale of a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver to the customer a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends.\nWe presently do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on any of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). We presently intend to retain all earnings, if any, to implement our business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe may need additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities, including our Class B common stock, could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe expect our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements through the third quarter of 2021, and we current plan to raise additional capital in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, we require additional capital for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we will seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. In addition, you may experience further dilution to the extent that shares of our Class B common stock are issued and sold to raise capital. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have authorized 3,750,000 shares of Class B common stock, at a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 4,447 shares of Class B common stock were issued and outstanding. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur dual-class voting structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class A common stock may view as beneficial.\nOur authorized common stock is divided into Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B common stock are entitled to five votes per share. Each share of Class B is convertible into one share of Class A common stock upon notice of the holder, while Class A common stock is not convertible into Class B common stock under any circumstances. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have authorized (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, of which 118,177,885 shares were issued and outstanding, and (ii) 3,750,000 shares of Class B common stock, of which 4,447 shares were issued and outstanding. Currently, the holder of Class A common stock will have the ability to control matters requiring shareholders\u2019 approval, including any amendment of our memorandum and articles of association. However, any future issuances of Class B common stock may be dilutive to the voting power of holders of Class A common stock. Any conversions of Class B common stock into Class A common stock may dilute the percentage ownership of the existing holders of Class A common stock within their class of ordinary shares.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nCertain of our executive officers, directors and large stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates owned approximately 80.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, our directors and executive officers have significant influence over our affairs due to their substantial ownership coupled with their positions on our management team and have substantial voting power to approve matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that some of our stockholders may believe is in their best interest.\nWe have a substantial number of authorized common shares available for future issuance that could cause dilution of our stockholders\u2019 interest and adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock.\nWe have a total of 1,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 3,750,000 shares of Class B common stock authorized for issuance and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with the rights, preferences and privileges that our Board may determine from time to time. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had 118,177,885 shares of issued and outstanding Class A common stock, 4,447 shares of issued and outstanding Class B common stock, and no outstanding preferred stock. We may seek financing that could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock. We may also make acquisitions that result in issuances of additional shares of our capital stock. Those additional issuances of capital stock would result in a significant reduction of your percentage interest in us. The addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or by the registration of any of our other securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe commercial success of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products depends upon the degree of their market acceptance among the medical community. If Yubo Beijing\u2019s products do not attain market acceptance among the medical community, its operations and profitability would be adversely affected.\nThe commercial success of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products depends, in large part, upon the degree of market acceptance they achieve among the medical community, particularly among physicians, pharmacists, administrators of hospitals, clinics and other health care institutions. Physicians may not prescribe or recommend Yubo Beijing\u2019s products to patients and pharmacies, procurement departments of hospitals, clinics and other health care institutions may not purchase Yubo Beijing\u2019s products if physicians or pharmacists do not find Yubo Beijing\u2019s products attractive. The acceptance and use of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products among the medical community will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u00b7\nperceptions by physicians, pharmacists, patients and others in the medical community about the safety and effectiveness of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7\npharmacological benefit of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products relative to competing products and products under development;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and potential advantages relative to competing products and products under development;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of Yubo Beijing\u2019s education, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u00b7\npublicity concerning Yubo Beijing\u2019s products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u00b7\nthe price for Yubo Beijing\u2019s products and competing products.\nIf Yubo Beijing\u2019s products fail to attain market acceptance among the medical community, or if Yubo Beijing\u2019s currently marketed products cannot maintain market acceptance, its results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future, which could negatively impact the trading value of our common stock. We may continue to incur operating losses in future periods. These losses may increase and we may never achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future for a variety of reasons, including increased competition, decreased growth in the automotive industry and other factors described elsewhere in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nFurther, we may incur significant losses in the future due to unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment.\nThese circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as described in Note 3: Going Concern to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, investors will likely lose all of their investment in our company. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nYubo Beijing\u2019s proprietary, next-generation stem cell derived technologies, approach for stem cell storage facilities and manufacturing platform for its stem cell based products, represent emerging approaches to medical treatments that face significant challenges and hurdles.\nYubo Beijing currently has two commercialized products: respiratory atomization products and cell basidiomycetes compound drink. Yubo Beijing plans to market and commercialize its other planned light application products soon. Because stem cell-based healthcare products and therapies represent a relatively new field of, developing and commercializing Yubo Beijing\u2019s products subjects us to a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval for Yubo Beijing\u2019s products, as the regulatory authorities may have limited experience with stem cell based healthcare products and therapies;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a customer\u2019s stem cells ex vivo and infusing the engineered stem cells back into the patient;\n\u00b7\nsourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies of the materials used to manufacture Yubo Beijing\u2019s product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping programming modules with the desired properties, while avoiding adverse reactions;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping a reliable and consistent vector and cell manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nestablishing manufacturing capacity suitable for the manufacture of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping protocols for the safe administration of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products;\n\u00b7\neducating medical personnel regarding Yubo Beijing\u2019s stem cell technologies and the potential side effect profile of Yubo Beijing\u2019s products;\n\u00b7\nestablishing sales and marketing capabilities to successfully launch and commercialize Yubo Beijing\u2019s product candidates if and when Yubo Beijing obtains any required regulatory approvals, and risks associated with gaining market acceptance of a novel therapy if Yubo Beijing receives approval; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for Yubo Beijing\u2019s novel and personalized therapies in connection with commercialization of any approved products.\nYubo Beijing may not be able to successfully develop its stem cell derived products, its technology or its other products in a manner that will yield products that are safe, effective, scalable or profitable.\nYubo Beijing may not be able to successfully create its own manufacturing infrastructure and stem cell storage facilities for supply and maintenance of its requirements of programmed stem cell products for use in clinical trials and for commercial sale.\nYubo Beijing currently has manufacturing and storage facilities in China supplying clinical materials for its trials and commercial production through agreements with third parties. Yubo Beijing intends to expand the capacities at these sites as it begins to expand the production of its products. Yubo Beijing is also in the process of establishing manufacturing capability in Beijing, which will provide a regional product supply as well as add to its global manufacturing ability.\nYubo Beijing\u2019s manufacturing and commercialization strategy is based on establishing a fully integrated vein-to-vein product delivery cycle. Over time, Yubo Beijing expects to establish regional or zonal manufacturing hubs to service major markets to meet projected needs for commercial sale quantities. However, Yubo Beijing is still in the process of constructing manufacturing and storage facilities that will allow it to meet commercial sale quantities.\nThe implementation of this plan is subject to many risks. For example, the establishment of a stem cell-therapy manufacturing facility is a complex endeavor requiring knowledgeable individuals. Expanding Yubo Beijing\u2019s internal manufacturing infrastructure will rely upon finding personnel with an appropriate background and training to staff and operate the facility. Should Yubo Beijing be unable to find these individuals, it may need to rely on external contractors or train additional personnel to fill the needed roles. There are a small number of individuals with experience in stem cell therapy and the competition for these individuals is high.\nYubo Beijing expects that operating its own commercial stem cell manufacturing and storage facilities will provide it with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and allow for better long-term cost margins. However, Yubo Beijing has limited experience as a company in designing and operating a commercial manufacturing and storage facility and may never be successful in developing its own manufacturing capability. Yubo Beijing may establish additional manufacturing and storage sites as it expands its commercial footprint to multiple geographies, which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly. Even if Yubo Beijing is successful, Yubo Beijing\u2019s operations could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors, or Yubo Beijing may not be successful in establishing sufficient capacity to produce its product candidates in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch or to meet potential future demand, all of which could prevent Yubo Beijing from realizing the intended benefits of its manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on its business.\nYubo Beijing may not be able to timely identify or otherwise effectively respond to changing customer preferences, and Yubo Beijing may fail to optimize its product offering and inventory position.\nThe medical industry in China is rapidly evolving and is subject to rapidly changing customer preferences that are difficult to predict. Yubo Beijing believes that its success depends on its ability to anticipate and identify customer preferences and adapt its product selection to these preferences. In particular, Yubo Beijing believes that it must optimize its product selection and inventory positions based on sales trends. No assurances can be given that Yubo Beijing\u2019s product selection, especially its selections of nutritional supplements and food products, will accurately reflect customer preferences at any given time. If Yubo Beijing fails to anticipate accurately either the market for its products or customers\u2019 purchasing habits or fail to respond to customers\u2019 changing preferences promptly and effectively, Yubo Beijing may not be able to adapt its product selection to customer preferences or make appropriate adjustments to its inventory positions, which could significantly reduce its revenue and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nYubo Beijing faces significant competition, and if Yubo Beijing does not compete successfully against existing and new competitors, Yubo Beijing\u2019s revenue and profitability would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe medical industry in China is highly competitive, and Yubo Beijing expects competition to intensify. In addition, there is a trend towards consolidation of the medical industry in the future. Yubo Beijing\u2019s primary competitors are other medical distributors. Yubo Beijing competes for customers and revenue primarily on the basis of product selection, price, and timely delivery of products. Moreover, Yubo Beijing may be subject to additional competition from new entrants to the medical industry in China. If the PRC government removes the barriers for foreign companies to operate majority-owned medical distributors in China, Yubo Beijing could face increased competition from foreign companies. Some of Yubo Beijing\u2019s larger competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as:\n\u00b7\ngreater financial and other resources;\n\u00b7\nlarger variety of products;\n\u00b7\nmore extensive and advanced supply chain management systems;\n\u00b7\ngreater pricing flexibility;\n\u00b7\nlarger economies of scale and purchasing power;\n\u00b7\nmore extensive advertising and marketing efforts;\n\u00b7\ngreater knowledge of local market conditions;\n\u00b7\nlarger sales and distribution networks.\nAs a result, Yubo Beijing may be unable to offer products similar to, or more desirable than, those offered by its competitors, market its products as effectively as its competitors or otherwise respond successfully to competitive pressures. In addition, Yubo Beijing\u2019s competitors may be able to offer larger discounts on the same or competing products, and Yubo Beijing may not be able to profitably match those discounts. Furthermore, Yubo Beijing\u2019s competitors may offer products that are more attractive to Yubo Beijing\u2019s customers or that render Yubo Beijing\u2019s products uncompetitive. Yubo Beijing\u2019s failure to compete successfully could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nYubo Beijing relies on third-party manufacturers to supply all of its light application products.\nYubo Beijing relies on third-party manufactures to supply all of its light application products. Reliance on such third-party manufacturers involves a number of risks, including a lack of control over the manufacturing process and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate capacity. If any of the third-party manufacturers cannot or will not manufacture Yubo Beijing\u2019s products in required volumes in compliance with applicable regulations, on a cost-effective basis, in a timely manner, or at all, Yubo Beijing will have to secure alternative manufacturers. Maintaining relationships with existing manufacturers and replacing such manufacturers may be difficult and time consuming. Any disruption of Yubo Beijing\u2019s network of manufacturers, including failure to renew existing distribution agreements with desired manufacturers, could negatively affect Yubo Beijing\u2019s product selection and Yubo Beijing\u2019s ability to effectively sell its products and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nYubo Beijing\u2019s certificates, permits, and licenses related to its business are subject to governmental control and renewal and failure to obtain renewal will cause all or part of its operations to be terminated.\nYubo Beijing is subject to various PRC laws and regulations pertaining to the medical industry. Although Yubo Beijing does not currently own any licenses or permits for the production of its light application products, Yubo Beijing is permitted under the PRC law to rely on the certificates, permits, and licenses that belong to and are maintained by its third-party manufacturers to market and sell its light application products. We are also in the process of applying for a product license for one of our subsidiaries located in Chengdu, China. In the event that Yubo Beijing or its third-party manufacturers, are not able to meet any new requirements imposed on Yubo Beijing\u2019s business by the appropriate regulatory authorities or are unable to renew its certificates, permits and licenses, all or part of Yubo Beijing operations may be terminated. Furthermore, if escalating compliance costs associated with governmental standards and regulations restrict or prohibit any part of Yubo Beijing\u2019s operations, it may adversely affect Yubo Beijing\u2019s operation and profitability.\nIf Yubo Beijing is unable to protect its intellectual property from infringement, Yubo Beijing\u2019s business and prospects may be harmed.\nAs sales of Yubo Beijing\u2019s private label products increasingly account for a substantial portion of its revenue, Yubo Beijing considers its brand name, trade names and trademarks to be valuable assets. Under PRC law, Yubo Beijing has the exclusive right to use a trademark for products for which such trademark has been registered with the PRC Trademark Office of State Administration for Industry and Commerce (\u201cSAIC\u201d). In addition, no assurances can be given that Yubo Beijing will be able to obtain any trademarks for which it may apply in the future.\nMoreover, Yubo Beijing may be unable to prevent third parties from using its brand name or trademarks without authorization and Yubo Beijing may not have adequate remedies for such violations. Unauthorized use of Yubo Beijing\u2019s brand name or trademarks by third parties may adversely affect its business and reputation, including the perceived quality and reliability of its products.\nYubo Beijing currently owns one invention patent in the PRC, and Yubo Beijing relies on trade secrets to protect its know-how and other proprietary information, including pricing, purchasing, promotional strategies, customer lists and/or suppliers lists. However, it is often difficult to register, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights in the PRC. Confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to Yubo Beijing for any such breach. Accordingly, Yubo Beijing may not be able to effectively protect its intellectual property rights in the PRC. Policing any unauthorized use of Yubo Beijing\u2019s intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps Yubo Beijing takes may be inadequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of its intellectual property. In the event that Yubo Beijing resorts to litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of its managerial and financial resources, and could put its intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or narrowed in scope. Yubo Beijing can provide no assurance that it will prevail in such litigation, and even if it does prevail, Yubo Beijing may not obtain a meaningful recovery. In addition, Yubo Beijing\u2019s trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, its competitors. Any failure in maintaining, protecting or enforcing Yubo Beijing\u2019s intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While Yubo Beijing uses reasonable efforts to protect its trade secrets, its employees, consultants, contractors or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose its information to competitors. In addition, confidentiality agreements, if any, executed by the foregoing persons may not be enforceable or provide meaningful protection for Yubo Beijing\u2019s trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. If Yubo Beijing were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using its trade secrets, its enforcement efforts could be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, if Yubo Beijing\u2019s competitors independently develop information that is equivalent to its trade secrets or other proprietary information, it will be even more difficult for Yubo Beijing to enforce its rights and Yubo Beijing\u2019s business and prospects could be harmed. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce Yubo Beijing\u2019s intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. However, because the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in the PRC are uncertain and still evolving, Yubo Beijing may not be successful in prosecuting these cases. In addition, any litigation or proceeding or other efforts to protect Yubo Beijing\u2019s intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of its resources and could seriously harm its business and operating results. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of Yubo Beijing\u2019s proprietary rights is uncertain and may not adequately protect its rights or permit Yubo Beijing to gain or keep its competitive advantage. If Yubo Beijing is unable to protect its trade names, trademarks, trade secrets and other propriety information from infringement, Yubo Beijing\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nYubo Beijing may acquire other businesses, license rights to products or form alliances with third-parties, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect its profitability.\nYubo Beijing may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, as part of its business strategy. Yubo Beijing may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Yubo Beijing is successful in making an acquisition, the products that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Yubo Beijing may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. This may result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\nOur executive officers and directors have existing responsibilities and, in the future, may have additional responsibilities, to provide management and services to other entities in addition to us. As a result, conflicts of interest between us and the other activities of those persons may occur from time to time and could have an adverse effect on us.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors have existing responsibilities and, in the future, may have additional responsibilities, to provide management and services to other entities in addition to us. As a result, conflicts of interest between us and the other activities of those persons may occur from time to time, including that:\n\u00b7\nwe may enter into contracts between us, on the one hand, and other entities for which our executive directors or officers hold positions, on the other, that are not the result of arm\u2019s-length transactions;\n\u00b7\nour executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with other entities may be aware of certain business opportunities that are appropriate for presentation to us as well as to such other entities and may present such business opportunities to such other entities; and\n\u00b7\nour executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with other entities may have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, other entities and may have conflicts of interest in allocating time.\nWe will attempt to resolve any such conflicts of interest in our favor. Our officers and directors are accountable to us and our shareholders as fiduciaries, which requires that such officers and directors exercise good faith and integrity in handling our affairs. Nevertheless, such conflicts could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests or the economic interests of certain related parties above ours. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. It is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to the reporting obligation and internal control requirements of federal securities laws, which is expensive and time-consuming.\nWe are a public reporting company in the United States and, accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders causes our expenses to be higher than they would be if we remained a privately-held company.\nWe are a reporting company with the SEC and therefore must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls. It is time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In order to expand our operations, we will need to hire additional financial reporting, internal control, and other finance staff in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are subject to critical accounting policies and actual results may vary from our estimates.\nWe follow generally accepted accounting principles in the United States in preparing our financial statements. As part of the preparation of such financial reports, we must make many estimates and judgments concerning future events, which affect the value of the assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements. We believe that these estimates and judgments are reasonable, and we make them in accordance with our accounting policies based on information available at the time. However, actual results could differ from our estimates, and this could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues that could be material to our financial position and results of operations in the future.\nWe may need additional capital and may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position; the issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to our shareholders.\nWe may need to raise additional capital if our expenditures exceed our current expectations due to changed business conditions or other future developments. Our future liquidity needs and other business reasons may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities or securities convertible or exchangeable to our equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that restrict our operational flexibility. Our ability to raise additional funds in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\nour future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions for capital-raising activities by medical companies; and\n\u00b7\neconomic, political and other conditions in China and elsewhere.\nNo assurances can be given that we will be able to obtain additional capital in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms or at all.", "PERMNO": 78983, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "MAGAA"}
