{"cik": "1412665", "company": "MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nInterest rates and other conditions impact our results of operations.\nOur profitability is in large part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Like most banking institutions, our net interest spread and margin is affected by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in such rates. At any given time, our assets and liabilities will be such that they are affected differently by a given change in interest rates. As a result, an increase or decrease in rates, the length of loan terms or the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans in our portfolio could have a positive or negative effect on our net income, capital and liquidity. The competition for loans in the marketplace and the overall interest rate environment has kept interest rates on loans low. Interest rates paid on deposit products have declined steadily in recent years, but further significant decline is unlikely as interest rates on deposits have approached zero. We expect to continue battling net interest margin compression in 2015, with interest rates at generational lows.\nWe measure interest rate risk under various rate scenarios and using specific criteria and assumptions. A summary of this process, along with the results of our net interest income simulations, is presented at \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d included under Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nRising interest rates will likely result in a decline in value of our fixed-rate debt securities. The unrealized losses resulting from holding these securities would be recognized in other comprehensive income (or net income, if the decline is other-than-temporary), and reduce total shareholders\u2019 equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios; however, tangible common equity and the associated ratios used by many investors would be reduced. If debt securities in an unrealized loss position are sold, such losses become realized and will reduce our regulatory capital ratios.\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the Iowa City and Oskaloosa markets and other markets in eastern and central Iowa.\nAlthough our markets will expand into parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Florida if the merger with Central is completed, we operate primarily in the Iowa City and Oskaloosa, Iowa, markets and their surrounding communities in eastern and central Iowa. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the economic conditions in those areas. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our customers\u2019 business and financial interests may extend well beyond these market areas, adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets. Although, in general, the Iowa economy and real estate market were not affected as severely as some other areas of the United States in recent years, they are not immune to challenging economic conditions that affect the United States and world economies.\nAdverse weather affecting the markets we serve could hurt our business and prospects for growth.\nSubstantially all of our business is conducted in the State of Iowa, and a significant portion is conducted in rural communities. The Iowa economy, in general, is heavily dependent on agriculture and therefore the overall Iowa economy, and particularly the economies of the rural communities that we serve, can be greatly affected by severe weather conditions, including droughts, storms, tornadoes and flooding. Unfavorable weather conditions may decrease agricultural productivity or could result in damage to our branch locations or the property of our customers, all of which could adversely affect the local economy. An adverse affect on the economy of Iowa would negatively affect our profitability.\nWe must manage our credit risk effectively.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. We attempt to minimize our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department. However, we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks.\nIf the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, fails to continue to improve, or even if it does, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consists of commercial loans, and we focus on lending to small to medium-sized businesses. The size of the loans we can offer to commercial customers is less than the size of the loans that our competitors with larger lending limits can offer. This may limit our ability to establish relationships with the area\u2019s largest businesses. As a result, we may assume greater lending risks than financial institutions that have a lesser concentration of such loans and tend to make loans to larger businesses. Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. However, depending on the overall financial condition of the borrower, some loans are made on an unsecured basis. In addition to commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, MidWestOne Bank is also active in residential mortgage and consumer lending. Should the economic climate worsen, or even if it does not, our borrowers may experience financial difficulties, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise, which could negatively impact our business.\nCommercial, industrial and agricultural loans make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\nCommercial, industrial and agricultural loans (including credit cards and commercially related overdrafts), were $409.7 million, or approximately 36.2% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2014. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation value of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing these loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the\nsuccess of the business. In addition, if the U.S. economy fails to continue to improve, this could harm the businesses of our commercial and industrial customers and reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nPayments on agricultural loans are dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products (both domestically and internationally) and the impact of government regulations (including changes in price supports, subsidies and environmental regulations). In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary crops in our market areas are corn and soybeans. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these crops could have an adverse effect on our agricultural real estate loan portfolio. Likewise, agricultural operating loans involve a greater degree of risk than lending on residential properties, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment or assets such as livestock or crops. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.\nOur loan portfolio has a significant concentration of commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value.\nCommercial real estate lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Specifically, commercial real estate loans were $426.5 million, or approximately 37.6% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2014. Of this amount, $115.0 million, or approximately 10.2% of our total loan portfolio, are loans secured by owner-occupied property. The market value of real estate securing our commercial real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Although a significant portion of such loans is secured by real estate as a secondary form of repayment, adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nIf problems develop in the commercial real estate market, particularly within one or more of our markets, the value of collateral securing our commercial real estate loans could decline. In such case, we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and/or capital. We generally have not experienced a downturn in credit performance by our commercial real estate loan customers in recent years, but, in light of the continued general uncertainty that exists in the economy and credit markets nationally, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience any deterioration in such performance.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe established our allowance for loan losses in consultation with the credit officers of MidWestOne Bank and maintain it at a level considered appropriate by management to absorb probable loan losses that are inherent in the portfolio. The amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates and the value of the underlying collateral, which are beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. At December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans was 1.44% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was approximately 125.7%. Although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb probable loan losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future. Loan losses in excess of our reserves may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings) totaled $13.0 million, or 1.15% of our loan portfolio, and our nonperforming assets (which include nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned) totaled $14.9 million, or 1.32% of loans. In addition, we had $4.7 million in accruing loans that were 31-89 days delinquent as of December 31, 2014.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity, increasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\nWe may desire or be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We intend to grow our business organically and to explore opportunities to grow our business by taking advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities, and such growth plans may require us to raise additional capital to ensure that we have adequate levels of capital to support such growth on top of our current operations. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our growth plans and in this regard, in early 2013, we renewed our universal shelf-registration statement registering for future sale up to $25 million of securities that places us in a position to raise capital if the need were to arise or if an attractive opportunity were presented. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed or desired, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment maturities and sales, deposits and funds from sales of capital securities. Additional liquidity is provided by brokered deposits, bank lines of credit, repurchase agreements and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and by historically depressed levels of liquidity. As demonstrated by the recent financial crisis, under such circumstances, the liquidity issues are often particularly acute for regional and community banks, as larger financial institutions may curtail their lending to regional and community banks to reduce their exposure to the risks of other banks. Correspondent lenders may also reduce or even eliminate federal funds lines for their correspondent customers in difficult economic times. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage.\nAs a result, we rely more on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our stockholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations to which we are subject, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nThe Company and MidWestOne Bank are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory agencies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide, as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nEconomic conditions since 2008, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. This environment has subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new legislative and regulatory proposals, and modifications of existing regulations, continue to be introduced that could further increase the oversight of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures. If these regulatory trends continue, they could adversely affect our business and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on business demand deposits could increase our interest expense.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on these demand deposits to compete for customers. Although this development has not meaningfully impacted our interest expense in the current low-rate, high-liquidity environment in which competition among financial institutions for deposits is generally low, competitive pressures in the future require us to pay interest on these demand deposits to attract and retain business customers, in which case our interest expense would increase and our net interest margin would decrease. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $526.2 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nAlthough it has shown signs of improvement over the last two years, since late 2007, the U.S. economy has generally experienced challenging economic conditions. Business activity across a range of industries and regions remains reduced from historical levels under more favorable economic conditions. Likewise, many local governments have been experiencing certain difficulties, including lower tax revenues, which have impacted their ability to cover costs. Unemployment also generally remains at elevated levels. Under such conditions, the financial services industry has historically been affected by declines in the values of various significant asset classes, reduced levels of liquidity and the lack of opportunities to originate new loans. While these challenges are generally less severe today than during certain periods in the recent past, we continue to feel their impact, particularly with respect to loan originations.\nAs a result of these economic conditions, in recent years many lending institutions, including the Bank, have experienced declines in the performance of their loans, including commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans and consumer loans, from pre-2007 norms. Moreover, competition among depository institutions, particularly for quality loans, has increased significantly. There have been significant new laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, with a potential for further regulation in the future, and bank regulatory agencies in general have been very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including through formal or informal enforcement actions or orders. The impact of new legislation in response to these developments may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price.\nIn addition, if the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, fails to continue to improve, this may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. A worsening of these conditions likely would exacerbate the adverse effects on us and others in the financial services industry noted above.\nWe have investments in pools of performing and nonperforming loans that generate interest income with yields that may fluctuate considerably.\nAlthough we decided to exit our loan pool participation line of business in 2010, we continue to hold investments in certain loan pools until their balances pay down. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 1% of our earning assets were invested in loan pool participations, and approximately 2% of our gross total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was derived from the loan pool participations. These loan pool participations represent a mixture of performing, subperforming and nonperforming loans and other real estate owned. As of December 31, 2014, our loan pool investment of $21.5 million consisted of loans secured by commercial real estate (66.4%), commercial operating (4.4%), single-family residential real estate (15.6%), and other loans (13.6%). The loan pool investment is a \u201cnontraditional\u201d activity that has, historically, provided us and our predecessor entities with a higher return than typical loans and investment securities, albeit with a higher level of risk as well. The return on investment in loan pool participations and the effect on profitability can be unpredictable due to fluctuations in the balance of loan pool participations and collections from borrowers by the loan pool servicer. Loan pool balances can be affected by the payment and refinancing activities of the borrowers resulting in pay-offs of the underlying loans and reduction in the balances. Collections from the individual borrowers are managed by the loan pool servicer and are affected by the borrower\u2019s financial ability and willingness to pay, foreclosure and legal action, collateral value, and the economy in general. Any of these identified factors, and others not identified, could affect our return on loan pool investments.\nAlthough we did not seek to purchase consumer or consumer real estate loans characterized as subprime or Alt-A credits, because the purchases of these assets were on a pool basis, we have acquired some subprime loans which have borrowers or guarantors having FICO scores below 640. Consumer-based paper makes up approximately 9.8% of our loan pool investment and, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 1.1% of the basis amount of our loan pool investment represented subprime credit. Because we do not originate the consumer-based loans that may be characterized as Alt-A, and because of the nature of the information provided to us with respect to any Alt-A loans in the loan pool participations, we are not able to verify the basis amount of our loan pool investment that represents Alt-A credit. Loans that are characterized as subprime and, to a lesser extent, Alt-A carry a higher risk of default by the underlying borrowers than other types of loans, which could affect the value of the overall loan pool investment.\nDowngrades in the credit rating of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancement for our state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for, and valuation of, these types of securities.\nWe invest in tax-exempt and taxable state and local municipal securities, some of which are insured by monoline insurers. As of December 31, 2014, we had $234.9 million of municipal securities, which represented 44.6% of our total securities portfolio. Following the onset of the financial crisis in recent years, several of these insurers came under scrutiny by rating agencies. Even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer, the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of our investment securities. Such a downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent legislative and regulatory reforms applicable to the financial services industry may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws, regulations, rules, policies and regulatory interpretations governing us are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time as Congress and various regulatory agencies react to adverse economic conditions or other matters. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 served as a catalyst for a number of significant changes in the financial services industry, including\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which will increase both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, together with the regulations developed and to be developed thereunder, affects large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that impact how community banks, thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will operate in the future. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act changes the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than its deposit base, permanently raises the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000, and expands the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise the premiums we pay for deposit insurance. The legislation allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, contains provisions on mortgage-related matters (such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties) and establishes the CFPB as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve. This entity has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly traded companies.\nIn addition, in July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III Rule. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements as well as to bank and saving and loan holding companies, other than \u201csmall bank holding companies\u201d (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion). The Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period through 2019 for many of the new rules.\nThe Basel III Rule not only increases most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, it introduces a new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The Basel III Rule also expands the current definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (i.e., Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that now generally qualify as Tier 1 Capital will not qualify or their qualifications will change when the Basel III Rule is fully implemented. However, the Basel III Rule permits banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Basel III Rule has maintained the general structure of the current prompt corrective action thresholds while incorporating the increased requirements, including the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. In order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.5% or more, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8% or more, a Total Capital ratio of 10% or more, and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.\nThese provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, will impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management has reviewed the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Rule, and has determined that our institution is in compliance with the new rules. However, the ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general, and us in particular, will not be know for some time.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to certain limitations and restrictions, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue paying the same level of dividends in the future that we have paid in the past or that we will be able to pay future dividends at all.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of MidWestOne Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to MidWestOne Bank, including the requirement under the Iowa Banking Act that it may not pay dividends in excess of its accumulated net profits. If these regulatory requirements are not met, MidWestOne Bank will not be able to pay dividends to us, and we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) in light of our earnings, capital adequacy and financial condition. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve indicates\nthat the board of directors of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the Company\u2019s dividends if:\n\u2022\nthe company\u2019s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u2022\nthe prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u2022\nthe company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $15.5 million of junior subordinated debentures held by a statutory business trust that we control. Interest payments on the debentures, which totaled $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. We have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if we elect to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock.\nOur ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings.\nMuch of our success and growth has been influenced by our ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas. Our ability to retain our executive officers, current management teams, branch managers and loan officers will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical, as we grow, to be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our community-based operating strategy. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives. These rules, when adopted, may make it more difficult to attract and retain the people we need to operate our businesses and limit our ability to promote our objectives through our compensation and incentive programs. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition in all phases of our business from banks and other financial institutions.\nThe banking and financial services businesses in our markets are highly competitive. Our competitors include large regional banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, small local credit unions as well as large aggressive and expansion-minded credit unions, and other nonbank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a competitive alternative to traditional banking services.\nIncreased competition in our markets may result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits, reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted. If increased competition causes us to modify our underwriting standards, we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities. Additionally, many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, have larger lending limits and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enabling us to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and the potential for cost reduction. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow our market share. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we cannot provide you with assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security and cyber-attacks, all if which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company relies heavily on internal and outsourced technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. As the Company\u2019s reliance on technology has increased, so have the potential risks of a technology-related operation interruption (such as disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems) or the occurrence of a cyber-attacks (such as unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s systems). These risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. The Company is not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. However, applying guidance from FFIEC, the Company has analyzed and will continue to analyze security related to device specific considerations, user access topics, transaction-processing and network integrity.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company\u2019s reputation could be affected, would could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines.\nOur financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given recent economic conditions, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compensation risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. Our ability to successfully identify and manage risks facing us is an important factor that can significantly impact our results. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, financial condition or results of operations from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nWe have counterparty risk and therefore we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are generally interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, credit or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and regularly engage in transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions may expose us to credit or other risks if another financial institution experiences adverse circumstances. In certain circumstances, the collateral that we hold may be insufficient to fully cover the risk that a counterparty defaults on its obligations, which may cause us to experience losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common shares, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nAlthough our common shares are listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading in our common shares has substantially less liquidity than many other companies listed on NASDAQ. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future.\nCertain shareholders own a significant interest in the company and may exercise their control in a manner detrimental to your interests.\nCertain MidWestOne shareholders who are descendants of our founder collectively control approximately 33.6% of our outstanding common stock and may have the opportunity to exert influence on the outcome of matters required to be submitted to shareholders for approval. In addition, this significant level of ownership by members of the founding family may contribute to the rather limited liquidity of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As discussed below, if the merger with Central is consummated, additional shares will be issued to Central\u2019s shareholders. However, the ownership of our common stock will still be concentrated among a small group of shareholders who continue to exert a significant influence over the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Merger With Central\nIf the merger with Central is completed, difficulties in combining the operations of Central and the Company may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from the merger.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve fully the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies it hopes to achieve in the merger. The success of the merger will depend on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nintegrate the operations of Central and the Company, including successfully integrating and combining the technology, financial, credit, security and legal reporting systems and controls of the Company and Central;\n\u2022\nmaintain existing relationships with depositors so as to minimize withdrawals of deposits after the merger;\n\u2022\nmaintain and enhance existing relationships with borrowers so as to limit unanticipated losses from loans of Central\u2019s banking subsidiary and the Bank;\n\u2022\ncontrol the incremental non-interest expense so as to maintain overall operating efficiencies; and\n\u2022\ncompete effectively in the communities served by Central and the Company.\nIf the merger is not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nThe Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with Central, as well as the costs and expenses of filing certain required documents with the SEC in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.", "PERMNO": 92593, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MOFG"}
