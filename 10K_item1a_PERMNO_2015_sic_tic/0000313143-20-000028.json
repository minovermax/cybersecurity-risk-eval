{"cik": "313143", "company": "HAEMONETICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" at the end of Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or outbreaks of communicable diseases, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, which may be heightened if the pandemic and various government responses to it continue for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world. If the pandemic continues and conditions worsen, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, those outlined below:\n\u2022\nProduct Demand. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and expect to experience more significantly in fiscal 2021, decreased demand for our products and increased volatility in demand for our products. For example, lower collection volumes at source plasma collection centers due to COVID-19 factors, including stay-at-home and other government orders designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, donor safety concerns, and reduced donor collection capacity due to shutdowns and social distancing requirements, have adversely affected and likely will continue to adversely affect demand for our Plasma disposable products. Additionally, reductions in elective surgeries and trauma cases, restrictions on vendor access at customer sites and the reallocation of hospital resources to address critical intensive care needs during the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect demand for our Hospital products, particularly our Cell Saver and TEG devices. We also have experienced, and may continue to experience, in certain markets rapid and unpredictable changes in demand for some of our Blood Center disposable products as blood collectors seek to replenish their blood product inventories and safety stocks. Such changes could impact our ability to meet demand on a timely basis or could result in potential reductions in demand in future periods if the supply of blood held by our customers significantly exceeds the demand for blood from hospitals due to declines of elective surgeries and trauma cases. Finally, we may experience delays in our clinical trials as a result of COVID-19 that may result in delays for new or expanded authorizations for our products, which could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans for our products.\n\u2022\nManufacturing, Supply Chain and Distribution System Disruption. COVID-19 and its associated economic disruptions could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing capacity, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking and financial difficulties experienced by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. Although we have not experienced significant manufacturing or supply chain difficulties to date as a result of COVID-19, we may in the future. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nPotential Liquidity and Credit Impacts. While we have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to committed credit lines, we may be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivables if our customers experience financial difficulties or are unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all, which in turn would adversely affect our financial condition. Moreover, conditions in the financial and credit markets could increase the cost of and our accessibility to capital. If we need to access capital, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all.\nThese and other impacts of COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the magnitude of the adverse impact of these factors on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be primarily driven by: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; the timing, scope and effectiveness of governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions; general confidence about personal health and safety; and the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on U.S. and international healthcare systems, the U.S. economy and the worldwide economy.\nIf our business strategy does not yield the expected results or we fail to implement the necessary changes to our operations, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe view our operations and manage our business in three principal reporting segments: Plasma, Blood Center and Hospital. We believe that Plasma and Hospital have growth potential, while Blood Center competes in challenging markets that require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts.\nIf we have not correctly identified the product categories with greatest growth potential, we will not allocate our resources appropriately which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if we are unable to reduce costs and complexity in our Blood Center business unit, we will obtain lower than expected cash flows to fund our future growth and capital needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nMaterial reductions in purchasing from or loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2020, our two largest Plasma customers each accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 54% of our net revenues. If any of our largest customers materially reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us for any reason, including material decreases in demand for plasma or development of alternative processes, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThree of our largest Plasma customers have contracts that are subject to renewal before the end of fiscal 2022. In the event that we do not extend our current contracts or enter into new contracts with these customers on acceptable terms, our revenues and operating income could be negatively impacted in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of operations.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\nIf we are unable to successfully convert customers to our NexSys platform, meet customer placement demands or negotiate competitive pricing, we may not realize the intended benefits of our investment.\nWe have focused heavily on the development and commercialization of our NexSys platform, comprised of both the NexSys PCS plasmapheresis system and NexLynk DMS software. Since the commercial launch of our NexSys platform in fiscal 2019, we have entered into long-term customer contracts providing for conversion to NexSys. However, if additional customers do not adopt NexSys or they do and we are unable to procure sufficient NexySys PCS devices from our contract manufacturers to meet demand or receive a price that provides an inadequate return on our investment, or if such customer adoption does not occur within the expected timeframe, we may not realize the full intended benefits of our investment.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems, including cloud-based computing, to process, transmit and store electronic information for our day-to-day operations and for our customers, including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information. Additionally, certain of our products collect data regarding patients and donors and connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes or are actively managed by Haemonetics on behalf of specific customers. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. We also outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties that, as a result of this outsourcing, could have access to certain confidential information and whose systems may also be vulnerable to these types of attacks or disruptions. Security threats, including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive and, like other large multi-national companies, we have experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. Accordingly, our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. Although prior cyber incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of personal information and proprietary or confidential information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cyber attacks, intrusions, breakdowns or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable securities and privacy laws, regulations, standard standards. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us or third parties we work with to maintain or protect our respective information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other healthcare professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data in the United States and in other countries, including, but not limited to, HIPAA, HITECH, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. HIPAA also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures. We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could results in material fines or litigation.\nWe outsource certain aspects of our business to a single third-party vendor that subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nCurrently, we rely on a single vendor to support several of our business processes, including customer service and support and elements of enterprise technology, procurement, accounting and human resources. We make diligent efforts to ensure that the provider of these outsourced services is observing proper internal control practices. However, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with the vendor\u2019s ability to successfully provide the necessary services to meet our needs.\nIf our vendor is unable to adequately protect our data or information is lost, if our ability to deliver our services is interrupted (including as a result of significant outbreaks of disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, strikes, terrorism attacks or other adverse events in the countries in which the vendor operates), if our vendor's fees are higher than expected, or if our vendor makes mistakes in the execution of operations support, then our business and operating results may be negatively affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue derives from the sale of blood collection supplies. Declines in the number of blood collection procedures have adversely impacted our business and future declines may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for whole blood disposable products in the U.S. continued to decrease in fiscal 2020 due to sustained declines in transfusion rates caused by hospitals' improved blood management techniques and protocols. In response to this trend, U.S. blood center collection groups prefer single source vendors for their whole blood collection products and are primarily focused on obtaining the lowest average selling prices. We expect to see continued declines in transfusion rates and the market to remain price-focused and highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Continued declines in this market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nConsolidation of healthcare providers and blood collectors has increased demand for price concessions and caused the exclusion of suppliers from significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and policy influences are causing the healthcare and blood collection industries to make substantial structural and financial changes that affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs are causing structural reforms in healthcare delivery, including the reduction in blood use and reduced payments for care. These trends have placed greater pricing pressure on suppliers and, in some cases, decreased average selling prices and increased the number of sole source relationships. This pressure impacts our Hospital and Blood Center businesses.\nThe influence of group purchasing organizations in the U.S., integrated delivery networks and large single accounts has the potential to put price pressure on our Hospital business. It also puts price pressure on our U.S. Blood Center customers who are also facing reduced demand for red cells. Our Blood Center customers have responded to this pressure by creating their own group purchasing organizations and resorting to single source tenders to create incentives for suppliers, including us, to significantly reduce prices.\nWe expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors. This may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, obtain key components or raw materials, or the failure of a sole source supplier may adversely affect our business.\nWe have a complex global supply chain that involves integrating key suppliers and our manufacturing capacity into a global movement of components and finished goods.\nWe manufacture certain key disposables at single locations with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in the closure of or damage to one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to supply the relevant products at previous levels or at all for some period. Additionally, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain finished goods, components and raw materials from sole suppliers, notably JMS Co. Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories, Leica Biosystems Melbourne Pty. Ltd., Sanmina Corporation and Sparton Medical Systems Colorado LLC, who have their own complex supply chains. Any disruption to one or more of our suppliers\u2019 production or delivery of sufficient volumes of components conforming to our specifications, could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver finished products to our customers. For example, we purchase components in Asia for use in manufacturing in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico. We source all of our apheresis equipment from Asia and regularly ship finished goods from the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico to the rest of the world.\nDue to the high standards and stringent requirements of the FDA and other similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies applicable to manufacturing our products, such as the FDA's Quality System Regulation and Good Manufacturing Practices, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain raw materials, components or finished goods. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials, components or finished goods on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, could compromise our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPlastics are the principal component of our disposables, which are the main source of our revenues. Any change in the price, composition or availability of the plastics or resins we purchase could adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to price, composition and availability of the plastic raw materials used in our business. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response thereto) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of petroleum or petroleum derivatives could have an adverse impact on the costs to procure plastic raw materials and the costs of our transportation/freight. Increases in the costs of other commodities also may affect our procurement costs to a lesser degree.\nThe composition of the plastic we purchase is also important. Today, we purchase plastics that contain phthalates, which are used to make plastic malleable. Should plastics with phthalates become unavailable due to regulatory changes, we may be required to obtain regulatory approvals from the FDA and foreign authorities for a number of products.\nWhile we have not experienced shortages in the past, any interruption in the supply for certain plastics could have a material impact on our business by limiting our ability to manufacture and sell the products that represent a significant portion of our revenues. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our product lines through internal research and development, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. New product development requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products and technologies, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products. In addition, patents attained by others could preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from our Operational Excellence Program.\nIn July 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new Operational Excellence Program, also referred to in this report as the 2020 Program, and delegated authority to management to determine the detail of the initiatives that will comprise the program. The 2020 Program is designed to improve operational performance and reduce cost principally in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. While cost savings from the 2020 Program to date have been consistent with our expectations, it is possible that events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur, including as a direct or indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. Our inability to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the 2020 Program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits.\nWe may seek to supplement our organic growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky and require significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. Promising partnerships and acquisitions may also not be completed for reasons such as competition among prospective partners or buyers, the inability to reach satisfactory terms, the need for regulatory approvals or the existence of economic conditions affecting our access to capital for acquisitions and other capital investments. If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframe.\nAs a medical device manufacturer we operate in a highly regulated industry, and non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory bodies. Our operations are also subject to continuous review and monitoring by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nFailure to substantially comply with applicable regulations could subject our products to recall or seizure by government authorities, or an order to suspend manufacturing activities. If our products were determined to have design or manufacturing flaws, this could result in their recall or seizure. Either of these situations could also result in the imposition of fines.\nAdditionally, the European Union regulatory bodies have adopted the EU MDR and the EU IVDR, each of which impose stricter requirements than prior European Union directives with respect to the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical data requirements, evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2021 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the European Union and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspection by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our third-party suppliers must comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation or current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements (depending on the products at issue).\nAny future failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in enforcement actions.\nAny FDA sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nOur inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.\nOur products are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. Most medical devices cannot be marketed in the U.S. without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the FDA. Our inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, necessary clearances or approvals for our new products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payers are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nWe are subject to fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In addition, we are subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business\narrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business.\nAs a substantial amount of our revenue comes from outside the U.S., we are subject to geopolitical events, economic volatility, violations of anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions and tariffs, decisions by local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe do business in over 85 countries and have distributors in approximately 70 of these countries. This exposes us to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility, anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf there are sanctions or restrictions on the flow of capital that prevent product importation or receipt of payments in Russia or China, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other similar anti-corruption laws in other countries. Generally, these laws prohibit companies and their business partners or other intermediaries from\nmaking improper payments to foreign governments and government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Global enforcement of such anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings. While we have an active compliance program and various other safeguards to discourage impermissible practices, we have distributors in approximately 70 countries, several of which are considered high risk for corruption. As a result, our global operations carry some risk of unauthorized impermissible activity on the part of one of our distributors, employees, agents or consultants. Any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on our ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nExport of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in the U.S. to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export authorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political dynamics, outside our control.\nFinally, any other significant changes in the competitive, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international business could have a material impact on our business.\nWe sell our products in certain emerging economies which exposes us to less mature regulatory systems, more volatile markets for our products and greater credit risks. A loss of funding for our products or changes to the regulatory regime could lead to lost revenue or account receivables.\nThere are risks with doing business in emerging economies, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. These economies tend to have less mature product regulatory systems and more volatile financial markets. In addition, the government controlled healthcare system's ability to invest in our products and systems may abruptly shift due to changing government priorities or funding capacity. Our ability to sell products in these economies is dependent upon our ability to hire qualified employees or agents to represent our products locally and our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a less mature regulatory environment. If we are unable to retain qualified representatives or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to continue to sell products in these markets. We are exposed to a higher degree of financial risk if we extend credit to customers in these economies.\nIn many of the international markets in which we do business, including certain parts of Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia, our employees, agents or distributors offer to sell our products in response to public tenders issued by various governmental agencies.\nThere is additional risk in selling our products through agents or distributors, particularly in public tenders. If they misrepresent our products, do not provide appropriate service and delivery, or commit a violation of local or U.S. law, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to fines, sanctions or both.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel needed to successfully operate the business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and R&D positions. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. In December 2019, we relocated our corporate headquarters to a leased office space in Boston, Massachusetts. Although we believe our move to Boston will help us to attract and retain key talent and provide a dynamic space to engage our employees, competition for top talent in the healthcare market, and the increased cost or commuting time for current employees relocating or traveling to Boston could impact our ability to realize the intended results of the move.\nWe have also effected organizational and strategic changes in the last several years, including our Complexity Reduction Initiative, which have resulted in workforce reductions. If we fail to effectively manage our ongoing organizational and strategic changes in a manner that allows us to retain and attract talent, our financial condition, results of operations and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed. Additionally, to the extent our senior management or other key employees are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experiences delays in, or the suspension of, important strategic and commercial objectives.\nWe operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. Product liability claims could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our products or obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance.\nOur products are relied upon by medical personnel in connection with the treatment of patients and the collection of blood or blood components from donors. In the event that patients or donors sustain injury or death in connection with their condition or treatment, we, along with others, may be sued and whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable, we may incur significant legal expenses. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time.\nSuch litigation could damage our reputation and, therefore, impair our ability to market our products or obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance. While we believe that our current product liability insurance coverage is sufficient, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover incurred liabilities or that we will be able to obtain acceptable product and professional liability coverage in the future.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations or experience a disruption in our cash flows, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cost of borrowing.\nOn June 15, 2018, we entered into a five-year credit agreement with certain lenders which provided for a $350.0 million term loan (the \"Term Loan\") and a $350.0 million revolving loan (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\" and together with the Term Loan, the \"Credit Facilities\"). As of March 28, 2020, we had $323.8 million of debt outstanding under the Term Loan and $60.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2020, we borrowed an additional $150 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. The obligations to pay interest and repay the borrowed amounts may restrict our ability to adjust to adverse economic conditions and our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. The interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Facilities is variable and subject to change based on market forces. Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt.\nOur Credit Facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and make interest and principal payments. As of March 28, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants pursuant to our Credit Facilities, and we currently forecast that we will be in compliance with our credit facility covenants through the period ending April 3, 2021. If the impact of COVID-19 is more severe than currently forecasted this may impact our ability to comply with our Credit Facility covenants, and it not certain that we would be able to renegotiate the terms of our Credit Facility in order to provide relief related to the applicable covenants. If in the future we are unable to satisfy our Credit Facility covenants, and then were unable to renegotiate the terms thereof, we could be required to repay any borrowed amounts on short notice.\nOur operations and plans for future growth may require additional capital that may not be available to us, or only available to us on unfavorable terms.\nOur operations and plans for future growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nInternational revenues and expenses account for a substantial portion of our operations. In fiscal 2020, our international revenues accounted for 34.6% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes different forms. Reported revenues, as well as manufacturing and operational costs denominated in foreign currencies by our international businesses, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services sold by us into international markets, where payment for our products and services and related manufacturing and operational costs is made in local currencies.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic earnings mix, changes in the measurement of our deferred taxes and recently enacted and future tax law changes in jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in our operations, including headcount in Switzerland, Puerto Rico or Malaysia, could adversely affect our tax rate due to favorable tax rulings in these jurisdictions. We are also subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nWe are subject to income taxes, non-income based taxes and tax audits, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, as well as interpretations as to the legality under various rules in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Act, and we expect the U.S. Treasury to issue future notices and regulations under the Act. Certain provisions of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations as could interpretations made by the Company in the absence of regulatory guidance and judicial interpretations. The result of the upcoming U.S. presidential and congressional elections may result in additional U.S. tax law changes that could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for\nfighting base erosion and profit shifting. In addition, the OECD, the European Commission and individual countries are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries in light of the digital economy. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.\nStock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as economic and geopolitical conditions in general and to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our shareholders. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, shareholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices.\nOur share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOn May 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock over the next two years. Under the share repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase, from time to time, outstanding shares of common stock in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and in privately negotiated transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased will be determined by us and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements and compliance with the terms of loan covenants. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the program. Repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased our common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness. Refer to Note 7, Earnings per Share, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nThere is a risk that our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation in some countries.\nCertain countries, particularly China, do not enforce compliance with laws that protect intellectual property rights with the same degree of vigor as is available under the U.S. and European systems of justice. Further, certain of our intellectual property rights are not registered in China, or if they were, have since expired. This may permit others to produce copies of products in China that are not covered by currently valid patent registrations. There is also a risk that such products may be exported from China to other countries.\nIn order to aggressively protect our intellectual property throughout the world, we have a program of patent disclosures and filings in markets where we conduct significant business. While we believe this program is reasonable and adequate, the risk of loss is inherent in litigation as different legal systems offer different levels of protection to intellectual property and it is still possible that even patented technologies may not be protected absolutely from infringement.\nPending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. This type of litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Patent litigation may result in adverse outcomes and could significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel.\nOur products may be determined to infringe another party's patent, which could lead to financial losses or adversely affect our ability to market our products.\nThere is a risk that one or more of our products may be determined to infringe a patent held by another party. If this were to occur, we may be subject to an injunction or to payment of royalties, or both, which may adversely affect our ability to market\nthe affected product or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, competitors may patent technological advances that may give them a competitive advantage or create barriers to entry.", "PERMNO": 76837, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "HAE"}
