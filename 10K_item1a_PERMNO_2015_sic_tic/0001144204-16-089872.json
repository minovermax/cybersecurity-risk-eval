Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nFurther decline or deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a large degree on the general economic conditions in Central Virginia, which is our primary market. Our market is recovering from a significant downturn in which we saw falling home prices, rising foreclosures and an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies. If economic conditions were to deteriorate again, we could experience any of the following consequences, each of which could further adversely affect our business:\n\u2022 demand for our products and services could decline;\n\u2022 problem assets and foreclosures may increase; and\n\u2022 loan losses may increase.\nWe could experience further adverse consequences in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our market due to our exposure to commercial loans across various lines of business. A prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect collateral values or cash flows of the borrowing businesses, and as a result our primary source of repayment could be insufficient to service the debt. Another adverse consequence in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our market could be the loss of collateral value on commercial and real estate loans that are secured by real estate located in our market area. A further significant decline in real estate values in our market would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would provide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished.\nFuture economic conditions in our market will also depend on factors outside of our control such as political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military and fiscal policies and inflation.\nAn inability to maintain our regulatory capital position could adversely affect our operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, BVA was classified as \u2018\u2018well capitalized\u2019\u2019 for regulatory capital purposes. However, impairments to BVA\u2019s loan or securities portfolio, declines in BVA\u2019s earnings or a combination of these or other factors could change BVA\u2019s capital position in a relatively short period of time. If we are unable to remain \u2018\u2018well capitalized,\u2019\u2019 we will not be able to renew or accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on our deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in our market area. As a result, it could be more difficult for us to attract new deposits as our existing brokered and other deposits mature and do not rollover and to retain or increase non-brokered deposits. If we are not able to attract new deposits, our ability to fund our loan portfolio may be adversely affected. In addition, we would pay higher insurance premiums to the FDIC, which will reduce our earnings. Another adverse consequence of a decline in regulatory capital is that additional capital would be harder to raise.\nCordia may be unsuccessful in raising additional capital as needed, and a successful capital raise would dilute existing shareholders and possibly cause our stock price to decline.\nAt December 31, 2015, BVA was classified as \u2018\u2018well capitalized\u2019\u2019 for regulatory capital purposes. However, Cordia may have a need to raise additional capital to support growth and may be unsuccessful in raising additional capital if the market is not receptive to offerings by small community banks. Furthermore, if we are successful in raising additional capital, the issuance of additional equity securities could be dilutive to holders of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of any such sales. Management cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future equity offerings. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings. There is no assurance that any such offering or issuance of equity securities may be able to be completed.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses (\u201cALL\u201d) to provide for probable losses. Our ALL may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Our ALL is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolution, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, and industry information. Also included in management\u2019s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which are uncertain.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting impacted Cordia\u2019s and, subsequently, BVA\u2019s ALL. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all loans were recorded in Cordia\u2019s financial statements at their fair value at the time of acquisition and the related ALL was eliminated because the fair value at the time was determined by the net present value of the expected cash flows taking into account estimated credit quality. We may in the future determine that our estimates of fair value are too high, in which case we would provide for additional loan losses associated with acquired loans.\nThe amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and ALL. Although management believes that our ALL is adequate to provide for probable losses, there are no assurances that future increases in the ALL will not be needed or that regulators will not require us to increase our allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nBVA\u2019s small-to-medium sized business clientele may have limited financial resources to weather a prolonged downturn or continued stress period in the economy.\nWe target our commercial development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium sized businesses. These businesses generally have less capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact this major economic sector in the markets in which we operate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nChanges in the fair value of our securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had securities classified as available for sale totaling $46.2 million and securities classified as held to maturity totaling $25.5 million. At such date, the aggregate net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities totaled $461 thousand. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of the available-for-sale securities portfolio, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered at the maturity of the securities. In the case of equity securities that have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nWe conduct periodic reviews and evaluations of our entire securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors that we considered in our analysis of debt securities include, but are not limited to, intent to sell the security, evidence available to determine if it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost, and probable credit losses. Probable credit losses are evaluated based upon, but are not limited to: the present value of future cash flows, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security below its amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, the payment structure of the security, failure of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies. We generally view changes in fair value for debt securities caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with our experience. If we deem such decline to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not have any other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in our securities portfolio.\nBVA is subject to interest rate risk that may negatively affect its financial performance.\nBVA\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond BVA\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest BVA receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) BVA\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and (ii) the fair value of BVA\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, BVA\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nBVA may lose members of its management team and have difficulty attracting skilled personnel.\nBVA\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense and BVA may not be able to hire such people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel of BVA could have a material adverse impact on its business because of their skills, knowledge of BVA\u2019s market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, recent regulatory proposals and guidance relating to compensation may negatively impact BVA\u2019s ability to retain and attract skilled personnel.\nThe financial soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our financial exposure. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew capital rules generally require insured depository institutions to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to BVA. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and becomes fully effective in 2019. Beginning in 2015, BVA's minimum capital requirements were (i) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). BVA's leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. As of December 31, 2015, BVA exceeds all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III to be considered well capitalized on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.\nOur profitability may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal banking authorities. Many of the banking regulations that govern us are intended to protect depositors, the public or the insurance fund maintained by the FDIC rather than our shareholders. Banking regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. These requirements may constrain our rate of growth, and changes in regulations could adversely affect it. The burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes, and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position.\nIn 2010 and 2011, in response to the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008, significant regulatory and legislative laws were enacted resulting in broader reform and increased regulation impacting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate. The agencies most affected by the enactment were the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the way the agencies oversee the financial system. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on the profitability of Cordia, the value of assets held for investment or collateral for loans. They could require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors that include other banks, both large and small and numerous less regulated financial services businesses. In particular, there is very strong competition for financial services in the market areas in which we conduct our business. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, and many have substantially greater resources, such as greater capital resources and more access to longer term, lower costs funding sources. Many also have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Our larger competitors generally have easier access to capital, and often on better terms. Some of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured state-chartered Banks, national banks and federal savings institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nOther competitors are subject to similar regulation but have the advantages of larger established customer bases, higher lending limits, extensive branch networks, numerous automated teller machines, greater advertising-marketing budgets or other factors. Some of our competitors have other advantages, such as tax exemption in the case of credit unions, and lesser regulation in the case of mortgage companies and specialty finance companies. Deposit competition is strong among institutions in our primary market area.\nWe have operational risk that could impact our ability to provide services to our customers.\nWe have potential operational risk exposure throughout our organization. Integral to our performance is the continued effectiveness and efficiency of our technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and key individuals involved in our ongoing activities. Failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope. This includes but is not limited to operational or technical failures, unlawful tampering with our information technology infrastructure, terrorist activities, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support, as well as the loss of key individuals or failure of key individuals to perform properly.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us.\nAdditionally, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will depend, among other things, upon restrictions imposed by the reserve and capital requirements of Virginia law and federal banking regulations, our income and financial condition, tax considerations, and general business conditions. The payment of dividends is subject to prior regulatory approval.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.\nTo remain competitive, we must keep pace with technological change.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90964, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BVA"}
