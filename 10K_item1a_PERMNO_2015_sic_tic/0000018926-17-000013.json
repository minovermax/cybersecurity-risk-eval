RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. The following information should be read in conjunction with the other portions of this annual report, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of Part II and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of Part II. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, that arise in the future or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nRisks Affecting Our Business\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors.\nEach of our offerings to our residential and business customers face increasingly intense competition from a variety of sources under evolving market conditions. We expect these trends will continue. In addition to competition from larger national telecommunications providers, we are facing increasing competition from several other sources, including cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, technology companies, cloud companies, broadband providers, device providers, resellers, sales agents and facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network. In particular, (i) intense competition from wireless and other communications providers has led to a long-term systemic decline in the number of our wireline voice customers, (ii) strong competition from cable companies and others has impacted the growth of our broadband operations and (iii) aggressive competition from a wide range of technology companies and other market entrants has limited the prospects for our cloud computing operations. For more detailed information, see \"Business-Competition\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report.\nSome of our current and potential competitors (i) offer products or services that are substitutes for our legacy wireline voice services, including wireless voice and non-voice communication services, (ii) offer a more comprehensive range of communications products and services, (iii) offer products or services with features that we cannot readily match in some or all of our markets, (iv) offer shorter installation intervals, allowing customers to begin receiving services sooner after ordering, (v) have greater marketing, engineering, research, development, technical, financial and other resources, (vi) have larger or more diverse networks with greater transmission capacity, (vii) conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than us, (viii) are subject to less regulation, which we believe enables such competitors to operate more flexibly than us with respect to certain offerings, (ix) offer services nationally or internationally to a larger geographic area or larger base of customers, (x) have substantially stronger brand names, which may provide them with greater pricing power than ours, or (xi) have larger operations than ours, which may enable them to compete more successfully in recruiting top talent, entering into operational or strategic partnerships or acquiring companies. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to provide more attractive offerings, to charge lower prices for their products and services, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructure more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to changes in technologies or customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services, to provide more comprehensive customer service, to provide greater resources to research and development initiatives and to take advantage of business or other opportunities more readily. In the past, several of our competitors and their operations have grown through acquisitions and aggressive product development. The continued growth of our competitors could further enhance their competitive positions.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers terminating or reducing their usage of our services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) reduced traffic on our networks, (iv) our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital improvement projects, (v) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (vi) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new products or services.\nWe are continually taking steps to respond to these competitive pressures, but these efforts may not be successful. Our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected if these initiatives are unsuccessful or insufficient. If this occurred, our ability to pay our debt and other obligations and to re-invest in the business would also be adversely affected.\nRapid technological changes could significantly impact our competitive and financial position.\nThe communications industry has been and continues to be impacted by significant technological changes, which in general are enhancing wireless services and enabling a broader array of companies to compete with us. Many of these technological changes are (i) enabling customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks, (ii) displacing or reducing demand for our services, or (iii) enabling the development of competitive products or services. For years, improvements in wireless and Internet-based voice communications technologies have reduced demand for our legacy voice services, and these trends continue. More recently, continuous improvements in wireless data technologies have enabled wireless carriers to offer competing products, and we expect this trend to continue as technological advances enable these carriers to carry greater amounts of data faster and with less latency. Technological advancements have also permitted cable companies and other of our competitors to deliver faster average broadband transmission speeds than ours. Rapid changes in technology have also placed competitive pressures on our video, cloud and hosting businesses, and enabled new competitors to enter our markets. To enhance the competitiveness of certain of our services, we will likely be required to spend additional capital to install more fiber optic cable or to augment the capabilities of our copper-based services.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict or respond to changes in technology or industry standards, or to the introduction of newly-offered services. Any of these developments could make some or all of our offerings less desirable or even obsolete, which would place downward pressure on our market share and revenues. These developments could also require us to (i) expend capital or other resources in excess of currently contemplated levels, (ii) forego the development or provision of products or services that others can provide more efficiently, or (iii) make other changes to our operating plans, corporate strategies or capital allocation plans, any of which could be contrary to the expectations of our security holders or could adversely impact our operations. Our inability to effectively respond to technological changes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to service debt and fund other commitments or initiatives.\nEven if we succeed in adapting to changes in technology or industry standards by developing new products or services, there is no assurance that the new products or services would have a positive impact on our profit margins or financial performance.\nIn addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we may need, from time to time, to phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.\nFor additional information on the risks of increased expenditures, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduces our available free cash flow.\u201d\nOur legacy services continue to experience declining revenues, and our efforts to offset these declines may not be successful.\nPrimarily as a result of the competitive and technological changes discussed above, we have experienced a prolonged systemic decline in our local voice, long-distance voice, network access, private line and other legacy revenues. Consequently, we have experienced lower consolidated revenues in each of our last several years.\nWe have taken a variety of steps to counter these declines in our legacy services revenues, including:\n\u2022\nan increased focus on selling a broader range of higher-growth strategic services, which are described in detail elsewhere in this annual report;\n\u2022\nan increased focus on serving a broader range of business, governmental and wholesale customers;\n\u2022\ngreater use of service bundles; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions to increase our scale, enhance our business segment and strengthen our product offerings.\nHowever, for the reasons described elsewhere in this annual report, most of our strategic services generate lower profit margins than our legacy services, and some can be expected to experience slowing growth as increasing numbers of our existing or potential customers subscribe to our newer strategic product and service offerings. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the revenues generated from our new offerings will offset revenue losses associated with our legacy services. In addition, our reliance on third parties to provide certain of these strategic services could constrain our flexibility, as described further below.\nOur failure to develop new products and services could adversely impact our competitive position.\nIn order to compete effectively and respond to the changing communication needs of our customers, we continuously develop, test and introduce new products and services. Our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis could be constrained by a range of factors, including network limitations, support system limitations, limited capital, an inability to attract key personnel with the necessary skills, intellectual property constraints, testing delays, technological limits or an inability to act as quickly or efficiently as other competitors. In addition, new product or service offerings may not be widely accepted by our customers. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely and successfully develop and introduce new products or services.\nOur failure to continuously develop effective service support systems could adversely impact our competitive position.\nFor many of our services, we can effectively compete only if we can quickly and efficiently (i) quote and accept customer orders, (ii) provision and initiate ordered services, (iii) provide customers with adequate means to manage their services and (iv) accurately bill for our services. Development of systems designed to support these tasks is a significant undertaking that continuously requires our personnel and third-party vendors to adjust to changes in our offerings and customers' preferences, to eliminate inconsistencies between the practices of our legacy operations and newly-acquired operations, to eliminate older support systems that are costly or obsolete, to develop uniform practices and procedures, and to automate them as much as possible. Our failure to continuously develop service support systems that are satisfactory to our current and potential customers could adversely impact our competitive position.\nWe may not be able to successfully adjust to changes in our industry, our markets and our product mix.\nOngoing changes in the communications industry have fundamentally changed consumers\u2019 communications expectations and requirements. In response to these changes, we have substantially altered our product and service offerings through acquisitions and internal product development. Many of these changes have placed a higher premium on sales, marketing and product development functions, and necessitated ongoing changes in our processes and operating protocols, as well as periodic reorganizations of our sales and leadership teams. In addition, we now offer a more complex range of products and services, operate larger and more complex networks and serve a much larger and more diverse set of customers. Consequently, we now face greater challenges in effectively managing and administering our operations and allocating capital and other resources to our various offerings. For all these reasons, we cannot assure you that our efforts to adjust to these changes will be timely or successful.\nOur revenues and cash flows may not be adequate to fund all of our current objectives.\nAs noted in the risk factor disclosures appearing above and below, changes in competition, technology, regulation and demand for our legacy services continue to place downward pressure on our consolidated revenues and cash flows. During each of 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we experienced declines in revenues and net cash provided by operating activities as compared to prior periods. Our cash flows will be further impacted by other changes discussed herein, including anticipated increases in our cash tax payments prior to the pending Level 3 acquisition and additional post-retirement health care payments as a result of the depletion in 2016 of substantially all of the post-retirement benefit plan trust assets.\nWe rely upon our consolidated revenues and cash flows to fund our commitments and business objectives, including without limitation, funding our capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, dividends, periodic share repurchases, periodic pension contributions and other benefits payments. We cannot assure you that our future cash flows will be sufficient to fund all of our cash requirements in the manner currently contemplated. Our inability to fund certain of these payments could have an adverse impact on our business, operations or competitive position or on the value of our securities.\nWe could be harmed by security breaches, damages or other significant disruptions or failures of our networks, information technology infrastructure or related systems, or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\nWe are materially reliant upon our networks, information technology infrastructure and related technology systems (including our billing and provisioning systems) to provide products and services to our customers and to manage our operations and affairs. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our information technology infrastructure and related systems. As a communications company that transmits large amounts of information over communications networks, we face an added risk that a security breach or other significant disruption of our public networks or information technology infrastructure and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our business customers (which includes our wholesale and governmental customers) could lead to material interruptions or curtailments of service. Moreover, in connection with processing and storing sensitive and confidential customer data, we face a heightened risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 proprietary information on our public networks or internal systems or the systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers.\nWe strive to maintain the security and integrity of information and systems under our control, and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system disruptions. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, hardware or software vulnerabilities, fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or foreign nations, or could result from aging equipment or accidental technological failure. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on such other systems to deliver services to our customers.\nSimilar to other large telecommunications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees. Although some of these attacks have resulted in security breaches, to date, none of these breaches have resulted in a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. You should be aware, however, that defenses against cyber-attacks currently available to U.S. companies are unlikely to prevent intrusions by a highly-determined, highly-sophisticated hacker. Consequently, you should assume that we will be unable to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyber-attacks. Any such future security breaches or disruptions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, especially in light of the growing frequency, scope and well-documented sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.\nAdditional risks to our network, infrastructure and related systems include:\n\u2022\npower losses or physical damage, whether caused by fire, flood, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, vandalism or otherwise;\n\u2022\ncapacity or system configuration limitations, including those resulting from changes in our customer's usage patterns, the introduction of new technologies or products, or incompatibilities between our newer and older systems;\n\u2022\ntheft or failure of our equipment;\n\u2022\nsoftware or hardware obsolescence, defects or malfunctions;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in our processes or controls;\n\u2022\nour inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills to adequately maintain our systems;\n\u2022\nprogramming, processing and other human error; and\n\u2022\nservice failures of our third-party vendors and other disruptions that are beyond our control.\nDue to these factors, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service, and could experience more significant disruptions in the future.\nDisruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described networks and systems could:\n\u2022\ndisrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt (i) our operational or administrative functions or (ii) the operations of certain of our customers who rely upon us to provide services critical to their operations;\n\u2022\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our customers\u2019 end users, including trade secrets, which others could use for competitive, disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nrequire significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the resulting damages or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems;\n\u2022\nrequire us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches;\n\u2022\nrequire us to provide credits for future service under certain service level commitments we have provided contractually to our customers or to offer expensive incentives to retain customers;\n\u2022\nsubject us to claims for damages, fines, penalties, termination or other remedies under our customer contracts or service standards set by state regulatory commissions, which in certain cases could exceed our insurance coverage; or\n\u2022\nresult in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to prolonged litigation.\nWe could experience difficulties in expanding and updating our technical infrastructure.\nOur ability to expand and update our systems and information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing business needs is important to our ability to maintain and develop attractive product and service offerings. As discussed further under \u201cBusiness-Network Architecture\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report, we are currently undertaking several complex, costly and time-consuming projects to simplify and modernize our network, which combines our legacy network and the networks of companies we have acquired in the past. Unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects may lead to increased project costs or operational inefficiencies. In addition, there may be issues related to our expanded or updated infrastructure that are not identified by our testing processes, and which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the redesigned systems. Our failure to modernize and upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, including the delayed implementation of new service offerings, decreased competitiveness of existing service offerings, network instabilities, increased operating or acquisition integration costs, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources.\nAny or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nOutages or other service failures of networks operated by us or other operators could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us specifically or our industry generally. In either case, media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us or other operators, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation, governmental investigations or additional regulations. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMarket prices for many of our services have decreased in the past, and any similar price decreases in the future will adversely affect our revenues and margins.\nOver the past several years, a range of competitive and technological factors, including robust network construction and intense competition, have lowered market prices for many of our products and services. If these market conditions persist, we may need to continue to reduce prices to retain customers and revenue. If future price reductions are necessary, we will suffer unless we are able to offset these reductions by reducing our operating expenses or increasing our sales volumes.\nOur future growth potential will depend in part on the continued development and expansion of the Internet.\nOur future growth potential will depend in part upon the continued development and expansion of the Internet as a communication medium and marketplace for the distribution of data, video and other products by businesses, consumers, and governments. The use of the Internet for these purposes may not grow and expand at the rate anticipated by us or others, or may be restricted by factors outside of our control, including (i) actions by other carriers or governmental authorities that restrict us from delivering traffic over other parties' networks, (ii) changes in regulations, (iii) technological stagnation or (iv) changes in consumers' preferences or data usage.\nIf we fail to hire and retain qualified executives, managers and employees, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain executives, managers and employees with technological, engineering, product development, operational, provisioning, marketing, sales, administrative, managerial and other key skills. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in several of these fields. We compete with several other companies for this limited pool of potential employees. As our industry increasingly becomes more competitive, it could become especially difficult to attract and retain top personnel with skills in high demand. Our workforce reduction initiatives over the past couple of years have further increased the challenges of attracting and retaining talented individuals. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, none of our executives or domestic employees have long-term employment agreements. For all these reasons, there is no assurance that our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel will be successful.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.\nVideo streaming services, gaming and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than other Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these newer services continues to grow, our broadband customers will likely use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers. Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected markets. While we believe demand for these services may drive broadband customers to pay for faster broadband speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude us from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our operating margins, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have been accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others and will likely face similar accusations in the future, which could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or require us to seek third-party licenses.\nLike other communications companies, we have increasingly in recent years received a number of notices from third parties or have been named in lawsuits filed by third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We are currently responding to several of these notices and claims and expect this industry-wide trend will continue. Responding to these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our use of the applicable technology, and divert management\u2019s time and resources away from other business. In certain instances, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments. In the case of litigation, we could be required to pay damages or cease using the applicable technology. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our profit margins may decline or our operations could be impaired. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could significantly and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSimilarly, from time to time, we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents or other intellectual property from third parties to be able to offer new products and services. If we cannot license or otherwise obtain rights to use any required technology from a third party on reasonable terms, our ability to offer new products and services may be prohibited, restricted, made more costly or delayed.\nWe may not be successful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on various patents, copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Others may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, superior to, or otherwise competitive to the technologies we employ in our services or that infringe on our intellectual property. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring proprietary rights that are similar to or infringe upon our proprietary rights, or to prevent our current or former employees from using or disclosing to others our proprietary information. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may depend on initiating legal actions against parties who infringe or misappropriate our proprietary information, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. If we are unsuccessful in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur operations, financial performance and liquidity are materially reliant on various third parties.\nReliance on other communications providers. To offer voice or data services in certain of our markets, we must either lease network capacity from, or interconnect our network with the infrastructure of, other communications carriers who typically compete against us in those markets. Our reliance on these lease or interconnection arrangements limits our control over the quality of our services and exposes us to the risk that our ability to market our services could be adversely impacted by changes in the plans or properties of the carriers upon which we are reliant. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that the other carriers may be unwilling to continue or renew these arrangements in the future on terms favorable to us, or at all. This risk is heightened when the other carrier is a competitor of ours and may benefit from terminating the agreement. If we lose these arrangements and cannot timely replace them, our ability to provide services to our customers and conduct our business could be materially adversely affected.\nConversely, certain of our operations carry a significant amount of voice or data traffic for other communications providers. Their reliance on our services exposes us to the risk that they may transfer all or a portion of this traffic from our network to networks built, owned or leased by them, thereby reducing our revenues. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Segment Results\u201d included in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report.\nWe also rely on reseller and sales agency arrangements with other communications companies to provide some of the services that we offer to our customers, including video services and wireless products and services. As a reseller or sales agent, we do not control the availability, retail price, design, function, quality, reliability, customer service or branding of these products and services, nor do we directly control all of the marketing and promotion of these products and services. Similar to the risks described above regarding our reliance upon other carriers, we could be adversely affected if these communication companies fail to maintain competitive products or services, or fail to continue to make them available to us on attractive terms, or at all.\nOur operations and financial performance could be adversely affected if our relationships with any of these other communications companies are disrupted or terminated for any other reason, including if such other companies:\n\u2022\nbecome bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nsuffer work stoppages or other labor strife;\n\u2022\nchallenge our right to receive payments or services under applicable regulations or the terms of our existing contractual arrangements; or\n\u2022\nare otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments or provide services to us.\nReliance on other key suppliers and vendors. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure. Our local exchange carrier networks consist of central office and remote sites, all with advanced digital switches. If any of these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers and may be adversely affected if third parties assert patent infringement claims against our suppliers or us. We also rely on a limited number of (i) software vendors to support our business management systems, (ii) content suppliers to provide programming to our video operations, and (iii) contractors to assist us in connection with our network construction and maintenance activities. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, utilities or programming on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\nReliance on utility providers and landlords. Pending the sale of our colocation business, we operate a substantial number of data center facilities, which are susceptible to electrical power shortages or outages. Our energy costs can fluctuate significantly or increase for a variety of reasons, including changes in legislation and regulation. Several pending proposals designed to reduce greenhouse emissions could substantially increase our energy costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. Due to the increasing sophistication of equipment and our products, our demand or our customers\u2019 demand for power may exceed the power capacity in older data centers, which may limit our ability to fully utilize these data centers.\nPending the sale of our colocation business, we lease most of our data centers. Although the majority of these leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the lease, many of these renewal options provide that rent for the renewal period will be equal to the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal. Any resulting increases in our rent costs could have a negative impact on our financial results. We cannot assure you that our data centers in the future will have access to sufficient space or power on attractive terms, or at all.\nReliance on governmental payments. We receive a material amount of revenue or government subsidies under various government programs, which are further described under the heading \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters.\" We also provide products or services to various federal, state and local agencies. Our failure to comply with complex governmental regulations and laws applicable to these programs, or the terms of our governmental contracts, could result in us being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time. Moreover, certain governmental agencies frequently reserve the right to terminate their contracts for convenience. If our governmental contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from governmental programs or contracts, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nReliance on financial institutions. We rely on a number of financial institutions to provide us with short-term liquidity under our credit facility. If one or more of these lenders default on their funding commitments, our access to revolving credit could be adversely affected.\nRising costs, changes in consumer behaviors and other industry changes may adversely impact our video business.\nThe costs of purchasing video programming have risen significantly in recent years and continue to rise. Moreover, an increasing number of consumers are receiving access to video content through video streaming or other services pursuant to new technologies for a nominal or no fee, which will likely reduce demand for more traditional video products, such as the satellite TV services that we resell and our Prism TV services.\nNew technologies are also affecting consumer behavior in ways that are changing how content is delivered and viewed. Increased access to various media through wireless devices has the potential to reduce the viewing of our content through traditional distribution outlets. These new technologies have increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. Some of these newer technologies also give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis. All of these changes, coupled with changing consumer preferences and other related developments, could reduce demand for our video products and services.\nIf we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 38% of our employees were members of various bargaining units represented by the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. From time to time, our labor agreements with unions expire. Approximately 11,000, or 28%, of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire October 7, 2017. Although we typically are able to negotiate new bargaining agreements, we cannot predict the outcome of our future negotiations of these agreements. We may be unable to reach new agreements, and union employees may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and result in increased cost to us. In addition, new labor agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations in the future. To the extent they contain benefit provisions, these agreements may also limit our flexibility to change benefits in response to industry or competitive changes. In particular, post-employment benefits provided under these agreements could cause us to incur costs not faced by many of our competitors, which could ultimately hinder our competitive position.\nPortions of our property, plant and equipment are located on property owned by third parties.\nWe rely on rights-of-way, colocation agreements and other authorizations granted by governmental bodies, railway companies, carriers and other third parties to locate our cable, conduit and other network equipment on or under their respective properties. A significant number of these authorizations are scheduled to lapse over the next five to ten years, unless we are able to extend or renew them. Our operations could be adversely affected if any of these authorizations terminate or lapse, or if the landowner requests price increases.\nOver the past few years, certain utilities, cooperatives and municipalities in certain of the states in which we operate have requested significant rate increases for attaching our plant to their facilities. To the extent that these entities are successful in increasing the amount we pay for these attachments, our future operating costs will increase.\nOur business customers may seek to shift risk to us.\nWe furnish to and receive from our business customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with certain of our operations. Our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nOur international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\nOur international operations are subject to U.S. and other laws and regulations regarding operations in foreign jurisdictions in which we provide services. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, anti-competition laws, trade restrictions, tax laws, immigration laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. Many of these laws are complex and change frequently. Regulations that require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or the employment of local citizens may adversely affect our flexibility or competitiveness in these jurisdictions. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may materially restrict our ability to deliver services in various foreign jurisdictions or could be breached through inadvertence or mistake, fraudulent or negligent behavior of our employees or agents, failure to comply with certain formal documentation or technical requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our personnel, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business or our ability to operate in one or more countries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nMany foreign laws and regulations relating to communications services are more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations, particularly those relating to privacy rights and data retention. For example, all 28 member states of the European Union have adopted new European data protection laws that we believe could impact our operations in Europe and could potentially expose us to an increased risk of litigation or significant regulatory fines. Moreover, national regulatory frameworks that are consistent with the policies and requirements of the World Trade Organization have only recently been, or are still being, enacted in many countries. Accordingly, many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market. As a result, in these markets we may encounter more protracted and difficult procedures to obtain licenses necessary to provide the full set of products and services we seek to offer.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u2022\ntax, licensing, political or other business restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nuncertainty concerning import and export restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign regulation of overseas operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\neconomic, social and political instability, with the attendant risks of terrorism, kidnapping, extortion, civic unrest and potential seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\ncurrency and exchange controls, repatriation restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchallenges in securing and maintaining the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe inability in certain jurisdictions to enforce contract rights either due to underdeveloped legal systems or government actions that result in a deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022\nthe inability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlaws, policies or practices that restrict with whom we can contract or otherwise limit the scope of operations that can legally or practicably be conducted within any particular country;\n\u2022\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties, including those with which we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased taxes, increased communications or privacy regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in staffing and managing foreign operations.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control, and we cannot predict the nature or the likelihood of the occurrence or corresponding effect of any such events, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do business and may in the future do additional business in certain countries or regions in which corruption is a serious problem. Moreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\nWe may not be able in the future to acquire new businesses on attractive terms.\nHistorically, much of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. Our future ability to grow through additional acquisitions could be limited by several factors, including our leverage, debt covenants and inability to identify attractively-priced target companies. Moreover, we generally must devote significant management attention and resources to evaluate acquisition opportunities, which could preclude us from evaluating acquisition opportunities during periods when management is committed to other opportunities, tasks or activities. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attain future growth through acquisitions. See \"Risks Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Level 3\" for a discussion of certain specific risks raised by our pending acquisition of Level 3 and see the next risk factor immediately below for a discussion of certain general risks raised by acquisitions.\nAny additional future acquisitions by us would subject us to additional business, operating and financial risks, the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated, and could adversely impact our capital structure or financial position.\nIn an effort to implement our business strategies, we may from time to time in the future pursue other acquisition or expansion opportunities, including strategic investments. These transactions could involve acquisitions of entire businesses or investments in start-up or established companies, and could take several forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business, or the purchase of equity interests or assets. These types of transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of identifying appropriate companies to acquire or invest in on acceptable terms, distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue acquired to offset liabilities assumed, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, potential infringements, potential violations of covenants in our debt instruments and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. To the extent we acquire part or all of a business that is financially unstable or is otherwise subject to a high level of risk, we may be affected by currently unascertainable risks of that business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular business or assets that we may acquire. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the benefits of the transaction originally anticipated by us or that any such transaction will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In particular, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to successfully integrate the technology systems, billing systems, accounting processes, sales force, cost structure, product development and service delivery processes, standards, controls, policies, strategies and culture of the acquired company with ours. In addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional securities or the borrowing of additional funds.\nExcept as required by law or applicable securities exchange listing standards, we do not expect to ask our shareholders to vote on any proposed acquisition. Moreover, we generally do not announce our acquisitions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, including unstable economic and credit markets, could negatively affect our business. Worldwide economic growth has been sluggish since 2008, and many experts believe that a confluence of global factors may result in a prolonged period of economic stagnation, slow growth or economic uncertainty. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of these general economic conditions, they could adversely affect demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forego purchases of our products and services. These conditions impact, in particular, our ability to sell discretionary products or services to business customers that are under pressure to reduce costs or to governmental customers that have suffered substantial budget cuts in recent years. Any one or more of these circumstances could continue to depress our revenues. Also, our customers may encounter financial hardships or may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could negatively impact their ability to make timely payments to us. In addition, as discussed further below, unstable economic and credit markets may preclude us from refinancing maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. For these reasons, among others, if current economic conditions persist or decline, our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nFor additional information about our business and operations, see \"Business\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report.\nRisks Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Level 3\nThe completion of the Level 3 acquisition is subject to several conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities, which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the combined company or could cause the proposed transaction to be abandoned.\nThe completion of the Level 3 acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the receipt of approvals from the FCC and certain other governmental entities. In deciding whether to grant some of these approvals, the relevant governmental entity will make a determination of whether, among other things, the transaction is in the public interest. We cannot provide any assurance that the necessary approvals will be obtained.\nIn addition, regulatory entities may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval or in connection with their review. The merger agreement may require CenturyLink or Level 3 to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely affect the combined company without either of CenturyLink or Level 3 having the right to refuse to close the acquisition on the basis of those regulatory conditions. While we are not required to accept conditions that would or would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the combined company (assuming for these purposes that the combined company is the size of CenturyLink), this assessment will be made at or prior to the closing and we cannot provide any assurance that any required conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the proposed acquisition. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment of the acquisition.\nIt could take longer to receive the requisite governmental consents and approvals than currently anticipated. Any delay in completing the acquisition, whether caused by regulatory delays or otherwise, could cause us, Level 3, as well as the combined company, to incur extra transaction expenses or to delay or fail to realize fully the benefits that we currently expect to receive if the acquisition is successfully completed within the expected time frame.\nFailure to complete the acquisition could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Level 3 acquisition is not completed, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we could be required to pay Level 3 a substantial termination fee and, in some cases, certain expenses of Level 3 if the acquisition is terminated under certain qualifying circumstances;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of costs and expenses relating to the proposed acquisition, such as financing, legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees and expenses, including the potential expense reimbursement obligations described above;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of a change in the trading price of our common stock to the extent current trading prices reflect a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we could suffer potential negative reactions from our employees, customers or vendors; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we could suffer adverse consequences associated with our management's focus on the acquisition instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us, without realizing any of the benefits contemplated by the acquisition.\nIn addition, if the acquisition is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.\nIf the acquisition is not completed, we cannot assure you that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect our business financial results and stock price.\nOur merger agreement with Level 3 contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of us or could result in any competing proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be.\nOur merger agreement with Level 3 contains \"no-shop\" provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, encourage, facilitate or discuss competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of CenturyLink. In some circumstances on termination of the merger agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee or expenses to Level 3. These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay an attractive purchase price, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee or expenses that may become payable in certain circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated and we attempt to seek another business acquisition, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable or better than the terms of the Level 3 acquisition.\nThe pendency of the Level 3 acquisition could adversely affect the business and operations of CenturyLink or Level 3.\nIn connection with the pending Level 3 acquisition, some of the customers or vendors of CenturyLink or Level 3 may delay or defer decisions or reduce their level of business with either or both of the companies, any of which could negatively affect the revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses of CenturyLink or Level 3, regardless of whether the acquisition is completed. Similarly, current and prospective employees of CenturyLink and Level 3 may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the acquisition, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of CenturyLink or Level 3 to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing, operational and technical personnel during the pendency of the acquisition. In addition, due to operating covenants in the merger agreement, each of CenturyLink and Level 3 may be unable, during the pendency of the acquisition, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial. Any of these effects could have an adverse effect on the ability to generate revenue at anticipated levels prior to the completion of the acquisition. Moreover, the pursuit of the acquisition and the preparation for the integration of the companies may place a significant burden on the management and personnel of both companies. The diversion of management's attention away from operating the companies in the ordinary course could adversely affect CenturyLink's and Level 3's financial results.\nCurrent CenturyLink shareholders may have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the Level 3 acquisition.\nCenturyLink expects to issue or reserve for issuance approximately 538 million shares of CenturyLink common stock to Level 3 stockholders in connection with the acquisition (including shares of CenturyLink common stock to be issued in connection with outstanding Level 3 equity awards). Upon completion of the Level 3 acquisition, each CenturyLink shareholder will remain a shareholder of CenturyLink with a percentage ownership of the combined company that may be smaller than the shareholder's percentage of CenturyLink prior to the transaction, depending upon such shareholder's current ownership of Level 3 shares. As a result of these potentially reduced ownership percentages, CenturyLink shareholders may have less voting power in the combined company than they now have with respect to CenturyLink.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Level 3 acquisition.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the acquisition and integrating our business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with those of Level 3. There are a large number of systems that will likely be integrated, including management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll and benefits, fixed asset, lease administration and regulatory compliance systems. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Due to these factors, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition are likely in the near term to exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the acquisition. As a result of these expenses, we expect to take charges against our earnings before and after the completion of the acquisition. The charges taken after the acquisition are expected to be significant, although the aggregate amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nFollowing the Level 3 acquisition, the combined company may be unable to integrate successfully our business and Level 3\u2019s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nThe proposed transaction involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of CenturyLink and Level 3. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully combine our business and Level 3\u2019s business in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either of the two companies deciding to terminate or reduce their business with the combined company;\n\u2022\nthe complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel from the two companies, while at the same time attempting to (i) provide consistent, high quality products and services under a unified culture and (ii) focus on other on-going transactions, including the pending divestiture of our data centers and colocation business and related transactions;\n\u2022\nthe additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, regulatory restrictions, operating structures and markets;\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the acquisition and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nFor all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the combined company\u2019s management, the disruption of the combined company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in the combined company\u2019s products, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the combined company to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nFollowing the Level 3 acquisition, we may be unable to retain key employees.\nThe success of the combined company after the acquisition will depend in part upon its ability to retain key Level 3 and CenturyLink employees. Key employees may depart either before or after the acquisition because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the acquisition. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we, Level 3 and, following the acquisition, the combined company will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.\nIn connection with the Level 3 acquisition, we will incur and assume a substantial amount of indebtedness and the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed by us are expected to contain various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our ability to operate.\nAs a result of incurring the debt financing for the Level 3 acquisition and assuming Level 3's existing consolidated indebtedness in connection with the acquisition, we will become more leveraged. This could have material adverse consequences for us, including those listed below under the heading \"Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our high debt levels expose us to a broad range of risks.\"\nThe agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed by us in connection with the acquisition are expected to contain certain affiliate guarantees and pledges of stock of certain affiliates and various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, pledge property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interest, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain assets to any one person, among various other things. In particular, certain covenants contained in Level 3's indebtedness to be assumed by us may restrict our ability to distribute cash from Level 3 to other of our affiliated entities, or enter into other transactions among our wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, some of the agreements that govern the debt financing are expected to contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our and their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Certain of our debt instruments have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. For additional information, see \"Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nFollowing the Level 3 acquisition, we plan to conduct rebranding initiatives that are likely to involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers.\nPrior to the Level 3 acquisition, CenturyLink and Level 3 will each continue to market their respective products and services using the \u201cCenturyLink\u201d and \u201cLevel 3\u201d brand names and logos. Following the acquisition, \u201cCenturyLink\u201d will be the brand name of the combined company. As a result, we expect to incur substantial costs in rebranding the combined company\u2019s products and services in those markets that previously used the \"Level 3\" name, and may incur write-offs associated with the discontinued use of Level 3's brand names. We cannot assure you that customers will be receptive to our proposed rebranding efforts. The failure of any of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers after the acquisition, resulting in reduced revenues.\nConsummation of the Level 3 acquisition will increase our exposure to the risk of operating internationally.\nCenturyLink and, to a greater extent, Level 3 conduct international operations, which expose each of them to the risks described under the heading \"Risks Effecting Our Business-Our international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\" Consummation of the Level 3 acquisition will generally increase our exposure to these risks. In particular, our acquisition of Level 3 will increase our exposure to currency exchange rate risks and currency transfer restrictions. Moreover, the acquisition of Level 3's Latin American operations will expose CenturyLink to the economic and political risks of operating in those markets.\nLevel 3 has only recently generated net income, and has generated substantial net losses in the past.\nAs indicated in Level 3's consolidated financial statements included in its reports filed with the SEC, Level 3 has only generated net income for its three most recently completed full fiscal years, and generated substantial losses prior to then.\nCounterparties to certain significant agreements with Level 3 may exercise contractual rights to terminate such agreements following the Level 3 acquisition.\nLevel 3 is a party to certain agreements that give the counterparty a right under certain conditions to terminate the agreement following a \"change in control\" of Level 3. Under most such agreements, the Level 3 acquisition will constitute a change in control and therefore the counterparty may terminate the agreement upon the closing of the acquisition, subject to the terms and conditions specified in such agreements. Level 3 has agreements subject to such termination provisions with significant customers, major suppliers and providers of services where Level 3 has acted as reseller or sales agent. In addition, certain Level 3 customer contracts, including those with state or federal government agencies, allow the customer to terminate the contract at any time for convenience, which would allow the customer to terminate its contract before, at or after the closing of the acquisition. Any such counterparty may request modifications of their respective agreements as a condition to foregoing exercise of their termination rights. There is no assurance that such agreements will not be terminated, that any such terminations will not result in a material adverse effect, or that any modifications of such agreements to avoid termination will not result in a material adverse effect.\nWe may be unable to obtain security clearances necessary to perform certain Level 3 government contracts.\nCertain Level 3 legal entities and officers have security clearances required for Level 3's performance of customer contracts with various government entities. Following the acquisition, it may be necessary for us to obtain comparable security clearances. If we or our officers are unable to qualify for such security clearances, we may not be able to continue to perform such contracts.\nWe cannot assure you whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use Level 3\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards following the Level 3 acquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Level 3 had approximately $9.0 billion of net operating loss carryforwards, (\"NOLs\"), which for U.S. federal income tax purposes can be used to offset future taxable income, subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Code and related Treasury regulations. Our ability to use these NOLs following the Level 3 acquisition would likely be further limited by Section 382 if Level 3 is deemed to undergo an ownership change as a result of the acquisition or CenturyLink is deemed to undergo an ownership change following the acquisition, either of which could restrict use of a material portion of the NOLs. Determining the limitations under Section 382 is technical and highly complex. Although the parties, based on their review to date, currently believe that Level 3 will undergo an ownership change as a result of the acquisition, neither company has definitively completed the analysis necessary to confirm this. Moreover, issuances or sales of our stock following the acquisition (including certain transactions outside of our control) could result in an ownership change of CenturyLink under Section 382, which may further limit its use of the NOLs. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will be able to use the NOLs after the acquisition in the amounts we project.\nOur pending acquisition of Level 3 raises other risks.\nOur pending acquisition of Level 3 and, upon completion thereof, our ownership of Level 3 raise additional risks not described above. For additional information, see (i) the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC by us on February 13, 2017 and (ii) Level 3's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, as updated by its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our operations and a variety of claims relating to such regulation.\nGeneral. We are subject to significant regulation by, among others, (i) the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), which regulates interstate communications, (ii) state utility commissions, which regulate intrastate communications, and (iii) various foreign governments and international bodies, which regulate our international operations. Generally, we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority or licenses from these bodies in most territories where we offer regulated services. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining or retaining all licenses necessary to carry out our business plan, and, even if we are, the prescribed service standards and conditions imposed on us in connection with obtaining or acquiring control of these licenses may impose on us substantial costs and limitations. We are also subject to numerous requirements and interpretations under various international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, which are quite detailed and occasionally in conflict with each other. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we are always considered to be in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time. The agencies responsible for the enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations may initiate inquiries or actions based on customer complaints or on their own initiative. Even if we are ultimately found to have complied with applicable regulations, such actions or inquiries could create adverse publicity that negatively impacts our business.\nRegulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change, and the regulatory environment varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A substantial portion of our local voice services revenue remains subject to FCC and state utility commission pricing regulation, which periodically exposes us to pricing or earnings disputes and could expose us to unanticipated price declines. In addition, from time to time carriers or other third parties refuse to pay for certain of our services, challenge our rights to receive certain service payments, file complaints requesting rate reductions or take other similar actions that have the potential to reduce our revenues. Our future revenues, costs, and capital investment could be adversely affected by material changes to or decisions regarding the applicability of government requirements, including, but not limited to, changes in rules governing intercarrier compensation, state and federal USF support, competition policies, pricing limitations or operational restrictions. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations.\nChanges in the composition and leadership of the FCC, state commissions and other agencies that regulate our business could have significant impacts on our revenues, expenses, competitive position and prospects. Changes in the composition and leadership of these agencies are often difficult to predict, and make future planning more difficult.\nRisks associated with recent changes in regulation. Changes in regulation can have a material impact on our business, revenues or financial performance. Recent changes in federal regulations have substantially impacted our operations. In October 2011, the FCC adopted an order providing for a multi-year transition to a regulatory structure that reduces intercarrier compensation charges, redeploys universal service funding to newer technologies, and increases certain end-user charges. These changes, coupled with our participation in the new FCC support programs, has significantly impacted various aspects of our operations, financial results and capital expenditures, including the amount of revenues we collect from our wholesale customers and our receipt of federal support payments. We expect these impacts will continue in the future. For more information, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report, and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report.\nIn addition, during the last few years Congress or the FCC has initiated various other changes, including various broadband and Internet regulation initiatives including \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d regulations (as discussed further below) and actions that will restrict our ability to discontinue or reduce certain services, even if unprofitable. In 2016, the FCC initiated rulemaking regarding the regulation of business data services. This rulemaking, which remains pending, could adversely affect our operations or financial results. Many of the FCC\u2019s regulations adopted in recent years remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus increasing the difficulty of determining the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors.\nCertain states have recently taken steps that could reduce the amount of their universal service support payments to incumbent local exchange companies. If these trends continue, we would suffer a reduction in our revenues from state support programs.\nRisks of higher costs. Regulations continue to create significant operating and capital costs for us. Challenges to our tariffs by regulators or third parties or delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, such challenges could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers.\nOur business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to regulations or laws related to regulating broadband services, storing records, bolstering homeland security or cyber security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts, enhancing privacy, restricting data collection, protecting intellectual property rights of third parties, or addressing other issues that impact our business, including (i) the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities, and services are able to facilitate authorized electronic surveillance, (ii) the USA Freedom Act, which requires communication companies to store records of communications of their customers, and (iii) laws that have significantly enhanced our responsibilities relating to data security in certain jurisdictions. We expect our compliance costs to increase if future laws or regulations continue to increase our obligations.\nIncreased risks of fines. We have recently paid certain regulatory fines associated with network or service outages, particularly with respect to outages impacting the availability of emergency - 911 services. Over the past couple of years, we believe that regulators have assessed substantially higher fines than in the past for these types of incidents, and it is possible this trend will continue.\nRisks of reduced flexibility. As a diversified full service incumbent local exchange carrier in many of our key operating markets, we have traditionally been subject to significant regulation that does not apply to many of our competitors. This regulation in many instances restricts our ability to change rates, to compete and to respond rapidly to changing industry conditions. In particular, cable television companies in recent years have been able to exploit differences in regulatory oversight, which we believe has helped them to develop service offerings competitive with ours. As our business becomes increasingly competitive, regulatory disparities between us and our competitors could increasingly impede our ability to compete.\nRisks posed by other regulations. All of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental, safety, health and other governmental regulations. We monitor our compliance with federal, state and local regulations governing the management, discharge and disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials. Although we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations in all material respects, our management, discharge or disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials might expose us to claims or actions that could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. For a discussion of regulatory risks associated with our international operations, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business-Our international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\"\nOur participation in the FCC's Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") Phase 2 support program poses certain risks.\nOur participation in the FCC's CAF Phase 2 support program subjects us to certain financial risks. If we fail to attain certain specified infrastructure buildout requirements, the FCC could withhold future CAF support payments until these shortcomings are rectified. In addition, if we are not in compliance with FCC measures by the end of the CAF Phase 2 program, we would incur substantial penalties. To comply with the FCC's buildout requirements, we believe we will need to dedicate a substantial portion of our future capital expenditure budget to the construction of new infrastructure. The CAF-related expenditures could reduce the amount of funds we are willing or able to allocate to other initiatives or projects.\nRegulation of the Internet could limit our ability to operate our broadband business profitably and to manage our broadband facilities efficiently.\nIn order to continue to provide quality broadband service at attractive prices, we believe we need the continued flexibility to respond to changing consumer demands, to manage bandwidth usage efficiently for the benefit of all customers and to invest in our networks. In 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulate broadband services as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act. The ultimate impact of the new regulations will depend on several factors, including the manner in which the new regulations are implemented and enforced and whether those regulations are altered by the newly-constituted FCC or Congress. Although it is premature for us to determine the ultimate impact of the new regulations upon our operations, we currently anticipate that implementation of the proposed rules could hamper our ability to operate our data networks efficiently, restrict our ability to implement network management practices necessary to ensure quality service, increase the cost of network extensions and upgrades, and otherwise negatively impact our current operations. Our service offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state, local or foreign governments may adopt new laws or regulations, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet. We cannot predict the outcome of any such changes.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our network.\nAlthough we believe our liability for third party information stored on or transmitted through our networks is limited, the liability of private network operators is impacted both by changing technology and evolving legal principles that remain unsettled in many jurisdictions. As a private network provider, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to third party content stored or transmitted on our networks. Such claims could involve, among others, allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or aiding and abetting restricted activities such as online gambling or pornography. If we decide to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to these risks, or if we are required to defend ourselves against these kinds of claims, our operations and financial results could be negatively affected.\nAny adverse outcome in any of our pending key legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, on the trading price of our securities and on our ability to access the capital markets.\nThere are several material proceedings pending against us, as described in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. Results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. Any of the proceedings described in Note 16, as well as current litigation not described therein or future litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results. We can give you no assurances as to the impact of these matters on our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to franchising requirements that could impede our expansion opportunities or result in potential fines or penalties.\nWe may be required to obtain from municipal authorities operating franchises to install or expand certain facilities related to our fiber transport operations, our competitive local exchange carrier operations, and our facilities-based video services. Some of these franchises may require us to pay franchise fees. Many of our franchise agreements have compliance obligations and failure to comply may result in fines or penalties. In some cases, certain franchise requirements could delay us in expanding our operations or increase the costs of providing these services.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming. Any failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or our reputation with investors, lenders or others.\nChanges in any of the above-described laws or regulations may limit our ability to plan, and could subject us to further costs or constraints.\nFrom time to time, the laws or regulations governing us or our customers, or the government\u2019s policy of enforcing those laws or regulations, have changed frequently and materially. The variability of these laws could hamper the ability of us and our customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Moreover, future changes in these laws or regulations could further increase our operating or compliance costs, or further restrict our operational flexibility, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position, financial condition or prospects.\nFor a more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report.\nRisks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur high debt levels expose us to a broad range of risks.\nWe continue to carry significant debt. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate principal amount of our consolidated long-term debt, excluding unamortized discounts, net, unamortized debt issuance costs and capital lease and other obligations, was $19.879 billion. As of the date of this annual report, $2.715 billion aggregate principal amount of this long-term debt is scheduled to mature prior to December 31, 2019. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.\nOur significant levels of debt can adversely affect us in several other respects, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancings or other general corporate purposes, particularly if, as discussed further in the risk factor disclosure below, (i) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward or (ii) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, dividends, stock repurchases, marketing and other potential growth initiatives;\n\u2022\nhindering our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to plan for or react to changing market, industry, competitive or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nincreasing our future borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that third parties will be unwilling or unable to engage in hedging or other financial or commercial arrangements with us;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, or take other unfavorable actions to meet payment obligations; or\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we may not meet the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments, either of which could result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe effects of each of these factors could be intensified if we increase our borrowings.\nAny failure to make required debt payments could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or raise capital.\nOur debt agreements and the debt agreements of our subsidiaries allow us to incur significantly more debt, which could exacerbate the other risks described in this annual report.\nThe terms of our debt instruments and the debt instruments of our subsidiaries permit us to incur additional indebtedness. Additional debt may be necessary for many reasons, including those discussed above. Incremental borrowings that impose additional financial risks could exacerbate the other risks described in this annual report.\nWe expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that we intend to refinance over the next several years, principally through the issuance of debt securities of CenturyLink, Inc., Qwest Corporation or both. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position, performance, and credit ratings, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Global financial markets continue to be volatile. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by (i) general market conditions, such as disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, geo-political instabilities, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad and (ii) specific conditions in the communications industry. Volatility in the global markets could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize our ability to repay, refinance or reduce our debt obligations.\nWe may also need to obtain additional financing under a variety of other circumstances, including if:\n\u2022\nrevenues and cash provided by operations decline;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions weaken, competitive pressures increase or regulatory requirements change;\n\u2022\nwe engage in additional acquisitions or undertake substantial capital projects or other initiatives that increase our cash requirements;\n\u2022\nwe are required to contribute a material amount of cash to our pension plans;\n\u2022\nwe are required to begin to pay other post-retirement benefits earlier than anticipated;\n\u2022\nour payments of federal income taxes increase faster or in greater amounts than currently anticipated; or\n\u2022\nwe become subject to significant judgments or settlements, including in connection with one or more of the matters discussed in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, we can give no assurance that additional financing for any of these purposes will be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our credit facilities and other debt instruments. If we are unable to satisfy the covenants contained in those instruments, or are unable to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, the parties to whom we are indebted could accelerate the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness. Certain of our debt instruments have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument.\nAs noted above, if we are unable to make required debt payments or refinance our debt, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, issuing additional securities, reducing or terminating our dividend payments, cutting costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our lenders to restructure our applicable debt. Our current and future debt instruments may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to do some of these things on favorable terms, or at all.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings of us or our affiliates could limit our ability to obtain future financing, increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect the market price of our existing debt securities or otherwise impair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to CenturyLink, Inc.'s long-term debt and the long-term debt of several of its subsidiaries. Most of these ratings are below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d, which results in higher borrowing costs than \"investment grade\" debt as well as reduced marketability of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to any of these debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nA downgrade of any of these credit ratings could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nlimit our access to the capital markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\ntrigger the application of restrictive covenants in certain of our debt agreements or result in new or more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022\nimpair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder certain circumstances upon a change of control, we will be obligated to offer to repurchase certain of our outstanding debt securities, which could have certain adverse ramifications.\nIf the credit ratings relating to certain of our currently outstanding long-term debt securities are downgraded in the manner specified thereunder in connection with a \u201cchange of control\u201d of CenturyLink, Inc., then we will be required to offer to repurchase such debt securities. If, due to lack of cash, legal or contractual impediments, or otherwise, we fail to offer to repurchase such debt securities, such failure could constitute an event of default under such debt securities, which could in turn constitute a default under other of our agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at that time. Moreover, the existence of these repurchase covenants may in certain circumstances render it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us, or the removal of our incumbent directors.\nOur business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduce our available free cash flow.\nOur business is capital intensive, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue to be significant in the coming years.\nWe expect to invest additional capital to expand and enhance our network infrastructure as a result of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour regulatory commitments, including infrastructure construction requirements arising out of our participation in the FCC's CAF Phase 2 program, which are discussed further herein;\n\u2022\nincreased demands by customers to transmit larger amounts of data at faster speeds;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers' service requirements;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances of our competitors; or\n\u2022\nthe development and launch of new services.\nWe may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to respond to these developments in a timely manner, at a commercially reasonable cost or on terms producing satisfactory returns on our investment.\nIn addition to investing in expanded networks, new products or new technologies, we must from time to time invest capital to (i) replace some of our aging equipment that supports many of our legacy services that are experiencing revenue declines or (ii) convert older systems to simplify and modernize our network. While we believe that our currently planned level of capital expenditures will meet both our maintenance and core growth requirements, this may not be the case if demands on our network continue to accelerate or other circumstances underlying our expectations change. Increased spending could, among other things, adversely affect our operating margins, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nSimilarly, we continue to anticipate incurring substantial operating expenses to support our incumbent services and growth initiatives. We may be unable to sufficiently manage or reduce these costs, even if revenues in some of our lines of business are decreasing. If so, our operating margins will be adversely impacted.\nOur senior notes are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness.\nOur currently outstanding senior notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including, upon consummation of the Level 3 acquisition, any newly-incurred acquisition financing secured by subsidiary guarantees or pledges of stock of selected subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the stock that serve as collateral for any secured indebtedness would generally be available to satisfy our obligations under such secured indebtedness, and would not be expected to be available to satisfy other claims.\nAs a holding company, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their distribution of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, including the payment of amounts owed under our long-term debt. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us or, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing or cash management purposes, to make any funds available to us to repay our obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. State law applicable to each of our subsidiaries restricts the amount of dividends that they may pay. Restrictions that have been or may be imposed by state regulators (either in connection with obtaining necessary approvals for our acquisitions or in connection with our regulated operations), and restrictions imposed by credit instruments or other agreements applicable to certain of our subsidiaries may limit the amount of funds that our subsidiaries are permitted to transfer to us, including the amount of dividends that may be paid to us. Moreover, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of these matters.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue paying dividends at the current rates, or at all.\nFor the reasons noted below, we cannot assure you that we will continue periodic dividends on our capital stock at the current rates, or at all.\nAs noted in the immediately preceding risk factor, because we are a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will depend on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to furnish funds to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments.\nAny quarterly dividends on our common stock and our outstanding shares of preferred stock will be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to continue making any future dividend distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which reserves the right to change or terminate our dividend practices at any time and for any reason without prior notice, including without limitation any of the following:\n\u2022\nour supply of cash or other liquid assets is anticipated to remain under pressure due to declining cash flows from operating activities, increased payments of post-retirement benefits and our projected payment of higher cash taxes prior to the pending Level 3 acquisition and might be further negatively impacted by any of the potential adverse events or developments described in this annual report, including (i) changes in competition, regulation, federal and state support, technology, taxes, capital markets, operating costs or litigation costs, or (ii) the impact of any liquidity shortfalls caused by the below-described restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to lawfully transfer cash to us;\n\u2022\nour cash requirements or plans might change for a wide variety of reasons, including changes in our capital allocation plans (including a desire to retain or accumulate cash), capital spending plans, stock purchase plans, acquisition strategies, strategic initiatives, debt payment plans (including a desire to maintain or improve credit ratings on our debt securities), pension funding payments, or financial position;\n\u2022\nour ability to service and refinance our current and future indebtedness and our ability to borrow or raise additional capital to satisfy our capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends that we may distribute to our shareholders is subject to restrictions under Louisiana law and restrictions imposed by our existing or future credit facilities, debt securities, outstanding preferred stock securities, leases and other agreements, including restricted payment and leverage covenants; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash that our subsidiaries may make available to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments, may be subject to the legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions described in the immediately preceding risk factor.\nBased on its evaluation of these and other relevant factors, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decide not to declare a dividend on our common stock or our outstanding shares of preferred stock for any period for any reason without prior notice, regardless of whether we have funds legally available for such purposes. Holders of our equity securities should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to receive dividends.\nSimilarly, holders of our common stock should be aware that repurchases of our common stock under any repurchase plan then in effect are completely discretionary, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason regardless of our financial position.\nOur current dividend practices could limit our ability to deploy cash for other beneficial purposes.\nThe current practice of our Board of Directors to pay common share dividends reflects a current intention to distribute to our shareholders a substantial portion of our cash flow. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to apply to other transactions that could be beneficial to our shareholders or debtholders, including stock buybacks, debt prepayments or capital expenditures that strengthen our business. In addition, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business through acquisitions or increased capital spending may depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing.\nWe cannot assure you whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards, or when they will be depleted.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $11.9 billion. A significant portion of the state NOL carryforwards are generated in states where separate company income tax returns are filed and our subsidiaries that generated the losses may not have the ability to generate income in sufficient amounts to realize these losses. In addition, certain of these state NOL carryforwards will be limited by state laws related to ownership changes. As a result, we expect to utilize only a small portion of the state NOL carryforwards, and consequently have determined that as of December 31, 2016, these state NOL carryforwards, net of federal benefit, had a net tax benefit (after valuation allowance) of $131 million.\nIncreases in costs for pension and healthcare benefits for our active and retired employees may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.\nWith approximately 36,000 active employees, approximately 72,000 active and retired employees and surviving spouses eligible for post-retirement benefits, approximately 68,000 pension retirees and approximately 14,000 former employees with vested pension benefits participating in our benefit plans as of December 31, 2016, the costs of pension and healthcare benefits for our active and retired employees have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining our pension and healthcare plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, most of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022\ndecreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing interest rates and discount rates or other factors used to calculate the funding status of our pension and other post-retirement plans;\n\u2022\nincreases in healthcare costs generally or claims submitted under our healthcare plans specifically;\n\u2022\nincreasing longevity of our employees and retirees;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the continuing implementation, modification or potential repeal of current federal healthcare legislation and regulations promulgated thereunder;\n\u2022\nincreases in the number of retirees who elect to receive lump sum benefit payments;\n\u2022\nincreases in insurance premiums we are required to pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, an independent agency of the United States government that must cover its own underfunded status by collecting premiums from an ever shrinking population of pension plans that are qualified under the U.S. tax code;\n\u2022\nchanges in plan benefits; and\n\u2022\nchanges in funding laws or regulations.\nIncreased costs under these plans could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments to our pension plans. Any future material cash contributions could have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing our cash flows available for other purposes. Similarly, depletion of assets placed in trust by us to fund these benefits, such as those discussed elsewhere herein, will similarly reduce our liquidity by reducing our cash flows available for other purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our pension plans and our other post-retirement benefit plans were substantially underfunded from an accounting standpoint. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. For more information on our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations\u201d included in Item 7 of this annual report.\nFor additional information concerning our liquidity and capital resources, see Item 7 of this annual report. For a discussion of certain currency and liquidity risks associated with our international operations, see \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business-Our international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\"\nOther Risks\nWe face risks from natural disasters, which can disrupt our operations and cause us to incur substantial additional capital and operating costs.\nA substantial number of our facilities are located in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and other coastal states, which subjects them to the risks associated with severe tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, including downed telephone lines, flooded facilities, power outages, fuel shortages, damaged or destroyed property and equipment, and work interruptions. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance on our property (excluding our above ground outside plant) and may, under certain circumstances, be able to seek recovery of some additional costs through increased rates, only a portion of our additional costs directly related to such natural disasters have historically been recoverable. We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to obtain insurance for catastrophic hazard-related damages or, if obtainable and carried, whether this insurance will be adequate to cover our losses. In addition, we expect any insurance of this nature to be subject to substantial deductibles, retentions and coverage exclusions, and the premiums to be based on our loss experience. For all these reasons, any future hazard-related costs and work interruptions could adversely affect our operations and our financial condition.\nIf conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures could be materially affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, these events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWhile frequently presented with numeric specificity, the guidance and other forward-looking statements that we disseminate from time to time is based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to our business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and uncertain and are largely beyond our control. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our guidance or other forward-looking statements. For additional information, see \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Related Matters\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that we will not experience a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, including litigation brought by private individuals, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and our stock price.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders' equity.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 51% of our total consolidated assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report consisted of goodwill (excluding goodwill assigned to the colocation business and included in assets held for sale), customer relationships and other intangible assets. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, most of these intangible assets must be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. From time to time (most recently for the third quarter of 2013), we have recorded large non-cash charges to earnings in connection with required reductions of the value of our intangible assets. If our intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record additional significant, non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined to have occurred. Any such charges could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or ability to comply with financial covenants in our debt instruments.\nTax audits or changes in tax laws could adversely affect us.\nLike all large businesses, we are subject to frequent and regular audits by the Internal Revenue Service as well as state and local tax authorities. These audits could subject us to tax liabilities if adverse positions are taken by these tax authorities.\nWe believe that we have adequately provided for tax contingencies. However, our tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those that we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Because the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government may from time to time change existing tax laws or regulations or enact new laws or regulations that could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition.\nOur agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could limit another party\u2019s ability to acquire us.\nA number of provisions in our agreements and organizational documents and various provisions of applicable law may delay, defer or prevent a future takeover of CenturyLink unless the takeover is approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions could deprive our shareholders of any related takeover premium.
