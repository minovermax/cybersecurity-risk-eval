RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. Other factors that could affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations are discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also affect the Company's business operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nReferences to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this Risk Factors section refer to the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nThe Company may continue to face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and rapidly evolving. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that the Company or its clients may take in respect of the virus may result in a period of disruption, including the Company\u2019s financial reporting capabilities and its operations, and could potentially impact the Company\u2019s clients, providers and third parties. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in overall business activity and financial transactions, supply chain disruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. In response to the pandemic, many states, including those where the Company primarily operates, have taken preventative and protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego time outside of their homes and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the Company\u2019s operations during fiscal year 2020 and the Company expects that the pandemic may continue to materially affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations during 2021. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s future operating results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and governmental actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Banking and financial services have been designated essential businesses; therefore, the Company\u2019s operations are continuing. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on the broader economy and the markets that the Company serves are not fully known, nor is the ultimate length of the restrictions described above and any accompanying effects. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has taken action to lower the federal funds rate, which may negatively affect the Company's interest income, and therefore, earnings, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the Company announced programs to support its customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of borrowers have enrolled in programs to defer all loan payments for periods up to six months. These programs may negatively impact revenue and other results of operations in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 to clients, may adversely affect the business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies, as well as the trading prices for many other securities. The further spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the areas in which the Company operates. This could result in further decline in demand for banking products and services and could negatively impact, among other things, liquidity, regulatory capital and future growth. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of its customers and employees. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate, nor can the Company predict the level of disruption which will occur to the Company's employees\u2019 ability to provide the expected level of client support and service. If the Company is unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused\nby such disruptions, which could further adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, the Company may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business as a result of the virus\u2019 global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. The full extent is not yet known and the Company cannot predict the full extent of the impacts on its business, operations or the global economy as a whole.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the emergency actions taken by the United States government to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the United States economy.\nThe United States government has taken a number of actions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the United States economy. Among other steps taken, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate in March 2020, and also lowered the interest rate on emergency lending at the Discount Window and lengthened the term of loans to 90 days. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. Key provisions of the CARES Act include one-time payments to individuals, strengthened unemployment insurance, additional health-care funding, loans and grants to certain businesses and temporary amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. The Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) was tapped to lead the effort to loan funds to small businesses, in conjunction with banks. The Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury have also responded with lending programs under the CARES Act. Further, the Federal Reserve has intervened with a number of credit facilities intended to keep the capital markets liquid.\nThere can be no assurance that these interventions by the United States government will be successful in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is unclear what the cumulative effect of these extraordinary actions by the United States government will be on the economy as a whole and upon the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its clients, both in the short- and long-term.\nThe Company's business depends upon the general economic conditions of the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, and may be adversely affected by downturns in these and the other local economies in which it operates.\nThe Company's financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where it operates, including the State of West Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nContinued economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions, combined with continued oil price volatility, could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of the Company's loans and its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of West Virginia and Virginia and the specific local markets in which it operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services primarily to customers across West Virginia and Virginia. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company's products and services as well as the ability of its customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of its deposit funding sources. Moreover, approximately 29.2% of the securities in the Company's municipal securities portfolio were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within West Virginia and Virginia. A significant decline in general economic conditions in West Virginia or Virginia,\nwhether caused by recession, inflation, unemployment, changes in crude oil prices, changes in securities markets, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company's loans are secured by real estate concentrated in the State of West Virginia and the Commonwealth of Virginia, which may adversely affect its earnings and capital if real estate values decline.\nNearly 68.5% of the Company's total loans are real estate interests (residential, non-residential including both owner-occupied and investment real estate and construction and land development) mainly concentrated in West Virginia and Virginia, a relatively small geographic area. As a result, declining real estate values in these markets could negatively impact the value of the real estate collateral securing such loans. If the Company is required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values in satisfaction of any non-performing or defaulted loans, its earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could have significant effects on the Company's business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including tornados, drought and floods, epidemics and pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events or the fear of such events could have a significant effect on the Company's ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of its deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery and business continuity policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, tariffs and similar events and disputes, domestic and international, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Market interest rates have declined significantly. Such events also may adversely affect business and consumer confidence generally. The Company and its customers, and respective suppliers, vendors and processors may be adversely affected. Any such adverse changes may adversely affect the Company's profitability, growth, asset quality and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact has affected and will likely continue to affect the Company's business and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees, including illness, quarantines, social distancing practices, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and overall economic and financial market instability. The Federal Reserve stated in late February 2020 that it was closely monitoring COVID-19 developments and their effects on the economic outlook, and would act appropriately to support the economy. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points to between 0.0% to 0.25%. The Federal Reserve also announced it was purchasing Treasury bills until the economy reaches full employment and inflation stays at 2% and will continue to reinvest amounts of principal received by the Federal Reserve on its portfolio of treasury and agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Lastly, the Federal Reserve also reduced the interest it pays on excess reserves from 1.10% to 0.10%. The Company expects that such reductions in interest rates will adversely affect its net interest income, margins and profitability.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company is subject to additional risks of litigation from clients or other parties regarding its processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nIn March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law and included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, which opened in April 2020, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank is participating as a lender in the PPP. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In mid-April, 2020, the SBA notified lenders that the $349 billion earmarked for the PPP was exhausted. Later in April 2020, an additional $310 billion of PPP\nloan funding was authorized. Since the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. The Company may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that contacted the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding the process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company and is not resolved in a favorable manner, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company's reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.\nThe Company's non-residential real estate loans expose it to greater risks of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans, which may cause it to increase its allowance for loan losses, which would reduce net income.\nAt December 31, 2020, $1.17 billion, or approximately 80%, of the Company's loan portfolio consisted of non-residential real estate loans. Non-residential real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans expose the Company to additional risks because they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by collateral that may depreciate over time. These loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans. Because such loans generally entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, the Company may need to increase its allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans, which would reduce net income. Also, many of the Company's non-residential real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce earnings and capital.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of the Bank\u2019s clients relative to their financial obligations with it. However, the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond the Bank\u2019s control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. Management performs stress tests on the loan portfolios to estimate future loan losses, but additional provisions for loan losses could be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying management\u2019s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Bank\u2019s market area or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. The Company cannot predict with certainty the amount of losses or guarantee that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb future losses in the loan portfolio. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe earnings from the Company's investment in ICM will be significantly reduced if ICM is not able to sell mortgages.\nThe profitability of ICM depends in large part upon its ability to originate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market. Thus, ICM is dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) its ability to sell loans into that market. Volatile interest rate environments could increase this risk initially. However, past performance supports the Company's ability to fund the increase in ICM's production.\nICM\u2019s ability to readily sell mortgage loans is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises with substantial market influence whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these government-sponsored enterprises and other institutional and non-institutional investors or any impairment of the ICM's ability to participate in such programs could, in turn, adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company's largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s earnings depend primarily upon its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits and borrowings. Moreover, the loans included in the Company's interest-earning assets are primarily comprised of variable and adjustable rate loans. Net interest income is subject to interest rate risk in the following ways:\nl In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities. The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.\nl The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates decline sharply, loans may prepay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income. Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to maturity (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.\nl Re-pricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets re-price faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings. Moreover, if assets and liabilities re-price at the same time, they may not be by the same increment. For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by ten basis points; whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.\nFinancial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates. This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes to net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates. Interest rate risk is more fully described in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area and failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets where the Company operates. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of the Company's\ncompetitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Company can.\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\nl Ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\nl Ability to expand the Company's market position;\nl Scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\nl Rate at which the Company introduces new products and services relative to its competitors;\nl Customer satisfaction with the Company's level of service; and\nl Industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Company's competitive position, which could adversely affect its growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $4.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of its common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill and other intangible assets. If the Company were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, it would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely impact the value of, and the return on, the Company's financial instruments that are indexed to LIBOR.\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. In November 2020, the LIBOR administrator published a consultation regarding its intention to delay the date on which it will cease publication of United States dollar LIBOR from December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2023 for the most common tenors of United States dollar LIBOR, including the three-month LIBOR, but indicated no new contracts using United States dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. Publication of non-United States dollar LIBOR would continue to cease after December 31, 2021. Notwithstanding the publication of this consultation, there is no assurance of how long LIBOR of any currency or tenor will continue to be published. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published before December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, as applicable, or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Although the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has announced the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, SOFR may not gain market acceptance or be widely used as a benchmark rate. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other similar reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on, the Company's financial instruments.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risks.\nThe Company is focused on its long-term growth and have undertaken various new business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new to it, or in some cases, are in the early stages of development. From time to time, the Company may develop, grow and/or acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets for these products and services are not fully developed.\nFor example, the Company is involved in new innovative strategies to provide independent banking to corporate clients throughout the United States by leveraging recent investments in Fintech. The Company also acquired Chartwell in September 2019, which provides integrated regulatory compliance, state licensing, financial crimes prevention and enterprise risk\nmanagement services that include consulting, outsourcing, testing and training solutions. Given the Company's evolving business and product diversification, these new initiatives may subject it to, among other risks, increased business, reputational and operational risk, as well as more complex legal, regulatory and compliance costs and risks. Furthermore, the Bank has several large depositor relationships that are concentrated in the Fintech industry and the loss of any relationship could force the Company to fund its business through more expensive and less stable sources. Also, the Bank is engaged in relationships with clients in the payments, digital savings, cryptocurrency, crowd funding, lottery and gaming industries and any change in regulations could impact the Company from both an operational and regulatory perspective. As of December 31, 2020, total gaming deposits represent approximately 18% of the Company's total deposits.\nIn developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company's system of internal controls. All service offerings, including current offerings and those which may be provided in the future, may become more risky due to changes in economic, competitive and market conditions beyond the Company's control. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's investments in Fintech companies and initiatives subject it to material financial, reputational and strategic risks.\nThe Company's investments in various Fintech companies have had a significant impact on its results of operations, and it anticipates they will continue to have a significant impact on its results of operations in the future. Any investments where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control over the operating and financial policies of the investee, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company increases or decreases its investment by its proportionate share of the investee\u2019s net income or loss. Any investments where the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-01, where changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes arising from orderly transactions are recognized in net income. The Company also periodically evaluates its investments for impairment. Please refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, accompanying the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.\nAny earnings from the Company's Fintech investments can be volatile and difficult to predict. Furthermore, the Company invests in many of these Fintech companies for strategic purposes. Where the Company is a minority shareholder, it may be unable to influence the activities of these organizations, which could have an adverse impact on its ability to execute its strategic initiatives and successfully develop and implement the banking platform it is developing with these and other partners.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Company's business and dilute stockholder value.\nThe Company generally seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\nl Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\nl Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\nl Potential disruption to the Company's business;\nl Potential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\nl Possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;\nl Difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and\nl Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and therefore, some dilution of the Company's tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction.\nFurthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt the ability to meet its financial obligations.\nLiquidity refers to the ability of the Company to ensure sufficient levels of cash to fund operations, such as meeting deposit withdrawals, funding loan commitments, paying expenses and meeting periodic payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by the Company in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities. The source of the funds for the Company\u2019s debt obligations is dependent on the Bank.\nAny significant restriction or disruption of the Company\u2019s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nLimited availability of borrowings and liquidity from the FHLB system and other sources could negatively impact earnings.\nThe Bank is currently a member bank of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Membership in this system of quasi-governmental, regional home loan oriented agency banks allows it to participate in various programs offered by the FHLB. The Bank borrows funds from the FHLB, which are secured by a blanket lien on certain residential and commercial mortgage loans, and if applicable, investment securities with collateral values in excess of the outstanding balances. Current and future earnings shortfalls and minimum capital requirements of the FHLB may impact the collateral necessary to secure borrowings and limit the borrowings extended to their member banks, as well as require additional capital contributions by member banks. Should this occur, the Bank's short-term liquidity needs could be negatively impacted. If the Bank were restricted from using FHLB advances due to weakness in the system or with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, it may be forced to find alternative funding sources. If the Bank is required to rely more heavily on higher cost funding sources, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover these costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and financial position.\nInterruption to the Company's information systems or breaches in security, including as a result of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, could adversely affect the its operations or otherwise harm its business.\nThe Company relies on information systems and communications for operating and monitoring all major aspects of business, as well as internal management functions. Any failure, interruption, intrusion or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the customer relationship, management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.\nThere have been several cyberattacks on websites of large financial services companies. Even if not directed at the Company specifically, attacks on other entities with whom it does business, or on whom it otherwise relies, or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of the Company's business.\nCyberattacks on third-party retailers or other business establishments that widely accept debit card or check payments could compromise sensitive Bank customer information, such as debit card and account numbers. Such an attack could result in significant costs to the Bank, such as costs to reimburse customers, reissue debit cards and open new customer accounts.\nIn addition, there have been efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing.\u201d The ability of customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. Because the techniques used to attack financial services company communications and information systems change frequently (and generally increase in sophistication), attacks are often not recognized until launched against a target and the Company may be unable to address these techniques in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventative measures. The Company may also be unable to prevent attacks that are supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities and that may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world.\nThe occurrence of any such failure, disruption or security breach of the Company's information systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to the Company's customers, could damage its reputation and its relationships with its partners and customers, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability. These risks could have a material effect on the Company's business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change and failure to continually adapt to such change could materially impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, or deposit funds electronically with banks having no branches within the Company's market area, which could affect net income.\nTechnology and other changes allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches and open deposit accounts electronically. This process could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits, in addition to increasing funding costs.\nThe Company's operations rely on certain external vendors who may not perform in a satisfactory manner.\nThe Company is reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations. Accordingly, its operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. The Company maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure; (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition; and (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit its ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase exposure to environmental liability. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties which, if inaccurate, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is at risk for an adverse impact on business due to damage to its reputation.\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain customers and employees, and to grow our business is dependent on maintaining our reputation and having the trust of our customers and employees. Many types of developments, if publicized, can negatively impact a company\u2019s reputation with adverse consequences to its business.\nTo an increasing extent, financial services companies, including the Company, may face criticism for engaging in business with specific customers or with customers in particular industries, where the customers\u2019 activities, even if legal, are perceived as having harmful impacts on matters such as environment, consumer health and safety or society at large. Criticism can come in many forms, including for providing banking services to companies engaged in, for example, the gaming industry or cryptocurrency. Many of these issues are divisive without broad agreement as to the appropriate steps a company should take and often with strong feelings on both sides. As a result, however we respond to such criticism, we expose ourselves to the risks that current or potential customers decline to do business with us or current or potential employees refuse to work for us. This can be true regardless of whether we are perceived by some as not having done enough to address concerns or by others as having inappropriately yielded to pressures. This pressure can also be a factor in decisions as to which business opportunities and customers we pursue, potentially resulting in foregone profit opportunities.\nThe Company may also face criticism in response to changes in overall strategic direction, the addition of new lines of business, the exit of current lines of business or with openings or closures of certain banking centers.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nChanges in tax law may adversely affect the Company's performance and create the risk that it may need to adjust its accounting for these changes.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to the Company's taxes could have a material adverse effect on its performance. In addition, customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on customers could result in defaults on the loans and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which the Company has invested.\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions that could detrimentally affect its business.\nThe Company, primarily through the Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject it to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor further detail, please refer to the sections captioned Supervision and Regulation included in Item 1 - Business and Note 15 - Regulatory Capital Requirements accompanying the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nFailure to meet any of the various capital adequacy guidelines which the Company is subject to could adversely affect its operations and could compromise its status as a financial holding company.\nThe Company and the Bank are required to meet certain regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the United States Department of Treasury. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, the Company's financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and could compromise its status as a financial holding company. Please refer to the sections captioned Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements included in Item 1 - Business and Note 15 - Regulatory Capital Requirements accompanying the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, for detailed capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks.\nThe Company is a financial holding company and its sources of funds are limited.\nThe Company is a financial holding company and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to shareholders of the Company is derived primarily from dividends paid by the Bank. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to receive dividends or loans from its Bank subsidiary is restricted. Under federal law, the payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements. The Federal Reserve Board and/or the FDIC prohibit a dividend payment by the Company or the Bank that would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Please refer to the sections captioned Supervision and Regulation - Limit on Dividends included in Item 1 - Business and Note 15 - Regulatory Capital Requirements accompanying the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe inability of the Bank to generate profits and pay such dividends to the Company, or regulator restrictions on the payment of such dividends to the Company even if earned, would have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nIn addition, since the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation, reorganization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, which will generally take priority over the Bank\u2019s shareholders.\nRisks Associated With the Company's Common Stock\nThe trading volume in the Company's common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nShares of the Company's common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in December 2017 under the symbol \u201cMVBF\u201d and were previously traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. There has been limited trading in its shares over the last 12 months. If limited trading in the Company's common stock continues, it may be difficult for investors to sell such shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Also, the sale of a large block of the Company's common stock could depress the market price of the common stock to a greater degree than a company that typically has a higher volume of trading of its securities.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, its stock could be delisted, and the trading price, volume and marketability of the stock could be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s present listing standards, or that Nasdaq will not implement additional listing standards with which it will be unable to comply. Failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements could result in the delisting of the Company's shares from trading on the Nasdaq system, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, volume and marketability of the common stock.\nThe Company's stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. The Company's stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\nl actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\nl recommendations by securities analysts;\nl operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\nl news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\nl perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or its competitors;\nl new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\nl significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or its competitors;\nl failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\nl changes in government regulations; and\nl geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economies the Company serves; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes, crude oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause the Company's stock price to decrease, regardless of operating results.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends is not certain and it may be unable to pay future dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of The Company's common stock may be shareholders' sole opportunity for gains on their investment for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends in the future is not certain. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions and other factors that its Board of Directors may deem relevant. The holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, and if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. As part of its consideration of whether to pay cash dividends, the Company intends to retain adequate funds from future earnings to support the development and growth of its business. In addition, the Company's ability to pay dividends is restricted by federal policies and regulations and by the terms of its existing indebtedness. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. For further information, please refer to the section captioned Supervision and Regulation - Limit on Dividends in Item 1 - Business included elsewhere in this report.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company is exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Company is required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. At December 31, 2020, the Company has no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting; however, a material weakness could occur in the future. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a control deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. If the Company fails to maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that meets the requirements of Section 404, it may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Additionally, failure to comply with Section 404 or the report by the Company of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in its financial statements and its stock price may be adversely affected. If the Company fails to remedy any material weakness, its financial statements may be inaccurate, it may not have access to the capital markets, and its stock price may be adversely affected.\nThe value of the securities in the Company's investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets.\nDue to credit and liquidity risks and economic volatility, making the determination of the value of a securities portfolio is less certain. A decline in market value associated with these disruptions could result in other-than-temporary or permanent impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's accounting policies and estimates are critical to how it reports its financial condition and results of operations, and any changes to such accounting policies and estimates could materially affect how the Company\nreports its financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting policies and estimates are fundamental to how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management makes judgments and assumptions in selecting and adopting various accounting policies and in applying estimates so that such policies and estimates comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability or reducing a liability. Because of the uncertainty surrounding management's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated. For example, because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates, the Bank could need to significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the amount reserved. Any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior financial statements. Please refer to the section captioned Allowance for Loan Losses in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company's financial statements. Recent economic conditions have resulted in continuing scrutiny of accounting standards by legislators and regulators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to U.S. GAAP. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in it restating prior period financial statements or otherwise adversely affecting its financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models which may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate which could result in unexpected losses, insufficient allowances for loan losses, or unexpected fluctuations in the value of its financial instruments.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models used for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models the Company uses for determining its probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models used to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company's analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17151, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MVBF"}
