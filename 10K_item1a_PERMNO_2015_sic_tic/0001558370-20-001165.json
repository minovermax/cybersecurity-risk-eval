{"cik": "1581091", "company": "RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties. An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto before making an investment decision. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nWe have grouped our risks according to:\n\u25cf Risks Related to Our Business and Industry;\n\u25cf Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure; and\n\u25cf Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur results are tied to the residential real estate market and we may be negatively impacted by downturns in this market and general global economic conditions.\nThe residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in general economic conditions which are beyond our control. These conditions include fluctuations in short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, wage and job growth, levels of unemployment, home affordability, down payment requirements, inventory levels, consumer confidence, demographic changes, local or regional economic conditions and the general condition of the U.S., Canadian and global economies. The residential real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the residential real estate market. The residential real estate market could also be negatively impacted by acts of nature, such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and such events may lead us to waive fees in certain impacted areas. Climate change may negatively affect the residential real estate market. Changes in local, state and federal laws or regulations that affect residential real estate transactions or encourage ownership, including but not limited to changes in tax law in late 2017 that limit the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expenses and increase the standard deduction (thereby potentially decreasing the tax benefits of homeownership) and potential future tax law changes, such as further limiting or eliminating the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense, the application of the alternative minimum tax, and deductibility of real property taxes, could impact the residential real estate market.\nAny of the above factors, and other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause a decline in the housing or mortgage markets and have a material adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or home prices. This could lead to a decrease of the number of agents or franchises in our networks and reduce the fees we receive from our franchisees and agents, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market at favorable rates and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nOur business is significantly impacted by the availability of financing at favorable rates or on favorable terms for homebuyers, which may be affected by government regulations and policies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed to more closely regulate the financial services industry, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), an independent federal bureau, which was designed to enforce consumer protection laws, including various laws regulating mortgage finance. The Dodd-Frank Act also established new standards and practices for mortgage lending, including a requirement to determine a prospective borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, removing perceived incentives to originate higher cost mortgages, requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect. Rules implementing many of these changes protect creditors from certain liabilities for loans that meet the requirements for \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d (\u201cQM loans\u201d). The rules placed several restrictions on qualified mortgages, including caps on certain closing costs as well as limits on debt to income (\u201cDTI\u201d) ratios for qualified mortgages.\nCertain potential regulatory changes such as the termination by the CFPB of a regulatory exemption known as the \u201cQM patch\u201d for loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the requirement to implement a new uniform residential loan application (\u201cURLA\u201d) which may increase Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d) and other operational risks, and more activist supervision and regulation of housing finance at the state level may adversely impact the housing industry, including homebuyers\u2019 ability to finance and purchase homes.\nThe monetary policy of the U.S. government, and particularly the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., significantly affects the availability of financing at favorable rates and on favorable terms, which in turn affects the domestic real estate market. Changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies are beyond our control, are difficult to predict, and could restrict the availability of financing on reasonable terms at favorable interest\nrates for homebuyers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, a reduction in government support for home financing, including the possible winding down or privatization of GSEs could further reduce the availability of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market. No consensus has emerged in Congress concerning potential reforms relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a potential transition to alternative structures for the secondary market, so we cannot predict either the short or long term-effects of such regulation and its impact on homebuyers\u2019 ability to finance and purchase homes.\nFurthermore, many lenders have tightened their underwriting standards since the real estate downturn, and many subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer as common in the marketplace. While some loosening of credit standards and a resurgence of alternative mortgage products, including non-qualified mortgages has occurred, if these mortgage loans continue to be somewhat more difficult to obtain, including in the jumbo mortgage markets, the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes could be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile we are continuing to evaluate all aspects of legislation, regulations and policies affecting the domestic real estate market, we cannot predict whether or not such legislation, regulation and policies may increase down payment requirements, increase mortgage costs, or result in increased costs and potential litigation for housing market participants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to execute our strategies to grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe intend to pursue a number of different strategies to grow our revenue and earnings and to deploy the cash generated by our business. We constantly strive to increase the value proposition for our agents and brokers. If we do not reinvest in our business in ways that support our agents and brokers and make the RE/MAX network attractive to agents and brokers, we may become less competitive. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities to acquire other businesses, including select RE/MAX independent regional franchises, or other businesses in the U.S. and Canada that are complementary to our core business, particularly those offering differentiated technology. If we fail to develop, execute, or focus on our business strategy, fail to make good business decisions, fail to enforce a disciplined management process to ensure that our investment of resources aligns with our strategic plan and our core management and franchising competencies or fail to properly focus resources or management attention on strategic areas, any of these could negatively impact the overall value of the Company.\nWe may fail to continue our booj Platform rollout as expected or its effectiveness in attracting & retaining agents may be more limited than anticipated.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we acquired booj, a real estate technology company, primarily to develop and deliver core technology solutions designed for RE/MAX affiliates. We anticipate that this new technology will improve the RE/MAX value proposition and ultimately assist in attracting and retaining agents and franchisees. The technology platform developed by booj has been delivered to our U.S. Company-owned Regions in 2019. If the booj Platform is (a) delivered to additional regions later than expected, or (b) does not create a distinct competitive edge for franchisees and agents, or (c) has a poorer than expected adoption rate by our franchisees and agents, the introduction of such platforms may not be effective in attracting and retaining agents and franchisees.\nWe may be unable to acquire regional franchise rights in independent RE/MAX regions in the U.S. and Canada or successfully integrate the independent RE/MAX regions that we have acquired.\nWe continue to pursue a growth strategy of reacquiring select RE/MAX independent regional franchises in the U.S. and Canada to support our growth. The acquisition of a regional franchise enables us to focus on a consistent delivery of the RE/MAX value proposition, increases our revenue and provides an opportunity for us to enhance profitability. This growth strategy depends on our ability to find regional franchisees willing to sell the franchise rights in their regions on favorable terms, as well as our ability to finance, complete and integrate these transactions. The number of remaining\nindependent regions in the United States and Canada is limited and therefore we may have difficulty finding suitable regional franchise acquisition opportunities at an acceptable price. Further, in the event we acquire a regional franchise, we may not be able to achieve the expected returns on our acquisition after we integrate the acquired region into our business.\nIntegrating acquired regions involves complex operational and personnel-related challenges and we may encounter unforeseen difficulties and higher than expected integration costs or we may not be able to deliver expected cost and growth synergies.\nFuture acquisitions may present other challenges and difficulties, including:\n\u25cf the possible departure of a significant number of key employees;\n\u25cf regulatory constraints and costs of executing our growth strategy may vary by geography;\n\u25cf the possible defection of franchisees and agents to other brands or independent real estate companies;\n\u25cf limits on growth due to exclusive territories granted to current franchisees by former region owners;\n\u25cf the failure to maintain important business relationships and contracts of the selling region;\n\u25cf legal or regulatory challenges or litigation post-acquisition, which could result in significant costs;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nA prolonged diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired region or region that we may acquire in the future could prevent us from realizing anticipated cost savings and revenue growth from our acquisitions.\nThe failure to attract and retain highly qualified franchisees could compromise our ability to expand the RE/MAX and Motto networks.\nOur most important asset is the people in our network, and the success of our franchisees depends largely on the efforts and abilities of franchisees to attract and retain high quality agents and loan originators. If our franchisees fail to attract and retain agents and loan originators, they may fail to generate the revenue necessary to pay the contractual fees owed to us.\nAdditionally, although we believe our relationship with our franchisees and their agents and loan originators is open and strong, the nature of such relationships can give rise to conflict. For example, franchisees or agents/loan originators may become dissatisfied with the amount of contractual fees and dues owed under franchise or other applicable arrangements, particularly in the event that we increase fees and dues. They may disagree with certain network-wide policies and procedures, including policies dictating brand standards or affecting their marketing efforts. They may also be disappointed with our marketing campaigns. If we experience any conflicts with our franchisees on a large scale, our franchisees may decide not to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration or may file lawsuits against us or they may seek to disaffiliate with us, which could also result in litigation. These events may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur financial results are affected by the ability of our franchisees to attract and retain agents and loan originators.\nOur financial results are heavily dependent upon the number of RE/MAX agents and Motto offices in our global networks. The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring dues paid by our franchisee\u2019s agents and contractual fees paid by our franchisees or regional franchise owners based on the number of agents or offices within their respective networks. Competition for real estate agents and loan originators is fierce. Our competitors may attempt to recruit the agents and loan originators of our franchisees. If our franchisees are not able to attract and retain agents and loan originators (which is not within our direct control), our agent count and revenue may decline.\nCompetition in the residential real estate franchising business is intense, and we may be unable to grow our business organically, including increasing our agent count, expanding our network of franchises and their agents, and increasing franchise and agent fees, which could adversely affect our brand, our financial performance, and results of operations.\nWe generally face strong competition in the residential real estate services business from other franchisors and brokerages (i.e. national, regional, independent, boutique, discount and web-based brokerages), as well as web-based companies focused on real estate. There has recently been substantial investment in real estate technology, including companies aiming to use innovative technology to disrupt the real estate market. Upon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to renew their franchise with us, operate as an independent broker or to franchise with one of our competitors. Competing franchisors may offer franchisees fees that are lower than those we charge, or that are more attractive in particular markets. Further, some of our largest competitors may have greater financial resources and larger budgets than we do to invest in technology and enhance their value proposition to agents, brokers and consumers. To remain competitive in the sale of franchises and to retain our existing franchisees at the time of the renewal of their franchise agreements, we may have to reduce the cost of renewals and/or the recurring monthly fees we charge our franchisees. We may have to offer incentives to encourage franchisees to recruit new agents. In addition, even with these measures, franchisees may choose not to renew their franchise, or may not recruit new agents.\nAs a result of this competition, we may face many challenges in adding franchises and attracting agents in new and existing markets to expand our network, as well as other challenges such as:\n\u25cf selection and availability of suitable markets;\n\u25cf finding qualified franchisees in these markets who are interested in opening franchises on terms that are favorable to us;\n\u25cf increasing our local brand awareness in new markets;\n\u25cf attracting and training of qualified local agents; and\n\u25cf general economic and business conditions.\nThe real estate market may be negatively impacted by industry changes as the result of certain class action lawsuits.\nIn March and April of 2019, three putative class action complaints were filed against National Association of Realtors (\u201cNAR\u201d), Realogy Holdings Corp., HomeServices of America, Inc, RE/MAX Holdings, and Keller Williams Realty, Inc. The first was filed on March 6, 2019, by plaintiff Christopher Moehrl in the Northern District of Illinois. The second was filed on April 15, 2019, by plaintiff Sawbill Strategies, Inc., also in the Northern District of Illinois. These two actions have now been consolidated. A third action was filed by plaintiffs Joshua Sitzer and four other individual plaintiffs in the Western District of Missouri. The complaints (collectively \u201cMoehrl/Sitzer suits\u201d) make substantially similar allegations and seek substantially similar relief. The plaintiffs allege that a NAR rule requires brokers to make a blanket, non-negotiable offer of buyer broker compensation when listing a property, resulting in inflated costs to sellers in violation of federal antitrust law. They further allege that certain defendants use their agreements with franchisees to require adherence to the NAR rule in violation of federal antitrust law. Amended complaints add allegations regarding buyer steering and non-disclosure of buyer-broker compensation to the buyer. These lawsuits have also prompted discussion of regulatory changes by various governments or rules established by local or state real estate boards or multiple listing services. The resolution of these complaints and/or such regulatory changes may require changes to our or our brokers business model, including changes in broker compensation. This could reduce the fees we receive from our franchisees, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant adoption by consumers of alternatives to full-service agents or loan originators could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nA significant increase in consumer use of technology that eliminates or minimizes the role of the real estate agent or mortgage loan originator could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations. These options include direct-buyer companies (also called iBuyers) that purchase directly from the seller at below-market rates in exchange for speed and convenience, and then resell them shortly thereafter at market prices, and discounters who reduce the role of the agent in order to offer sellers a low commission or a flat fee while giving rebates to buyers. How consumers want to buy or sell houses and finance their purchase will determine if these models reduce or replace the long-standing preference for full-service agents and loan originators.\nOur financial results are affected directly by the operating results of franchisees and their agents and loan originators, over whom we do not have direct control.\nOur financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees and, for RE/MAX, their agents and for Motto Mortgage, their loan originators. We have limited control over these parties, particularly in Independent Regions where we exercise less control over franchisees than in Company-owned Regions. Our franchisees operate in intensely competitive markets and we have little visibility into the results of their operations. If our franchisees\u2019 financial results worsen, our revenue may decline. We terminate franchisees for non-payment, non-reporting and other non-compliance with their franchise agreements and we may terminate franchisees more frequently in the future.\nOur franchisees and their agents or loan originators could take actions that could harm our business.\nOur franchisees are independent businesses and the agents and loan originators who work within these brokerages are independent contractors or employees of the brokerages and, as such, are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. Franchisees may not operate real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses in a manner consistent with industry standards, or may not attract and retain qualified independent contractor agents and loan originators. If franchisees and agents and loan originators were to provide diminished quality of service to customers, engage in fraud, misconduct, negligence or otherwise violate the law or realtor codes of ethics, our image and reputation may suffer materially and we may become subject to liability claims based upon such actions. Any such incidents could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBrand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees, our growth strategies or the ordinary course of our business or our franchisees\u2019 business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control and may damage our brand, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their agents and loan originators relating to health, safety, welfare or other matters; litigation and claims; failure to maintain high ethical and social standards for all of our operations and activities; failure to comply with local laws and regulations; and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us, which may result in a decrease in our total agent and loan office count and, ultimately, lower revenues, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAn organized franchisee association could pose risks to our ability to set the terms of our franchise agreements and our pricing. A group of broker/owners from around the country have founded and committed to the continued success and funding of the RMX Association (RMXA), an independent association of RE/MAX franchisees, whose goal is to work in partnership with RE/MAX, LLC and each other to improve, enhance and grow the brand into the future and protect assets and grow profitability as franchisees.\nThe failure of Independent Region owners to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions could adversely impact our revenue and earnings.\nWe have sold regional master franchises in the U.S. and Canada and have sold and continue to sell regional master franchises in our global locations outside of Canada. While we are pursuing a strategy to acquire select regional\nfranchise rights in the U.S. and Canada, we still rely on independent regional master franchises in Independent Regions, and in all regions located outside the U.S. and Canada. We depend on Independent Regions, which have the exclusive right to grant franchises within a particular region, to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions and to monitor franchisees\u2019 use of our brand. The failure of any of these Independent Region owners to do these things, or the termination of an agreement with a regional master franchisee could delay the development of a particular franchised area, interrupt the operation of our brand in a particular market or markets while we seek alternative methods to develop our franchises in the area, and weaken our brand image. Such an event could result in lower revenue for us, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe real estate business is highly regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and are subject to requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the jurisdictions in which they do business.\nOur franchisees (other than in commercial brokerage transactions) must comply with RESPA. RESPA and comparable state statutes, among other things, restrict payments which real estate brokers, agents and other settlement service providers may receive for the referral of business to other settlement service providers in connection with the closing of real estate transactions. Such laws may to some extent restrict preferred vendor arrangements involving our franchisees. RESPA and similar state laws also require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests that a broker has with providers of real estate settlement services.\nThere is a risk that we and our franchisees could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nWe, or our franchisees, are also subject to various other rules and regulations such as:\n\u25cf the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information;\n\u25cf the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and various other laws protecting consumer data;\n\u25cf the USA PATRIOT Act;\n\u25cf restrictions on transactions with persons on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury;\n\u25cf federal and state \u201cDo Not Call,\u201d \u201cDo Not Fax,\u201d and \u201cDo Not E-Mail\u201d laws;\n\u25cf the Fair Housing Act;\n\u25cf laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that impose sanctions on improper payments;\n\u25cf laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business;\n\u25cf state and federal employment laws and regulations, including any changes that would require reclassification of independent contractors to employee status, and wage and hour regulations;\n\u25cf and\n\u25cf consumer fraud statutes.\nOur or our franchisees\u2019 failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties, injunctions and/or potential criminal violations. Any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur franchising activities are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations regarding franchises, and any failure to comply with such existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have \u201cfranchise relationship laws\u201d or \u201cbusiness opportunity laws\u201d that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. We believe that our franchising procedures, as well as any applicable state-specific procedures, comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we offer new franchise arrangements. However, noncompliance could reduce anticipated revenue, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMost of our RE/MAX franchisees self-report their agent counts and agent commissions which drives the fees due to us, and we have limited tools to validate or verify these reports. This could impact our ability to collect revenue owed to us by our Independent Regions, franchisees, and agents, and could affect our ability to forecast our performance accurately.\nUnder our franchise agreements, franchisees, including independent regions, self-report (a) the number of agents and (b) gross commissions and other statistics from home sale transactions. This data is used to determine our billings for continuing franchise fees, annual dues and broker fees. We may have limited methods of validating the data and must rely on reports submitted and our internal protocols for verifying the reasonableness of the data. If franchisees were to underreport or erroneously report such data, even if unintentionally, we may not receive all of the revenues due to us. In addition, to the extent that we were underpaid, we may not have a definitive method for determining such underpayment. If a material number of our franchisees were to underreport or erroneously report their agent counts, agent commissions or fees due to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. Further, agent count is a key performance indicator (KPI), and incomplete information, or information that is not reported in a timely manner could impair our ability to evaluate and forecast key business drivers and financial performance.\nAttrition of legacy booj customers could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe booj business we acquired in February 2018 continues to service legacy customers, unrelated to RE/MAX. Several legacy customers have discontinued their relationship with booj, causing revenue to decrease. There is a risk that the remaining legacy customers leave at a faster pace than anticipated resulting in an accelerating decline in revenue.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition.\nSuch litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, securities litigation including class actions and shareholder derivative litigation, complaints from or litigation by franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements and franchising arrangements.\nIn addition, litigation against a franchisee or its affiliated sales agents by third parties, whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, may also include claims against us for liability by virtue of the franchise relationship. Franchisees may fail to obtain insurance naming the Company as an additional insured on such claims. In addition to increasing franchisees\u2019 costs and limiting the funds available to pay us contractual fees and dues and reducing the execution of new franchise arrangements, claims against us (including vicarious liability claims) divert our management resources and could cause adverse publicity, which may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable.\nOur global operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation, including difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems and reduced protection of intellectual property. A substantial unsatisfied judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could result in bankruptcy, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur global operations, including those in Canada, are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.\nThe risks involved in our global operations and relationships could result in losses against which we are not insured and therefore affect our profitability. These risks include:\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to changes in the Canadian dollar and Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates;\n\u25cf exposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the agents of our franchisees;\n\u25cf economic and/or credit conditions abroad;\n\u25cf potential adverse changes in the political stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the U.S.;\n\u25cf restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u25cf government policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u25cf diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u25cf withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf changes in tax laws regarding taxation of foreign profits.\nOur global operations outside Canada generally generate substantially lower average revenue per agent than our U.S. and Canadian operations.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition.\nRE/MAX is a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and the Motto brand is gaining recognition. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \u201cRE/MAX\u201d and Motto brands is critical to growing our business. If we do not successfully build and maintain strong brands, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe derive significant benefit from our market share leadership and our ability to make claims regarding the same, including through use of our slogan that \u201cNobody in the world sells more real estate than RE/MAX\u201d as measured by residential transaction sides. Loss of market leadership, and as a result an inability to tout the same, may hinder public and industry perception of RE/MAX as a leader in the real estate market and hurt agent recruitment and franchise sales as a result.\nInasmuch as our business is in part dependent on strong brands, our business may be subject to risks related to events and circumstances that have a negative impact on our brands. If we are exposed to adverse publicity or events that do damage to our brands and/or image, our business may suffer material adverse effects from the deterioration in our brand and image.\nInfringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our RE/MAX trademark, balloon logo and yard sign design trademarks and our Motto trademarks as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brands. We believe that this and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. Not all of the trademarks or service marks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of those countries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nWe are commonly involved in numerous proceedings, generally on a small scale, to enforce our intellectual property and protect our brands. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks, including uses that are currently unknown to us, could diminish the value of our brand and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand and impair our ability to compete effectively.\nIn addition, franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements and our brand standards may reduce the overall goodwill of our brand, whether through diminished consumer perception of our brand, dilution of our intellectual property, the failure to meet the FTC guidelines or applicable state laws, or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices.\nOur business is heavily reliant on technology and product development for certain key aspects of our operations.\nThe systems may not perform as desired or we may experience cost overages, delays, or other factors that may distract our management from our business, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, we may not be able to obtain future new technologies and systems, or to replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. Also, we may not achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system, including those related to our recent technology acquisitions.\nWe rely on traffic to our websites, including our flagship websites, remax.com and mottomortgage.com, directed from search engines. If our websites fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our websites could decline and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract home buyers and sellers to our websites, including our flagship websites, remax.com and mottomortgage.com through unpaid Internet search results on search engines. The number of users we attract from search engines is due in large part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, such as changes in ranking algorithms, many of which are not under our direct control, and they may change frequently. In addition, our website faces increasing competition for audience from real estate portal websites, such as Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nCyberattacks, security breaches and improper access to, disclosure or deletion of our data, personally identifiable information we collect, or business records could harm our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur information technologies and systems and those of our third-party hosted services are vulnerable to breach, damage or interruption from various causes, including: (i) natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism, (ii) power losses, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses and corruption of data, and similar events, and (iii) employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Of particular risk and focus in recent years is the potential penetration of internal or outsourced systems by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information (aka, cyberattacks). Cyberattacks, including the use of phishing and malware, continue to grow in sophistication making it impossible for us to mitigate all of these risks. Any extended interruption of our systems or exposure of sensitive data to third parties could cause significant damage to our business or our brand, for which our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nIn addition, we rely on the collection and use of personally identifiable information from franchisees, agents and consumers to conduct our business and in certain instances such data may include social security numbers, payment card numbers, or customer financial information. Global privacy legislation (including the recently enacted GDPR regulations in the European Union), enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. Changes in these laws may limit our data access, use, and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and requires covered businesses to, among other things, provide disclosures to California consumers regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such consumers\u2019 personal information and afford such consumers new rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt out of certain sales of personal information. We believe that further increased regulation in additional jurisdictions is likely in the area of data privacy. Should we misuse or improperly store the personally identifiable information that we collect, or should we be the victim of a cyberattack that results in improper access to such personally identifiable information, we may be subject to legal claims and regulatory scrutiny. Any legal claims, government action or damage to our reputation due to actions, or the perception that we are taking actions, inconsistent with the terms of our privacy statement, consumer expectations, or privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, could expose us to liability and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAny disruption to our websites or lead generation tools could harm our business.\nWe are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with websites, which include our lead referral system, remax.com, global.remax.com, theremaxcollection.com, remaxcommercial.com and mottomortgage.com. These risks include changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns. We may experience service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including reliance on our third-party hosted services, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, and denial of service, fraud or attacks. Our failure to address these risks and uncertainties successfully could reduce our Internet presence, generate fewer leads for our agents and damage our brand. Many of the risks relating to our website operations are beyond our control.\nWe only have two primary facilities, one of which serves as our corporate headquarters. If we encounter difficulties associated with these facilities, we could face management issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe have two primary facilities both located in Denver, Colorado, where most of our employees are located. A significant portion of our owned computer equipment, IT team focused on agent technology, and our management is located in these facilities. Our management and employees would need to find an alternative location if we were to encounter difficulties at our corporate headquarters, including by fire or other natural disaster, which would cause disruption and expense to our business and operations.\nWe rely on third parties for certain important functions and technology. Any failures by those vendors could disrupt our business operations.\nWe have outsourced certain key functions to external parties, including some that are critical to financial reporting, our franchise and membership tracking/billing, the Motto loan origination system, and a number of critical consumer- and franchise/agent-facing websites. We may enter into other key outsourcing relationships in the future. If one or more of these external parties were not able to perform their functions for a period of time, perform them at an acceptable service level, or handle increased volumes, our business operations could be constrained, disrupted, or otherwise negatively affected. Our ability to monitor the activities or performance of vendors may be constrained, which makes it difficult for us to assess and manage the risks associated with these relationships.\nWe are relatively new to the mortgage brokerage industry, which, along with the intense competition within the industry, may hinder our efforts to establish and grow our new mortgage brokerage franchising business, Motto Mortgage, which could have implications to the goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe are pursuing a growth strategy to offer and sell residential mortgage brokerage franchises in the U.S under the \u201cMotto Mortgage\u201d brand and trademarks. We continue to develop operating experience in the mortgage brokerage industry. Our strategy hinges on our ability to recruit franchisees and help them recruit loan originators, to develop and maintain strong competencies within the mortgage brokerage market, on favorable conditions in the related regulatory environment and on our success in developing a strong, respected brand. We may fail to understand, interpret, implement and/or train franchisees adequately concerning compliance requirements related to the mortgage brokerage industry or the relationship between us and our franchisees, any of which failures could subject us or our franchisees to adverse actions from regulators. Motto Franchising, LLC, may also have regulatory obligations arising from its relationship with Motto franchisees; we may fail to comply with those obligations, and that failure could also subject us to adverse actions from regulators. The Motto Mortgage brand\u2019s lack of brand recognition may hamper franchise sales efforts. In addition, residential mortgage brokerage is a highly competitive industry and Motto will suffer if we are unable to attract franchisees, which will adversely affect Motto\u2019s growth, operations and profitability.\nWe have significant debt service obligations and may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nWe have significant debt service obligations, including principal, interest and commitment fee payments due quarterly pursuant to RE/MAX, LLC\u2019s Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our currently existing indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue additional equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Future indebtedness may impose additional restrictions on us, which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our Class A common stock.\nThe discontinuation of London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") may adversely affect our borrowing costs.\nThe variable interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facility can be based on LIBOR at our option, and we have chosen the LIBOR option on a regular basis. In 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate may cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past. The replacement with an alternative reference rate may cause unanticipated consequences and our future borrowing costs may be adversely affected. At this time, we are unable to predict what effect the discontinuance of LIBOR and the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on our borrowing costs and results of operations.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to home sales, and results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nHistorically, we have realized, and expect to continue to realize, lower Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue primarily as a result of lower overall home sale transactions, and higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with our RE/MAX annual convention. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, which would cause period to period comparisons of our operating results to not be necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future annual performance.\nExpectations of the Company relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs\nand expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance factors. Some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance. The criteria by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nRIHI has substantial influence over us including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and its interest in our business may conflict with yours.\nRIHI, a company controlled by David Liniger, our current Chairman and Co-Founder, and Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder, respectively, owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock. Although RIHI no longer controls a majority of the voting power of RE/MAX Holdings\u2019 common stock, RIHI remains a significant stockholder of the Company and through its ownership of the Class B common stock holds approximately 41.3% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s stock. Mr. Liniger also owns Class A common stock with an additional 1.2% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s stock. Therefore, RIHI has the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nIn addition, RIHI\u2019s entire economic interest in us is in the form of its direct interest in RMCO through the ownership of RMCO common units, the payments it may receive from us under its tax receivable agreement and the proceeds it may receive upon any redemption of its RMCO common units, including issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, upon any such redemption and any subsequent sale of such Class A common stock. As a result, RIHI\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of our Class A common stockholders. For example, RIHI may have a different tax position from us which could influence its decisions regarding certain transactions, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreements that we entered into in connection with our IPO, including whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreements and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, RIHI could have an interest in the structuring of future transactions to take into consideration its tax or other considerations, even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nOur tax receivable agreements require us to make cash payments based upon future tax benefits to which we may become entitled. The amounts that we may be required to pay could be significant, may be accelerated in certain circumstances and could significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into tax receivable agreements with our historical owners. After one of these historical owners assigned its interest in its tax receivable agreement, these tax receivable agreements are now held by RIHI and Parallaxes Rain Co-Investment, LLC (\u201cParallaxes\u201d and together, the \u201cTRA Parties\u201d). The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreements could be significant and will depend, in part, upon facts and circumstances that are beyond our control.\nThe tax receivable agreements provide that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, or that if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreements, then our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the tax receivable agreements would be\nbased on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements.\nAs a result, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Parties that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements, and (ii) if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreements early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the tax receivable agreements, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits.\nWe will also not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Parties (or their predecessors) pursuant to the tax receivable agreements if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to either of the TRA Parties will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the tax receivable agreements. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to either of the TRA Parties for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the tax receivable agreements that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe cannot assure you that we will have the available cash to make dividend payments.\nWe intend to continue to pay cash dividends quarterly. Whether we will do so, however, and the timing and amount of those dividends, will be subject to approval and declaration by our Board of Directors and will depend upon on a variety of factors, including our financial results, cash requirements and financial condition, our ability to pay dividends under our senior secured credit facility and any other applicable contracts, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Any dividends declared and paid will not be cumulative.\nBecause we are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of common units of RMCO, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of RMCO and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from RMCO. We expect to cause RMCO to make distributions to fund our expected dividend payments, subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in RMCO\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 current or future debt agreements.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u25cf provide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf delegate the sole power to a majority of our Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u25cf provide the power of our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on our Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u25cf eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition, except that David and Gail Liniger are deemed to have been approved by our Board of Directors, and thereby not subject to these restrictions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.", "PERMNO": 14221, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "RMAX"}
