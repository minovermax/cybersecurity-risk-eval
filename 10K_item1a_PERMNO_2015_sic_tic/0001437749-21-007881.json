Any of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSUMMARY\nThe following summarizes key risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect us. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks related to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, including, but not limited to, risks related to:\n\u2022\nthe issuance of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock as contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization;\n\u2022\ntrading in our securities during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nwhether the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization;\n\u2022\nclaims that may not be discharged in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity in connection with Medley LLC's bankruptcy petition;\n\u2022\npotential employee attrition and loss of investment contracts and/or counterparties as a result of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, including the termination of advisory agreements;

and\n\u2022\nour substantial indebtedness, our ability to pay our debts or raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nRisks related to our organizational structure, including, but not limited to, risks related to:\n\u2022\nMDLY\u2019s only material asset being its interest in Medley LLC and the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nMDLY being controlled by our pre-IPO owners;\n\u2022\nin certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits MDLY realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize anticipated cost savings and efficiencies from consolidating our business activities to our New York office; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of the termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the Amended MCC Merger Agreement on our business, financial results, ability to pay dividends and distributions, if any, to our stockholders, and our stock price.\nRisks related to our Class A Common Stock, including, but not limited to, risks related to:\n\u2022\npotential dilution by the future issuance of additional Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022\nthe disparity in the voting rights among the classes of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nour status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE\u2019s rules;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nthe volatility of the market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Related to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization\nOur consolidated subsidiary Medley LLC has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court, which is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with all bankruptcy cases.\nThe Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Medley LLC is conducting its business under Bankruptcy Court protection and operating as a debtor-in-possession, and MDLY is serving as co-plan sponsor in connection with the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. During the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, our management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with restructuring matters rather than focusing exclusively on our business operations. The Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case may also make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success of our business. In addition, during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, our clients, investors and/or strategic partners might lose confidence in Medley LLC\u2019s ability to reorganize its business successfully and may seek to establish alternative advisory and/or other relationships, renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationships with us and/or require financial assurances from us. If this occurs, clients, investors and/or strategic partners may lose confidence in our ability to provide them the level of service they expect, resulting in a significant decline in our fees, revenues, profitability, and related cash flow.\nOther significant risks include or relate to the following:\n\u2022\nthe effects of the filing of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case on our business and the interests of various constituents, including, but not limited to MDLY\u2019s Class A stockholders and the holders of Medley LLC\u2019s: (a) senior unsecured 2024 Notes with a maturity date of January 20, 2024, issued pursuant to that certain indenture agreement (as may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time) dated August 9, 2016, between Medley LLC, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d); and (b) senior unsecured 2026 Notes with a maturity date of August 15, 2026, issued pursuant to that certain indenture agreement (as may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time) dated August 9, 2016, between Medley LLC, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201c2026 Notes,\u201d and together with the 2024 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d or \"debt Instruments\");\n\u2022\nBankruptcy Court rulings in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, including with respect to Medley LLC\u2019s motions, third-party motions and any objections to the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, as well as the outcome of any other pending litigation;\n\u2022\nour ability to operate within the restrictions of bankruptcy protection and within the limitations of any orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nMedley LLC\u2019s existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control as debtor-in-possession during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nour ability to operate within our liquidity limitations, both during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and after implementation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization (which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, as to which no assurances can be given, and other conditions precedent), and our ability to obtain sufficient financing and access to capital to allow Medley LLC to emerge from bankruptcy protection and successfully execute our business plan post-emergence;\n\u2022\nincreased professional fees and advisory costs during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with restrictions on our ability to pursue some of our business strategies during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding the reactions of our clients, investors, strategic partners (and prospective clients, investors, strategic partners), service providers and other third parties, to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, and their respective willingness to maintain relationships, contractual or otherwise, with us;\nthe length of time that Medley LLC operates under Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case;\n\u2022\nMDLY\u2019s ability as co-plan sponsor and Medley LLC\u2019s ability as debtor to satisfy the conditions precedent to consummation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization;\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse effects of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe ultimate outcome of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case in general;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of a substantial number of shares of MDLY Class A common stock in connection with the proposed treatment of the Notes and claims held by Strategic Capital Advisory Services, LLC (the \"Strategic Capital Claims\"), in connection with the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, and the substantial dilution resulting therefrom;\n\u2022\nthe trading price and volatility of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock and Medley LLC\u2019s Notes, and the related ability to remain listed on the NYSE;\n\u2022\nthe potential material adverse effects of claims that are not discharged in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and under the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding our ability to retain and motivate key personnel; and\n\u2022\nuncertainties and continuing risks associated with our ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nFurther, under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business require the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events, to take advantage of certain opportunities, or adapt to changing market or industry conditions.\nWe are also subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could materially affect our business and operations in various ways and may significantly increase the duration and cost of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict, given that the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case may have on our corporate or capital structure. See the discussion appearing in in \u201cItem 1. - Business\u201d of this Form 10-K under the caption \u201cProposed Plan of Reorganization of Medley LLC\u201d for a description of the proposed Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, the consummation of which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and other conditions precedent.\nAs a result of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, realization of Medley LLC\u2019s assets and liquidation of its liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, Medley LLC may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in its consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result, the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements.\nCertain of the investment management agreements or partnership agreements provide for a termination right in the event of a bankruptcy filing by the general partner, investment manager, or one of their respective affiliates, as in the case of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. The Medley LLC Chapter 11 case could result in the termination of our investment advisory agreements. A termination of our investment advisory agreements could materially and adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of assets under management and a corresponding loss of revenue. However, provisions in contracts that allow for termination upon a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing or another type of insolvency event are generally invalid under the Bankruptcy Code as improper ipso facto clauses. If a party were to seek to terminate one of our management or partnership agreement that adversely impacted property of Medley LLC\u2019s estate, such party would likely have to file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief from the automatic stay and argue that the agreement should be terminated for reasons in addition to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Further, the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case could result in a change of control under the terms of our investment advisory agreements, in which such change of control may be deemed an assignment of such agreements. An assignment, actual or constructive, would trigger these termination and consent provisions and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, could materially and adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of assets under management and a corresponding loss of revenue.\nThe Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization contemplates the issuance of a substantial quantity of MDLY Class A common stock, which will result in substantial dilution to MDLY\u2019s Class A existing stockholders.\nThe Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and various conditions precedent, contemplates the issuance of a substantial number of shares of MDLY Class A Common Stock in connection with the proposed treatment of Medley LLC Notes and Strategic Capital Claims. In connection with the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, it is anticipated that certain equity incentive awards will also be issued to Medley personnel under the 2014 Plan, as amended. It is expected that the terms related to such awards will be set forth in a supplement to the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, with issuance of the awards subject to confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. See the discussion appearing in in \u201cItem 1. - Business\u201d of this Form 10-K under the caption \u201cProposed Plan of Reorganization of Medley LLC\u201d for a description of the proposed Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, the consummation of which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and other conditions precedent. The issuances of securities contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, including the proposed issuances of Class A common stock in connection with the treatment of noteholder claims and Strategic Capital claims, as well as any equity incentive awards issued to Medley personnel, is expected to result in substantial dilution to existing MDLY stockholders owning shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the value attributable to shares of MDLY\u2019s existing Class A common stock is expected to be materially affected by the reorganization of our capital structure through the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Any trading in shares of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock or the Notes during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of MDLY\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Medley LLC\u2019s Notes.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The market price for such securities has been, and may continue to be, volatile. While the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization contemplates that the Notes will be extinguished in exchange for MDLY Class A common stock, we can provide no assurances that Medley LLC will be able to maintain its listing on the NYSE prior to such exchange.\nTrading in our securities has been, and during the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case continues to be, highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The market price for our securities has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Under the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, it is contemplated that the Notes will be extinguished in exchange for shares of MDLY Class A common stock. See the discussion appearing in in \u201cItem 1. - Business\u201d of this Form 10-K under the caption \u201cProposed Plan of Reorganization of Medley LLC\u201d for a description of the proposed Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, the consummation of which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and other conditions precedent. While the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and implemented as contemplated will result in dilution to the existing holders of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization avoids a potentially value destructive change in control and enables the survival of the overall enterprise as a going concern, preserving and maximizing return and value for all stakeholders. However, if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is not approved, MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock and the Notes could potentially have no value. The Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization contemplates that the Notes will be extinguished in exchange for MDLY Class A common stock, in accordance with the terms of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, which is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and other conditions precedent. Therefore, we would expect that if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and becomes effective, the Notes would be cancelled in exchange for the recovery provided under the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, and the NYSE listing of the notes would cease at that time. However, we cannot provide any assurances that the NYSE would not delist the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes earlier. The NYSE has substantial discretion in discontinuing the listing of securities of issuers that have filed for reorganization relief under the bankruptcy laws, so we can provide no assurances that the listing of the Notes will be maintained during the period preceding any confirmation and effectiveness of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization.\nFurther, if Medley LLC does not have positive cash flow or is not in sound financial health, its securities could be delisted pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the \u201cManual\u201d) if the trading price of its securities on the NYSE is abnormally low, which has generally been interpreted to mean at levels below $0.16 per share, and its securities could also be delisted pursuant to Section 802.01 of the Manual if Medley LLC\u2019s average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 day-trading period is less than $15 million. In these events, Medley LLC would not have an opportunity to cure the market capitalization deficiency, and its securities would be delisted immediately and suspended from trading on the NYSE.\nThe NYSE has substantial discretion in discontinuing the listing of securities of issuers that have filed for reorganization relief under the bankruptcy laws, so we can provide no assurances that the listing of the Notes will be maintained during the period preceding any confirmation and effectiveness of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. If a suspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, its ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and attract and retain personnel by means of equity compensation, would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any suspended or delisted securities, Medley LLC would expect decreases in institutional and other investor demand, analyst coverage, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume, and fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such securities. A suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of Medley LLC\u2019s securities to investors and cause the trading volume of its securities to decline, which could result in a further decline in the market price of its securities.\nWe can provide no assurances that MDLY will be able to maintain its listing on the NYSE.\nMDLY\u2019s Class A Common Stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In order for our Class A Common Stock to continue to be listed on the NYSE, we are required to comply with various listing standards set forth in the Manual, including Section 802.01C, which requires the maintenance of a minimum average closing price of at least $1.00 per share during a consecutive 30 trading-day period (the \u201cMarket Capitalization Requirement\u201d). In addition to the Market Capitalization Requirement, we are considered to be below compliance if our average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 day-trading period is less than $50 million and, at the same time, our stockholders\u2019 equity is less than $50 million pursuant to Section 802.01B of the Manual (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Equity Requirement\u201d and, together with the Market Capitalization Requirement, the \u201cListing Requirements\u201d). We can provide no assurances that the listing of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock on the NYSE will be maintained in the future. As previously disclosed, on April 17, 2020, MDLY received written notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the NYSE that MDLY did not at the time of the Notice (nor does MDLY at the time of filing of this Form 10-K) satisfy the Listing Requirements set forth in the Manual\nAs noted in the Notice, as of April 16, 2020, MDLY\u2019s 30 trading-day average global market capitalization was approximately $26.5 million and its stockholders\u2019 equity was approximately ($118.1) million as of December 31, 2019. On June 1, 2020, MDLY submitted a business plan to the NYSE reflecting MDLY\u2019s intent to seek to regain compliance with the Listing Standards. On July 27, 2020, the NYSE accepted the plan and extended the cure period from December 26, 2020 to December 26, 2021, with MDLY subject to ongoing quarterly monitoring for compliance with said plan. However, MDLY can provide no assurances that it will be able to satisfy any of the steps outlined above and maintain the listing of the MDLY Class A common stock on the NYSE, or that MDLY\u2019s continuing noncompliance with the Listing Standards or the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case will not materially adversely affect or prevent the continued listing of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock in the future. Any suspension of trading or delisting of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock from the NYSE would have a material adverse effect on holders of shares of MDLY\u2019s Class A common stock (including on holders who would receive such shares as contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization), and on the liquidity of such shares and the ability to trade and sell such shares, and could materially adversely affect the market price of the MDLY Class A common stock.\nThe commencement of suspension or delisting procedures by an exchange remains, at all times, at the discretion of such exchange and would be publicly announced by the exchange. If a suspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, MDLY\u2019s ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and attract and retain personnel by means of equity compensation, would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any suspended or delisted securities, MDLY would expect decreases in institutional and other investor demand, analyst coverage, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume, and fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such securities. A suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of shares of MDLY\u2019s Class A Common Stock to investors and cause the trading volume of the Class A Common Stock to decline, which could result in a further decline in the market price of such Class A Common Stock.\nWe may not be able to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization or may have to materially modify the terms of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization.\nEven if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote (a \u201cVoting Class\u201d), the Bankruptcy Court, which, as a court of equity, may exercise substantial discretion and may choose not to confirm the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code requirements include, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization of Medley LLC (the feasibility requirement), and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if Medley LLC liquidated under Chapter 7 (as defined below). Although we believe that the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court or other parties in interest will reach the same conclusion. Confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will also be subject to certain conditions precedent. These conditions may not be met and there can be no assurance that the consenting stakeholders will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate material changes to the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Any such modifications could result in material less favorable treatment than the treatment currently anticipated to be included in the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property to the class affected by the modification of a materially lesser value than currently anticipated to be included in the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Changes to the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization may also delay the confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization and Medley LLC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in, among other things, additional incurred costs and expenses to Medley LLC\u2019s estate as debtor in bankruptcy.\nThe Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization may not become effective.\nEven if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that such conditions precedent will be satisfied and thus no assurance that the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will become effective and that Medley LLC will emerge from the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case as contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. If the Chapter 11 process takes longer than anticipated and Medley LLC remains in bankruptcy protection longer than expected, and the effective date of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is delayed, MDLY and Medley LLC may not have sufficient cash available to operate our business. In that case, we may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the cost of consummating the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. There can be no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available at all. If the transactions contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, potentially in a material fashion. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in materially different treatment for stakeholders, material additional expense and material delays to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case.\nThe Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us, with the assistance of our financial advisor/investment banker. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nThe Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our business and reflects assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization relies upon financial projections developed by us with the assistance of our financial advisor/investment banker, including with respect to fees, revenues, debt service, and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (1) our ability to substantially change our capital structure, (2) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources, (3) our ability to maintain clients\u2019, investors\u2019 and strategic partners\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing enterprise and to attract and retain sufficient business from and partnership endeavors with them, (4) our ability to retain key employees and (5) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the markets in which we operate. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, even if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and implemented by us, will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization.\nEven if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we may continue to face a number of risks that are beyond our control, such as changes in economic conditions, changes in the financial markets, investment values or industry in general, changes in demand for our services and increasing expenses. Some of these risks typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period of time without indication of how or when the transactions under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will close. As a result of these and other risks, we cannot guarantee that the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will achieve our stated goals. Furthermore, even if Medley LLC\u2019s debts are reduced or discharged through the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, Medley LLC, MDLY and/or our affiliates may need to raise additional funds through one or more public or private debt or equity financings or other means to fund our business after the completion of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. Our access to additional capital may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. As a result, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization may not become effective and, thus, we cannot assure you of our ability to continue as a going concern, even if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is confirmed. Further, because our investment management agreements are terminable at will, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization may result in the termination of such agreements which would further adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund our ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs throughout the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. We cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case; further, if such cash sources proved insufficient, we can provide no assurances that we would be able to secure additional interim financing or adequate exit financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs (or if sufficient funds are available, that they would be offered to us on acceptable terms). Our liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, depends on, among other things: (1) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of the orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, (2) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (3) our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, (4) to the extent necessary, our ability to access credit, (5) our ability to consummate the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, and (6) the overall cost, duration and outcome of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case.\nIn certain limited instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert a chapter 11 bankruptcy case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 7\u201d). In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate Medley LLC\u2019s assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in materially smaller distributions being made to Medley LLC\u2019s creditors than those provided for in a plan of reorganization because of: (1) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern; (2) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee; and (3) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations (which would include, in the context of a Chapter 7 case, the likely termination of our investment advisory contracts).\nThe audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 contain disclosures that express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments that might result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern. Such assumption may not be justified. Our liquidity has been negatively impacted by declines in fee earning AUM and our substantial indebtedness and associated debt-related expenses. As a result of these and other factors, we commenced the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. The Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization contemplates a reorganization involving, among other things, the issuance of shares of MDLY Class A common stock in connection with the treatment of holders of Notes claims; however, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and other conditions precedent. The inclusion in our financial statements of disclosures that express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may negatively impact the trading price of our securities and have an adverse impact on our relationships with third parties with whom we do business, including our clients, investors and strategic partners (and prospective clients, investors and strategic partners), and other third parties, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the aforementioned parties respective willingness to maintain relationships, contractual or otherwise, with us.\nAs a result of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, which may be volatile.\nDuring the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the Petition Date. In addition, as described in this Form 10-K, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization (which is subject to Bankruptcy Court approval and other conditions precedent), contemplates that our capital structure will be significantly altered, that Medley LLC\u2019s 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes will be extinguished, and that a significant amount of MDLY Class A common stock will be issued in connection therewith, resulting in substantial dilution to MDLY\u2019s existing stockholders. Even if the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the form as proposed, or if such plan is approved with significant amendments, or if an alternative plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, we would expect that our existing capital structure would be fundamentally altered. If Medley LLC emerges from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to our historical consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from, among other things, substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims against Medley LLC that arose prior to the Petition Date or before consummation of a plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under a plan of reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of a plan of reorganization. Subject to the terms of a plan of reorganization and orders of the Bankruptcy Court, any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to a plan of reorganization could be asserted against Medley LLC and may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nIf Medley LLC operates under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s protection for a long period of time, or for a longer period of time than expected, our business may be harmed.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. Medley LLC\u2019s being subject to a long period of operations under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case continue, the more likely it is that our clients, investors, strategic partners and service providers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and seek to establish alternative advisory and/or other commercial relationships, as applicable. Furthermore, so long as the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case continues, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11 protection.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote a positive image after emergence from the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case.\nThe Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case limits the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile Medley LLC operates its business as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with the various other parties-in-interest and one or more hearings. Other parties-in-interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process may delay major transactions and limit our ability to respond quickly to opportunities and events. In addition to constraints on Medley LLC\u2019s activities as debtor-in-possession, MDLY\u2019s role as co-plan sponsor in connection with the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization may place limitations and restrictions on MDLY\u2019s business activities and resources. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe are beneficial to us.\nWe may experience employee attrition as a result of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case.\nAs a result of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, we may experience employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case is limited by certain restrictions on the implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our business strategies and implement operational initiatives, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nDifficult market and political conditions may adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to our taxation, taxation of our investors, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on asset managers), trade barriers including tariffs, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations). These factors are outside of our control and may affect the level and volatility of asset prices and the liquidity and value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions.\nFor example, between 2008 and 2009, the U.S. and global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by periodic disruptions in liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market, and the failure of major financial institutions. Despite actions of the U.S. federal government and foreign governments, these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular.\nMore recently, global financial markets have experienced heightened volatility, including due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and \u201cBrexit\u201d in the United Kingdom and the continued uncertainty regarding the terms of the exit as further described herein, as well as the results of the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential and 2016 and 2018 congressional elections and resulting uncertainty regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies, and concerns over increasing interest rates (particularly short-term rates), uncertainty regarding the short- and long-term effects of tax reform in the United States and uncertainty regarding trade policies and tariffs. Further, the commencement, continuation, or cessation of government and central bank policies and economic stimulus programs, including changes in monetary policy involving interest rate adjustments or governmental policies, may contribute to the development of or result in an increase in market volatility, illiquidity and other adverse effects that could negatively impact the global financial markets and us. Any of the foregoing (or related events or effects thereof or similar unpredictable events or uncertainties in global market or political conditions) could have a significant impact on the markets in which we operate and a material adverse impact on our business prospects and financial condition.\nA number of factors have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on credit markets. We may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates due to the current period of historically low interest rates. Expectations of higher inflation generally cause interest rates to rise. Changes in and uncertainty surrounding interest rates may have a material effect on our business, particularly with respect to the cost and availability of financing for significant acquisition and disposition transactions. Furthermore, some of the provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the United States, Public Law No. 115-97 (the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) could have a negative impact on the cost of financing and dampen the attractiveness of credit. There has been a corresponding meaningful increase in the uncertainty surrounding interest rates, foreign exchange rates, trade volume, and fiscal and economic policies, which has heightened volatility in the U.S. and global markets and could persist for an extended period. With the current Biden administration, a Democratic controlled Congress, and changes in leadership at federal agencies, we expect that financial institutions will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices. The ultimate impact of current or future legislation on our businesses and results of operations, will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions\nThese and other conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy may result in adverse consequences for our funds and their respective investee companies, which could restrict such funds\u2019 investment activities and impede such funds\u2019 ability to effectively achieve their investment objectives. In addition, because the fees we earn under our investment management agreements are based in part on the market value of our AUM and in part on investment performance, if any of these factors cause a decline in our AUM or result in non-performance of loans by investee companies, it would result in lower fees earned, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus pandemic.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, there is an outbreak of COVID-19, a novel and highly contagious form of coronavirus, which the World Health Organization has declared to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous deaths, adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in certain equity and debt markets. The global impact of the pandemic is rapidly evolving, and many countries have reacted by instituting quarantines, prohibitions on travel and the closure of offices, businesses, schools, retail stores and other public venues. Businesses are also implementing similar precautionary measures. Such measures, as well as the general uncertainty surrounding the dangers and impact of COVID-19, are creating significant disruption in supply chains and economic activity and are having a particularly adverse impact on transportation, hospitality, tourism, entertainment and other industries. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the potential impacts, including a global, regional or other economic recession, are increasingly uncertain and difficult to assess.\nDuring 2020, U.S. credit and equity markets exhibited volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic is materially and adversely affecting our financial condition, operating results and cash flows and the operations and financial performance of our funds, and we expect the adverse impacts will continue in the future. Specifically, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has:\n\u2022\nfactored into in the termination of the proposed merger with Sierra;\n\u2022\nresulted in the decrease of year-over-year loan issuances;\n\u2022\naffected the Company\u2019s ability to pay its indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nresulted in a general decline in business activity which if continued will result in a decline in demand for financing, which could adversely affect our liquidity, as management fees may be impacted by potential declines or downward adjustments to valuations, and our ability to fundraise in the future.\nAny public health emergency, including any future outbreak of COVID-19, SARS, H1N1/09 flu, avian flu, other coronavirus, Ebola or other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, could have a significant adverse impact on the Company and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill its investment objectives.\nThe extent of the impact of any public health emergency on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of such public health emergency, the extent of any related travel advisories and restrictions implemented, the impact of such public health emergency on overall supply and demand, goods and services, investor liquidity, consumer confidence and levels of economic activity and the extent of its disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The effects of a public health emergency may materially and adversely impact the value and performance of the Company\u2019s investments, the Company\u2019s ability to source, manage and divest investments and the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its investment objectives, all of which could result in significant losses to the Company. In addition, the operations of the Company may be significantly impacted, or even temporarily or permanently halted, as a result of government quarantine measures, voluntary and precautionary restrictions on travel or meetings and other factors related to a public health emergency, including its potential adverse impact on the health of any such entity\u2019s personnel.\nFurther, significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. Thus, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell our investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\nWe also face an increased risk of investor, creditor or portfolio company disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and the implications thereof on United Kingdom, European and global macroeconomics conditions could adversely affect our business.\nThe United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) left the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). During an 11 month transition period, the UK and the EU agreed to a Trade and Cooperation Agreement which sets out the agreement for certain parts of the future relationship between the EU and the UK from January 1, 2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not provide the UK with the same level of rights or access to all goods and services in the EU as the UK previously maintained as a member of the EU and during the transition period. In particular the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include an agreement on financial services which is yet to be agreed. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in certain areas as to the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\nFrom January 1, 2021, EU laws ceased to apply in the UK. However, many EU laws have been transposed into English law and these transposed laws will continue to apply until such time that they are repealed, replaced or amended. Depending on the terms of any future agreement between the EU and the UK on financial services, substantial amendments to English law may occur, and it is impossible to predict the consequences on our funds, their investments, and our business. Such changes could be materially detrimental to investors.\nAlthough one cannot predict the full effect of Brexit, it could have a significant adverse impact on the UK, European and global macroeconomic conditions and could lead to prolonged political, legal, regulatory, tax and economic uncertainty. This uncertainty is likely to continue to impact the global economic climate and may impact opportunities, pricing, availability and cost of bank financing, regulation, values or exit opportunities of companies or assets based, doing business, or having service or other significant relationships in, the UK or the EU, which may negatively impact our business, including companies or assets held or considered for prospective investment by our funds.\nThe future application of EU-based legislation to the private fund industry in the UK and the EU will ultimately depend on how the UK renegotiates the regulation of the provision of financial services within and to persons in the EU. There can be no assurance that any renegotiated terms or regulations will not have an adverse impact on our funds, their investments or our business, including the ability of our funds to achieve their investment objectives. Brexit may result in significant market dislocation, heightened counterparty risk, an adverse effect on the management of market risk and, in particular, asset and liability management due in part to redenomination of financial assets and liabilities, an adverse effect on our ability, and the ability of our affiliates to manage, operate and invest in our funds and increased legal, regulatory or compliance burden for us, our affiliates and/or our funds, each of which may have a negative impact on the operations, financial condition, returns or prospects of our funds, which may have a negative impact on our business.\nAreas where the uncertainty created by the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU is relevant include, but are not limited to, trade within Europe, foreign direct investment in Europe, the scope and functioning of European regulatory frameworks (including with respect to the regulation of alternative investment fund managers and the distribution and marketing of alternative investment funds), industrial policy pursued within European countries, immigration policy pursued within EU countries, the regulation of the provision of financial services within and to persons in Europe and trade policy within European countries and internationally. The volatility and uncertainty caused by the withdrawal may adversely affect the value of our funds\u2019 investments and the ability to achieve the investment objective of our funds, as well as the investment objectives of our business.\nNew legislation or tax-reform policies that would change U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities, including uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax or regulations and future changes in the U.S. taxation of businesses may impact our effective tax rate or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changed the Code, including a reduction in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate to 21%, a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and dramatic changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued. It is possible that U.S. tax law will be modified by the new Biden administration by increasing corporate tax rates, eliminating, or modifying some of the provisions enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs or other changes that could have an adverse effect on us and contribute to overall market volatility. The Biden administration has indicated that it intends to modify key aspects of the tax code, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Although we attempt to comply with all taxing authority regulations, adverse findings or assessments made by taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires complex computations not previously provided in U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items remain uncertain. Further, compliance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the accounting for such provisions requires an accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, and as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, our effective tax rate could be materially different. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, regulations, or other guidance issued under it (including additional technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance yet to be issued) or conforming or non-conforming state tax rules might affect us or our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that U.S. tax laws, including the corporate income tax rate, would not undergo significant changes in the near future.\nRising interest rates may adversely affect the value of our portfolio investments which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt investments may be based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our shares and our rate of return on invested capital. A reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could also have an adverse impact on our net interest income. An increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments our funds hold which earn fixed interest rates, including subordinated loans, senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans and high yield bonds, and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make investment in our funds if such funds are not able to increase our distribution rate, which could reduce the value of the funds\u2019 securities.\nBecause our funds may borrow funds and may issue preferred shares to finance investments, such funds\u2019 net investment income may depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which such funds borrow funds or pay distributions on preferred shares and the rate that the funds\u2019 investments yield. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, the cost of funds would increase except to the extent our funds have issued fixed rate debt or preferred shares, which could reduce our net investment income.\nA change in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to a change in the interest rate our funds receive on our debt investments. Accordingly, a change in the interest rate could make it easier for our funds to meet or exceed the performance threshold and may result in a substantial increase in the amount of incentive fees payable to us with respect to the portion of the incentive fee based on income.\nIn addition, the occurrence of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Any such unfavorable economic conditions, including rising interest rates, may also increase our funding costs, limit our access to capital markets or negatively impact our ability to obtain financing, particularly from the debt markets. In addition, any future financial market uncertainty could lead to financial market disruptions and could further impact our ability to obtain financing. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from SIC, which is managed pursuant to an advisory agreement that may be terminated or a fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to remove us as the general partner.\nWith respect to our permanent capital vehicle, SIC's investment management agreement must be approved annually by its board of directors or by the vote of a majority of the stockholders and the majority of the independent members of its board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. In addition, as required by the Investment Company Act, SIC has the right to terminate its management agreement without penalty upon 60 days\u2019 written notice to its adviser and the agreement terminates automatically in the event of an \u201cassignment\u201d as defined under the Investment Company Act. Further, such agreement may be terminated as a result of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. Termination of this agreement would reduce the fees we earn from SIC, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our investment advisory relationship with SIC represented approximately 46.6%, 43.6% and 40.4%, respectively, of our total management fees. This investment advisory relationships also represented, in the aggregate, 25.0% of our AUM at December 31, 2020. There can be no assurance that our investment management agreement with respect to SIC will remain in place.\nWith respect to our long-dated private funds, insofar as we control the general partner of such funds, the risk of termination of the investment management agreement for such funds is limited, subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties as general partner. However, the applicable fund partnership agreements may permit the limited partners of each respective fund to remove us as general partner by a majority or, in certain circumstances, a super majority vote. In addition, the partnership agreements provide for dissolution of the partnership upon certain changes of control.\nOur SMAs are governed by investment management agreements that may be terminated by investors at any time for cause under the applicable agreement and \u201ccause\u201d may include the departure of specified members of our senior management team. Absent cause, the investment management agreements that govern our SMAs are generally not terminable during the specified investment period or following the specified investment period, prior to the scheduled maturities or disposition of the subject AUM.\nIn addition, certain of the investment management agreements or partnership agreements provide for a termination right in the event of a bankruptcy filing by the general partner, investment manager, or one of their respective affiliates, as in the case of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case. However, provisions in contracts that allow for termination upon a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing or another type of insolvency event are generally invalid under the Bankruptcy Code as improper ipso facto clauses. If a party were to seek to terminate one of our management or partnership agreement that adversely impacted property of Medley LLC\u2019s estate, such party would likely have to file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief from the automatic stay and argue that the agreement should be terminated for reasons in addition to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\nTermination of these agreements would negatively affect the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of an SEC investigation.\nWe are cooperating with an SEC investigation as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of this matter, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of, or the timeframe for, the conclusion of this investigation. An adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees. Although our investment management fees vary among and within asset classes, historically we have competed primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In September 2009, the Institutional Limited Partners Association published a set of Private Equity Principles (the \u201cPrinciples\u201d), which were revised in January 2011. The Principles were developed to encourage discussion between limited partners and general partners regarding private equity fund partnership terms. Certain of the Principles call for enhanced \u201calignment of interests\u201d between general partners and limited partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements, including proposed guidelines for fees and performance income structures. Although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees with respect to our existing funds, we may experience pressure to do so in our funds. More recently institutional investors have been allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies as well as attempting to reduce management and investment fees to external managers, whether through direct reductions, deferrals or rebates. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations. For more information about our fees, see \u201cBusiness - Fee Structure.\"\nA change of control of us could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements.\nPursuant to the Investment Company Act, the investment advisory agreement for SIC, the BDC we advise, automatically terminates upon its deemed \u201cassignment\u201d and a BDC\u2019s board and shareholders must approve a new agreement in order for us to continue to act as its investment adviser. In addition, pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act, each of our investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be \u201cassigned\u201d without the consent of the client. A sale of a controlling block of our voting securities and certain other transactions would be deemed an \u201cassignment\u201d pursuant to both the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act. If such a deemed assignment occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from clients whose funds are managed pursuant to separate accounts or the necessary approvals from the board and shareholders of SIC, the SEC-registered BDC that we advise. An assignment, actual or constructive, would trigger these termination and consent provisions and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, could materially and adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of assets under management and a corresponding loss of revenue.\nThe historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our Class A Common Stock.\nThe historical performance of our funds is relevant to us primarily insofar as it is indicative of fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future and our reputation and ability to raise new funds. The historical and potential returns of the funds we advise are not, however, directly linked to returns on our Class A Common Stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that positive performance of the funds we advise will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in Class A Common Stock. However, poor performance of the funds we advise could cause a decline in our revenues and could therefore have a negative effect on our operating results and returns on our Class A Common Stock. An investment in our Class A Common Stock is not an investment in any of our funds. Also, there is no assurance that projections in respect of our funds or unrealized valuations will be realized.\nMoreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of these funds or from any future funds we may raise, in part because:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than the market conditions we may experience in the future;\n\u2022\nour funds\u2019 rates of returns, which are calculated on the basis of NAV of the funds\u2019 investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u2022\nour funds\u2019 returns have previously benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not recur, and our funds may not be able to achieve the same returns or profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;\n\u2022\nthe historical returns that we present in this Form 10-K derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed, which may have little or no realized investment track record;\n\u2022\nyou will not benefit from any value that was created in our funds prior to our becoming a public company if such value was previously realized;\n\u2022\nin recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in alternative funds and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future; and\n\u2022\nour newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital.\nThe future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described in this Form 10-K, including risks of the industries and business in which a particular fund invests.\nIf we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.\nOur growth strategy may include the selective development or acquisition of other asset management businesses, advisory businesses or other businesses or financial products complementary to our business where we think we can add substantial value or generate substantial returns. The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays, (e) our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners and (f) our ability to properly manage conflicts of interest. Moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully complete an acquisition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new business or activities. If we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, our business, results of operations and the market price for our Class A common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party distribution sources to market our investment strategies.\nOur ability to grow our AUM, particularly with respect to our BDC, is dependent on access to third-party intermediaries, including investment banks, broker dealers and RIAs. We cannot assure you that these intermediaries will continue to be accessible to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, pension fund consultants may review and evaluate our institutional products and our firm from time to time. Poor reviews or evaluations of either a particular product, or of us, may result in institutional client withdrawals or may impair our ability to attract new assets through these consultants.\nAn investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.\nOur funds have historically invested primarily in privately held companies. Investments in private companies pose certain incremental risks as compared to investments in public companies including that private companies:\n\u2022\nhave reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress;\n\u2022\nmay have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under debt that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;\n\u2022\nmay have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger business, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors\u2019 actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;\n\u2022\nare more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our investee company and, in turn, on us; and\n\u2022\ngenerally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing business with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. In addition, our executive officers, directors or employees may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our funds\u2019 investments in investee companies.\nFinally, limited public information generally exists about private companies and these companies may not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of our funds\u2019 advisors to obtain adequate information through due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness and potential returns from investing in these companies. Additionally, these companies and their financial information will not generally be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, our funds may lose money on such investments.\nOur funds\u2019 investments in investee companies may be risky, and our funds could lose all or part of their investments.\nOur funds pursue strategies focused on investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies.\nSenior Secured Debt and Second Lien Secured Debt. When our funds invest in senior secured term debt and second lien secured debt, our funds will generally take a security interest in the available assets of these investee companies, including the equity interests of their subsidiaries. There is a risk that the collateral securing such investments may decrease in value over time or lose its entire value, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the investee company to raise additional capital. Also, in some circumstances, our security interest could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in an investee company\u2019s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the debt. Consequently, the fact that debt is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the investment terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the investment should we be forced to enforce our remedies.\nSenior Unsecured Debt. Our funds may also make unsecured debt investments in investee companies, meaning that such investments will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies.\nSubordinated Debt. Our subordinated debt investments will generally be subordinated to senior debt and will generally be unsecured. This may result in a heightened level of risk and volatility or a loss of principal, which could lead to the loss of the entire investment. These investments may involve additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. To the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt may be subject to greater fluctuations in valuations, and such debt could subject our funds to non-cash income. Since the applicable fund would not receive any principal repayments prior to the maturity of some of our subordinated debt investments, such investments will be of greater risk than amortizing loans.\nEquity Investments. Certain of our funds make selected equity investments. In addition, when our funds invest in senior and subordinated debt, they may acquire warrants or options to purchase equity securities or benefit from other types of equity participation. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of these equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests our funds receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, our funds may not be able to realize gains from such equity interests, and any gains that our funds do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses our funds experience.\nMost loans in which our funds invest will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would be rated as below investment grade quality. Loans rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. From time to time, our funds, in the past, and may in the future, lose some or all of their investment in an investee company.\nPrepayments of debt investments by our investee companies could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that the investments our funds make in investee companies may be repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, our BDC will generally use such proceeds to reduce its existing borrowings and our private funds will generally return such capital to its investors, which capital may be recalled at a later date pursuant to such funds' governing documents. With respect to our SMAs, if such event occurs after the investment period, such capital will be returned to investors. Any future investment in a new investee company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, the results of operations of the affected fund could be materially adversely affected if one or more investee companies elect to prepay amounts owed to such fund, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur funds\u2019 investee companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our funds\u2019 investments in such companies.\nOur funds pursue a strategy focused on investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies. Our funds\u2019 investee companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which our funds invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which our funds invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of an investee company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our funds\u2019 investment in that investee company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such investee company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to our funds. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which our funds invest, our funds would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant investee company.\nSubordinated liens on collateral securing loans that our funds make to their investee companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and our funds.\nCertain debt investments that our funds make in investee companies are secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior secured debt of such companies. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the investee company\u2019s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the company under the agreements governing the debt. The holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before our funds. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens, then our funds, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the investee company\u2019s remaining assets, if any.\nOur funds may also make unsecured debt investments in investee companies, meaning that such investments will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on such investee companies\u2019 collateral, if any, will secure the investee company\u2019s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the investee company under its secured debt agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured debt obligations after payment in full of all secured debt obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured debt obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors\u2019 claims against the investee company\u2019s remaining assets, if any.\nThe rights our funds may have with respect to the collateral securing the debt investments our funds make in their investee companies with senior debt outstanding may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that our funds enter into with the holders of senior secured debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the discretion of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. Our funds may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if their rights are adversely affected.\nThere may be circumstances where our funds\u2019 debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or our funds could be subject to lender liability claims.\nIf one of our investee companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which our funds actually provided managerial assistance to that investee company or a representative of us sat on the board of directors of such investee company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our funds\u2019 debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our funds\u2019 claim to that of other creditors. In situations where a bankruptcy carries a high degree of political significance, our funds\u2019 legal rights may be subordinated to other creditors.\nIn addition, lenders in certain cases can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them when they become too involved in the borrower\u2019s business or exercise control over a borrower. It is possible that we or our funds could become subject to a lender\u2019s liability claim, including as a result of actions taken if we or our funds render significant managerial assistance to, or exercise control or influence over the board of directors of, the borrower.\nOur funds may not have the resources or ability to make additional investments in our investee companies.\nAfter an initial investment in an investee company, our funds may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to such company or have the opportunity to increase their investment through the exercise of a warrant or other right to purchase common stock. There is no assurance that the applicable fund will make, or will have sufficient resources to make, follow-on investments. Even if such fund has sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our level of risk, we prefer other opportunities or we are limited in our ability to do so by compliance with BDC requirements or maintaining RIC status, if applicable. Any decisions not to make a follow-on investment or any inability on our part to make such an investment may have a negative impact on an investee company in need of such an investment, may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation or may reduce the expected return on the investment.\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our investee companies and harm our operating results.\nMany of our investee companies are susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our funds\u2019 debt investments during these periods. Therefore, our funds\u2019 non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value of our funds\u2019 portfolios are likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of any collateral securing our senior secured or second lien secured debt. A severe recession may further decrease the value of such collateral and result in losses of value in such portfolios. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us on terms we deem acceptable. Occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Any such unfavorable economic conditions, including rising interest rates, may also increase our funding costs, limit our access to capital markets or negatively impact our ability to obtain financing, particularly from the debt markets. In addition, any future financial market uncertainty could lead to financial market disruptions and could further impact our ability to obtain financing. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nA covenant breach by our investee companies may harm our operating results.\nAn investee company\u2019s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its debt and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize an investee company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity instruments that our funds hold. Our funds may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting investee company. To the extent our funds incur additional costs and/or do not recover their investments in investee companies, we may earn reduced management and incentive fees, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe investment management business is competitive.\nThe investment management business is competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. We compete for investors with a number of other investment managers, public and private funds, BDCs, small business investment companies and others. Numerous factors increase our competitive risks, including:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nsome of our funds may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u2022\nseveral of our competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our funds;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain business or investments than we do and/or bear less compliance expense than we do;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have more flexibility than we have in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do; and\n\u2022\nother industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.\nIn addition, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions and recent developments with the business, including the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case\n. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur funds operate in a competitive market for lending that has recently intensified, and competition may limit our funds\u2019 ability to originate or acquire desirable loans and investments and could also affect the yields of these assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur funds operate in a competitive market for lending that has recently intensified. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our funds\u2019 ability to originate or acquire credit investments on attractive terms. In originating or acquiring our target credit investments, we compete with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, BDCs, small business investment companies, REITs, commercial finance and insurance companies and others. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. government. Many of our competitors or their funds are not subject to the operating constraints associated with qualifying as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code or compliance with the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, offer more attractive pricing, transaction structures, covenants or other terms and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for investments in our target assets may lead to the yields of such assets decreasing, which may further limit our ability to generate satisfactory returns. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable loans and investments may be limited in the future and our funds may not be able to take advantage of attractive lending and investment opportunities from time to time, thereby limiting their ability to identify and originate loans or make investments that are consistent with their investment objectives. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures our funds face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDependence on leverage by SIC and by our funds\u2019 investee companies subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nSIC and our funds\u2019 investee companies rely on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. While our permanent capital vehicle, SIC, is our only fund that currently relies on the use of leverage, certain of our other funds may in the future rely on the use of leverage. If our funds or the companies in which our funds invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to business generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Any economic downturn could materially and adversely affect the financial resources of our funds and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. Finally, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance our funds\u2019 investments are generally deductible expenses for income tax purposes, subject to limitations under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, as has been discussed from time to time in various jurisdictions, would reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nSimilarly, our funds\u2019 investee companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets to obtain additional financing for their operations. Our investee companies are typically highly leveraged. Those that have credit ratings are typically non-investment grade and those that do not have credit ratings would likely be non-investment grade if they were rated. If the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those investee companies and, therefore, the investment returns of our funds. In addition, if the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our investee companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs. As of December 31, 2020, SIC had a NAV of $525.7 million, $0.7 billion of AUM and an asset coverage ratio of 462.6%. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss to investors. A fund may borrow money from time to time to make investments or may enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by returns on such investments and may be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such investments. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund\u2019s NAV to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund\u2019s NAV could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. In addition, as a BDC registered under the Investment Company Act, SIC is permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage ratio equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. SIC\u2019s ability to pay dividends will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below at least 200% and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our funds make. In addition, a default could result in a rise of interest rates and negatively affect our tax valuations. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our funds may invest in companies that are highly leveraged, which may increase the risk of loss associated with those investments.\nSome of our funds may invest in companies whose capital structures involve significant leverage. For example, in many non-distressed private equity investments, indebtedness may be as much as 75% or more of an investee company\u2019s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, whether incurred at or above the investment-level entity. In distressed situations, indebtedness may exceed 100% or more of an investee company\u2019s capitalization. Additionally, the debt positions originated or acquired by our funds may be the most junior in what could be a complex capital structure, and thus subject us to the greatest risk of loss.\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.\nFurthermore, the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u2022\nsubject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our funds\u2019 ability to realize value from the investment;\n\u2022\nallow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of our funds\u2019 equity investment in it;\n\u2022\ngive rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity\u2019s ability to respond to changing industry conditions if additional cash is needed for the response or to take advantage of growth opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for working capital or other general corporate purposes.\nAs a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. For example, a number of investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flows precipitated by the subsequent economic downturn during 2008 and 2009.\nWe generally do not control the business operations of our investee companies and, due to the illiquid nature of our investments, may not be able to dispose of such investments.\nInvestments by our funds generally consist of debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. We do not expect to control most of our investee companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights, and our debt agreements may impose certain restrictive covenants on our borrowers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that an investee company in which our funds invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. Due to the lack of liquidity for our investments in private companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our investee companies as readily as we would like or at an appropriate valuation. As a result, an investee company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment holdings.\nA substantial portion of our investments may be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our respective funds\u2019 boards of directors or similar bodies and, as a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the value of our funds\u2019 investments.\nThe debt and equity instruments in which our funds invest for which market quotations are not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of such respective funds' boards of directors or similar bodies. Most, if not all, of our funds' investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) are classified as Level III under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This means that our funds\u2019 portfolio valuations will be based on unobservable inputs and our funds\u2019 assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. We expect that inputs into the determination of fair value of our funds\u2019 portfolio investments will require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data were available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimers materially reduces the reliability of such information. Our funds retain the services of an independent service provider to review the valuation of these loans and securities.\nThe types of factors that the board of directors, general partner or similar body may take into account in determining the fair value of a fund\u2019s investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly traded securities including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of an investee company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the investee company\u2019s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the investee company does business and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these loans and securities existed. Our funds\u2019 NAV could be materially and adversely affected if determinations regarding the fair value of such funds\u2019 investments were materially higher than the values that such funds\u2019 ultimately realize upon the disposal of such loans and securities.\nWe may need to pay \u201cclawback\u201d obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with respect to certain of our funds and SMAs.\nGenerally, if at the termination of a fund (and sometimes at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. These repayment obligations may correspond to amounts previously distributed to our senior professionals prior to our IPO, with respect to which our holders of Class A Common Stock did not receive any benefit. This obligation is known as a \u201cclawback\u201d obligation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received carried interest distributions aggregating $0.6 million from one of its managed funds which was fully liquidated as of December 31, 2020. In addition to the receipt of these distributions, the Company received a carried interest distribution of $0.3 million from one of its managed funds, which was fully liquidated as of December 31, 2019. Prior to the receipt of these distributions, Medley has not received any carried interest, other than tax distributions, a portion of which is subject to clawback. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a $7.2 million clawback obligation that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Had we assumed all existing investments were worthless as of December 31, 2020, there would be no additional amounts subject to clawback.\nAlthough a clawback obligation is several to each person who received a distribution, and not a joint obligation, the governing agreements of our funds generally provide that, if a recipient does not fund his or her respective share, we may have to fund such additional amounts beyond the amount of carried interest we retained, although we generally will retain the right to pursue remedies against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We may need to use or reserve cash to repay such clawback obligations instead of using the cash for other purposes. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contingent Obligations.\u201d\nOur funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWhile diversification is generally an objective of our funds, there can be no assurance as to the degree of diversification, if any, that will be achieved in any fund investments. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a fund if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. This lack of diversification may expose a fund to losses disproportionate to economic conditions or market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse movements in the particular investments. If a fund holds investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class or geographic region, such fund may be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment portfolio to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could materially adversely affect a fund\u2019s performance and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could materially adversely affect a fund\u2019s operations and performance.\nInvestors in our private funds make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when we call capital from them for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations when due. Any investor that did not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including having a meaningful amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby limiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. Third-party investors in private funds often use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third-party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. A failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds could have a material adverse effect on the operation and performance of those funds.\nOur funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nOur funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund\u2019s term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, and the general partners of the funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, our funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nHedging strategies may materially and adversely affect the returns on our funds\u2019 investments.\nWhen managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps (including total return swaps), caps, collars, floors, foreign currency forward contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option contracts or other strategies. The success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market or foreign exchange changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into a transaction to reduce our or a fund\u2019s exposure to market risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when we or a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that may reduce the returns generated by a fund. Finally, the CFTC has made several public statements that it may soon issue a proposal for certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the cost of entering into currency hedges.\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from investors. If we were unable to raise such capital, we would be unable to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control. Investors may downsize their investment allocations to credit focused private funds or BDCs or to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our funds\u2019 performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds depends on our funds\u2019 performance. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of future funds. If we were unable to successfully raise capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our senior management team, senior investment professionals and other key personnel, and our ability to retain them and attract additional qualified personnel is critical to our success and our growth prospects.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of our senior management team, including Brook Taube and Seth Taube, our co-Chief Executive Officers, senior investment professionals and other key personnel. Our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our senior professionals and other key personnel and our ability to recruit additional qualified personnel. These individuals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing our funds\u2019 investments, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the source of many of our funds\u2019 investment opportunities and, in certain cases, have strong relationships with our investors. Therefore, if any of our senior professionals or other key personnel join competitors or form competing companies and we are unable to find suitable replacements, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing investors.\nThe departure for any reason of any of our senior professionals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives, cause certain of our investors to withdraw capital they invest with us or elect not to commit additional capital to our funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects. The departure of some or all of those individuals, including as a result of bankruptcies or insolvencies of the investment manager, or any parties controlling the investment manager, such as in connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, could also trigger certain \u201ckey man\u201d provisions in the documentation governing certain of our funds, which would permit the investors in those funds to suspend or terminate such funds\u2019 investment periods or, in the case of certain funds, permit investors to withdraw their capital prior to expiration of the applicable lock-up date. We do not carry any \u201ckey man\u201d insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our senior professionals, and we do not have a policy that prohibits our senior professionals from traveling together.\nWe anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals both to grow our business and to replace those who depart. However, the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or we may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to retain and attract investment professionals may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability or result in an increase in the portion of our performance fees that we grant to our investment professionals.\nOur failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nAs we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our business activities, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds\u2019 investment activities. Certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives, including funds that have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds. For example, a decision to receive material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action.\nIn most cases, Medley is permitted to co-invest among our private funds, our SMAs, our public business development company and other advisory clients pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC. We have adopted an order aggregation and trade allocation policy designed to ensure that all of our clients are treated fairly and to prevent this form of conflict from influencing the allocation of investment opportunities among clients. Allocations will generally be made pro rata principally based on each fund or advisory client's capital available for investment. It is Medley's policy to base its determinations as to the amounts of capital available for investment on such factors as: the amount of cash on hand, existing capital commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, the targeted asset mix and diversification requirements and other investment policies and restrictions or otherwise imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.\nWe may also cause different funds to invest in a single investee company, for example, where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest. We may also cause different funds that we advise to purchase different classes of investments or securities in the same investee company. For example, certain of our funds hold minority equity interests, or have the right to acquire such equity interests, in some of our investee companies. As a result, we may face conflicts of interests in connection with making business decisions for these investee companies to the extent that such decisions affect the debt and equity holders in these investee companies differently. In addition, we may face conflicts of interests in connection with making investment or other decisions, including granting loan waivers or concessions with respect to these investee companies given that we also manage private funds that may hold equity interests in these investee companies. In addition, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us and our funds. Though we believe we have developed appropriate policies and procedures to resolve these conflicts, our judgment on any particular allocation could be challenged. If we fail to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us.\nActions by activist investors relating to our affiliates can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Stockholder activism could create perceived uncertainties, which could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. Furthermore, stockholder activism could adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement strategic plans, including in connection with the proposed mergers.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise between our holders of Class A Common Stock and our fund investors.\nOur subsidiaries that serve as the investment advisors to, or the general partners of, our funds may have fiduciary duties and/or contractual obligations to those funds and their investors. As a result, we expect to regularly take actions with respect to the purchase or sale of investments in our funds, the structuring of investment transactions for the funds or otherwise in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations but that might at the same time adversely affect our near-term results of operations or cash flows. This may in turn have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock and/or on the interests of our holders of Class A Common Stock. Additionally, to the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts of interest, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds.\nWe may enter into new lines of business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and business, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe intend to grow our business by increasing assets under management in existing business and, if market conditions warrant, by expanding into complementary investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. Attempts to expand our business involve a number of special risks, including some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nthe required investment of capital and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities in any acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nentry into markets or lines of business in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on our operational and management systems and controls;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npotential increase in investor concentration; and\n\u2022\nthe broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently have no presence.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. Because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or lines of business, we cannot identify for you all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and your investment that may result from any attempted expansion.\nExtensive regulation affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The SEC oversees the activities of our subsidiaries that are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Investment Company Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to us, we could be subject to regulatory action or third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe SEC has indicated that investment advisers who receive transaction-based compensation for investment banking or acquisition activities relating to fund investee companies may be required to register as broker-dealers. Specifically, the SEC staff has noted that if a firm receives fees from a fund investee company in connection with the acquisition, disposition or recapitalization of such investee company, such activities could raise broker-dealer concerns under applicable regulations related to broker dealers. If we receive such transaction fees and the SEC takes the position that such activities render us a \u201cbroker\u201d under the applicable rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, we could be subject to additional regulation. If receipt of transaction fees from an investee company is determined to require a broker-dealer license, receipt of such transaction fees in the past or in the future during any time when we did not or do not have a broker-dealer license could subject us to liability for fines, penalties, damages or other remedies.\nCertain states and other regulatory authorities require investment managers to register as lobbyists in connection with their solicitation of commitments from governmental entities, including state and municipal pension funds. We have registered as such in a number of jurisdictions, including California and New York. Other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect. These registration requirements impose significant compliance obligations and restrictions on registered lobbyists and their employers, which may include annual registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping, and may also prohibit the payment of contingent fees.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Investment Advisers Act, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. We are involved regularly in trading activities that implicate a broad number of U.S. securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of the registration of our relevant subsidiaries as investment advisers or registered broker-dealers. The regulations to which our business is subject are designed primarily to protect investors in our funds and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our stockholders. Even if a sanction imposed against us, one of our subsidiaries or our personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us.\nFailure to comply with \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the \u201cpay to play\u201d regulatory regimes, could adversely affect our business.\nThe SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. Rule 206(4)-5 under the Investment Advisers Act regulates \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser\u2019s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers.\nAs a number of public pension plans are investors in our funds, these rules could impose significant economic sanctions on our business if we or one of the other persons covered by the rules make any such contribution or payment, whether or not material or with an intent to secure an investment from a public pension plan. In addition, such investigations may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines or forfeitures of fees paid and an obligation to provide services without payment of fees if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nNew or changed laws or regulations governing our funds\u2019 operations and changes in the interpretation thereof could adversely affect our business.\nThe laws and regulations governing the operations of our funds, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by our funds to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, assets under management or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. See \u201cBusiness - Regulatory and Compliance Matters\u201d for a discussion of our regulatory and compliance environment. The following includes the most significant regulatory risks facing our business:\nChanges in capital requirements may increase the cost of our financing.\nIf regulatory capital requirements - whether under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), Basel III, or other regulatory action - were to be imposed on our funds, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to others. Among other things, this could potentially require our funds to sell assets at an inopportune time or price, which could negatively impact our operations, assets under management or financial condition.\nThe imposition of additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers. Importantly, while numerous key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been defined through final rules, additional regulations thereunder or amendments thereunder may continue to be implemented by various regulatory bodies in the future. While we already have several subsidiaries registered as investment advisers subject to SEC examinations, the imposition of any additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe implementation of the Volcker Rule could have adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from certain entities.\nThe Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities, regardless of geographic location, from investing in or sponsoring \u201ccovered funds,\u201d which include private equity funds or hedge funds and certain other proprietary activities. The Volcker Rule may have the effect of further curtailing various banking activities that in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets as well as our business.\nOn May 30, 2018, the Federal Reserve Board voted to consider changes to the Volcker Rule that would loosen compliance requirements for all banks. The effect of this change and any further rules or regulations are and could be complex and far-reaching, and the change and any future laws or regulations or changes thereto could negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely affect our fundraising to any significant extent, there remains uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Volcker Rule and its practical implications (including as a result of the long-term effects of the Volcker Rule, as well as potential changes to the rule, and there could be adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition.\nIncreased regulation on banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to our funds and their investee companies.\nIn March 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published revised guidance regarding expectations for banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities. This guidance, and related or similar regulations restrict credit availability, as well as potentially restrict certain of our investing activities that rely on banks\u2019 lending activities. This could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to our funds and their investee companies.\nNew restrictions on compensation could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions. Such restrictions could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives.\nRegulatory uncertainty could negatively impact our ability to efficiently project, plan and operate our business impacting profitability.\nIn early February 2017, the Trump administration issued an executive order calling for a review of laws and regulations affecting the U.S. financial industry in order to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the executive order. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 was enacted to modify or repeal certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which increased from $50 billion to $250 billion the asset threshold for designation of \"systemically important financial institutions\" or \"SIFIs\" subject to enhanced prudential standards set by the Federal Reserve Board, staggering application of this change based on the size and risk of the covered bank holding company. The effect of this change and any further rules or regulations are and could be complex and far-reaching, and the change and any future laws or regulations or changes thereto could negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. In addition, as a result of proposed legislation, shifting areas of focus of regulatory enforcement bodies or otherwise, regulatory compliance practices may shift such that formerly accepted industry practices become disfavored or less common. Any changes or other developments in the regulatory framework applicable to our businesses, including the changes described above and changes to formerly accepted industry practices, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our funds. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nSIC and other BDCs for which we may serve as investment adviser in the future are subject to regulatory complexities that limit the way in which they do business and may subject them to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny.\nSIC, and other BDCs for which we may serve as investment adviser in the future, operate under a complex regulatory environment. Such BDCs require the application of complex tax and securities regulations and may entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, regulations affecting BDCs generally affect their ability to take certain actions. For example, SIC has elected to be treated as a RIC for United States federal income tax purposes. To maintain its status as a RIC, SIC must meet, among other things, certain source of income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. If SIC fails to qualify for RIC tax treatment for any reason and remains or becomes subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could, among other things, substantially reduce its net assets.\nIn addition, SIC is subject to complex rules under the Investment Company Act, including rules that restrict certain of our funds from engaging in transactions with SIC. Under the regulatory and business environment in which it operates, SIC must periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments in excess of its repayments to grow. This results from SIC being required to generally distribute to its respective stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income to maintain its RIC status, combined with regulations under the Investment Company Act that, subject to certain exceptions, generally prohibit SIC from issuing and selling its common stock at a price below NAV per share and from incurring indebtedness (including for this purpose, preferred stock), if its asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, equals less than 200% after such incurrence. If SIC is found to be in violation of the Investment Company Act, it could lose its status as a BDC. If SIC fails to continuously qualify as a BDC, it might be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease its operating flexibility. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against SIC, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks in using custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents.\nSome of our funds depend on the services of custodians, counterparties, administrators, prime brokers and other agents to carry out certain financing, securities and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight, although the Dodd-Frank Act provides for new regulation of the derivatives market. In particular, some of our funds utilize arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of such funds with these counterparties.\nOur funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.\nIn addition, our risk-management process may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.\nAlthough we have risk-management processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single counterparty for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. For example, some of our funds have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.\nIn the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of our contracts, one or more of our funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, our funds\u2019 cash held with a prime broker, custodian or counterparty generally will not be segregated from the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s own cash, and our funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. If our derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared and uncleared swaps. The CFTC is also working to provide new guidance regarding prime broker arrangements and intermediation generally with regard to trading on swap execution facilities.\nThe counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. For example, the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties. Our funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties have generally reacted to recent market volatility by tightening their underwriting standards and increasing their margin requirements for all categories of financing, which has the result of decreasing the overall amount of leverage available and increasing the costs of borrowing.\nA portion of our revenue and cash flow is variable, which may impact our ability to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nWe believe that base management fees are consistent and predictable. For all periods presented, over 40% of total revenues was derived from base management fees. Due to our investment strategy and the nature of our fees, a portion of our revenue and cash flow is variable, due primarily to the fact that the performance fees from our long-dated private funds and SMAs can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, we did not recognize any performance fees in 2018, 2019 or 2020, as we determined that it was not probable that a significant reversal of such fees would not occur in the future. Additionally, we may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds\u2019 investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period.\nWe may be subject to litigation risks and may face liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against investment managers have been increasing. We make investment decisions on behalf of investors in our funds that could result in substantial losses. This may subject us to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. Further, we may be subject to third-party litigation arising from allegations that we improperly exercised control or influence over portfolio investments. In addition, we and our affiliates that are the investment managers and general partners of our funds, our funds themselves and those of our employees who are our, our subsidiaries\u2019 or the funds\u2019 officers and directors are each exposed to the risks of litigation specific to the funds\u2019 investment activities and investee companies and, in the case where our funds own controlling interests in public companies, to the risk of shareholder litigation by the public companies\u2019 other shareholders. Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors or regulators relating to our having engaged, or our funds having engaged, in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.\nLegal liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm our business. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the investment industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our business.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our investee companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our business.\nOur ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds depends heavily upon the reputation of our professionals, especially our senior professionals. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our investment management business and our authority over the assets managed by our investment management business. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees could adversely affect investors in our funds and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which our funds may invest. If our employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one or more of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result, which would adversely impact our ability to raise future funds.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by personnel of investee companies in which our funds invest. For example, failures by personnel at our investee companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions or other legal and regulatory requirements could expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise adversely affect our business and reputation. Such misconduct could undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and could negatively affect the valuation of a fund\u2019s investments.\nIf our substantial indebtedness is not discharged in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts or raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized discount, premium, and issuance costs, was approximately $140.3 million. If our substantial indebtedness is not discharged in the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, our substantial debt obligations could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations and pursue future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including any restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, product development, satisfaction of debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including whether the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nAlthough we terminated our prior $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in May 2019, we may enter into a new revolving or other credit facility in the future or incur significant other or additional indebtedness in the future. Additional indebtedness incurred by the Company from time to time or at any time in the future could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses or limit our growth.\nOur business relies heavily on financial, accounting and other information systems and technology. We face various security threats, including cyber security attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems. These security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties outside of Medley. Although we have not yet been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled for any reason or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of our network security systems, a cyber-incident or attack or otherwise, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nIn addition, our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining the systems may increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to the information systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we depend on our office in New York, where a substantial portion of our personnel are located, for the continued operation of our business. An earthquake or other disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Although we have disaster recovery programs in place, these may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nFinally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems, technology and administration of our funds and compliance matters. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of our funds\u2019 operations and could impact our reputation, adversely affect our business and limit our ability to grow.\nThe effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our funds and related portfolio companies.\nThere may be evidence of global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk and some of our funds and related portfolio companies may be adversely affected by climate change. For example, the needs of customers of energy companies vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increases in the cost of energy could adversely affect the cost of operations of our funds and portfolio companies if the use of energy products or services is material to their business. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect some of our portfolio companies\u2019 financial condition, through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions.\nIn December 2015 the United Nations, of which the United States is a member, adopted a climate accord (the \"Paris Agreement\") with the long-term goal of limiting global warming and the short-term goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On November 4, 2016, the past administration announced that the U.S. would cease participation in the Paris Agreement with the withdrawal taking effect on November 4, 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement. As a result, some of our portfolio companies may become subject to new or strengthened regulations or legislation, which could increase their operating costs and/or decrease their revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nMedley Management Inc.\u2019s only material asset is its interest in Medley LLC, and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Medley LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement or pay dividends.\nMedley Management Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of LLC Units. Medley Management Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Medley Management Inc. intends to cause Medley LLC to make distributions to its holders of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments under the tax receivable agreement and dividends, if any, declared by it. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of Medley LLC and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that Medley Management Inc. needs funds, and Medley LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nPayments of dividends, if any, is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. Any financing arrangement that we enter into in the future may include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, Medley LLC is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Medley LLC (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of Medley LLC are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to Medley LLC.\nOn March 7, 2021, Medley LLC commenced the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the Bankruptcy Court. The Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case is captioned In re: Medley LLC, Case No. 21-10526 (KBO). Medley LLC is the only entity that has filed for Chapter 11 protection, Medley Management Inc. and the other affiliated adviser entities are not filing any bankruptcy petitions. Medley LLC will continue to operate its business as \u201cdebtor-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To ensure its ability to continue operating in the ordinary course of business, Medley LLC has filed with the Bankruptcy Court motions seeking a variety of \u201cfirst day\u201d relief, including authority to continue utilizing and maintaining its existing cash management system. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with our bankruptcy, including, among others that: (a) our prearranged plan of reorganization may never be confirmed or become effective, (b) the Bankruptcy Court may grant or deny motions in a manner that is adverse to Medley LLC, and (c) the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case may be converted into a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nMedley Management Inc. is controlled by our pre-IPO owners, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nAs of March 26, 2021, our Pre-IPO owners control 66.9% of the voting power of Medley Management Inc. through Class A Common Stock held by entities controlled by the pre-IPO owners. Medley Group LLC, an entity controlled by one of our pre-IPO owners, holds approximately 14.0% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B Common Stock as of March 26, 2021. Accordingly, our pre-IPO owners have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors, and thereby to control our management and affairs. In addition, they are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and are able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs a result of the LLC Unit exchange, Medley Management Inc. will be required to pay the former holders of LLC Units for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions that we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with the exchanges of LLC Units and related transactions.\nOn January 19, 2021, holders of LLC Units (other than Medley Management Inc.) exchanged 98% of their vested LLC Units (the \"Unitholders\") for Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (collectively, the \"Unit Exchange\"). The Unit Exchange is expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Medley LLC. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Medley Management Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the former and current holders of LLC Units (\"the Unitholders\") that provides for the payment by Medley Management Inc. to exchanging holders of LLC Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Medley Management Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of Medley Management Inc. and not of Medley LLC. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the extent to which the Unit Exchange is taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that as a result of the size of the transfers and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Medley LLC, the payments that Medley Management Inc. may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the former holders of LLC Units.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits Medley Management Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes of control, or if, at any time, Medley Management Inc. elects an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, Medley Management Inc.\u2019s obligations under the tax receivable agreement (with respect to all LLC Units whether or not previously exchanged) would be calculated by reference to the value of all future payments that Unitholders would have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement using certain valuation assumptions, including that Medley Management Inc. will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement and, in the case of an early termination election, that any LLC Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of termination. In addition, Unitholders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the IRS. Medley Management Inc.\u2019s ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing and amount of our future income. As a result, even in the absence of a change of control or an election to terminate the tax receivable agreement, payments under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of Medley Management Inc.\u2019s actual cash tax savings.\nAccordingly, it is possible that the actual cash tax savings realized by Medley Management Inc. may be significantly less than the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash tax savings that Medley Management Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and/or distributions to Medley Management Inc. by Medley LLC are not sufficient to permit Medley Management Inc. to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes and other expenses. Based upon the $7.99 closing price of our Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2020 and interest rate of 1.14%, we estimate that, if Medley Management Inc. were to have exercised its termination right on December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of these termination payments would have been approximately $58.7 million. The foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. We may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit holders of Class A Common Stock from acting by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office, but permit holders of Class B Common Stock to act by written consent without requiring any such recommendation;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline due to the large number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for sale or future issuance, including pursuant to the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization.\nThe market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of Class A common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. In addition, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization will provide for a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be reserved for issuance to employees and creditors. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of such sales or future issuances. These sales and future issuances, also might make it more difficult for holders of our Class A common stock to sell such stock in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.\nThe disparity in the voting rights among the classes of our capital stock may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nEach share of our Class A Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally. Medley Group LLC, as the holder of our Class B Common Stock, has a number of votes equal to 10 times the number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC for so long as our pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel hold at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units (excluding the LLC Units held by Medley Management Inc.). The difference in voting rights could adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock by, for example, delaying or deferring a change of control or if investors view, or any potential future purchaser of our company views, the superior voting rights of the Class B Common Stock to have value.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE\u2019s rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMedley Group LLC, an entity owned by our pre-IPO owners holds a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. In addition, because Medley Group LLC, as the holder of our Class B Common Stock, has a number of votes equal to 10 times the number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC for so long as our pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel hold at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and LLC Units (excluding the LLC Units held by Medley Management Inc.), we anticipate that Medley Group LLC will continue to have at least a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B Common Stock even when our pre-IPO owners own less than a majority economic interest in our company. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. For example, controlled companies:\n\u2022\nare not required to have a board that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of such exchange;\n\u2022\nare not required to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nare not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe are utilizing these exemptions. As a result, a majority of the directors on our board are not independent. In addition, our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an accelerated filer as defined in the Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price or trading volume to decline and our Class A common stock to be less liquid.\nThe market price of shares of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From January 2015 through December 2020, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high of $151.40 per share in the first quarter of 2015 to a low of $2.80 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to stockholders, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, and in response the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of Class A common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional Class A common stock or LLC Units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we had 1,938,141 shares of Class A Common Stock authorized but unissued, including approximately 49,999 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exchange of vested LLC Units that are held by the non-managing member of Medley LLC. On January 19, 2021, pursuant to that certain exchange agreement with the Unitholders, Medley Management Inc. issued to Unitholders an aggregate of 2,343,686 shares of Class A Common Stock.in exchange for an equivalent number of vested LLC Units held by Unitholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of Class A Common Stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Class A Common Stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Similarly, the limited liability company agreement of Medley LLC permits Medley LLC to issue an unlimited number of additional limited liability company interests of Medley LLC with designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the LLC Units, and which may be exchangeable for shares of our Class A Common Stock. Additionally, we have reserved an aggregate of 1,900,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and LLC Units for issuance under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (the \"Plan\"), including 402,314 shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted LLC Units granted as of March 26, 2021. Further, in connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock provided for in the 2014 Plan may be reserved for issuance to employees under the proposed Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. Any Class A Common Stock that we issue, including under our 2014 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by investors who purchase Class A Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 14908, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "MDLY"}
