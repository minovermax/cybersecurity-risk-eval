Risk Factors\nThe loss of a key distributor or customer in the Company\u2019s medical or custom products segments could cause a rapid and significant sales decline, which would likely result in a material decline in earnings. Many of our medical products are sold through large national distributors in the United States and Canada. We do not maintain long-term distribution agreements with most of these distributors. Instead, we supply them based on purchase orders that are issued by the customers on a daily or weekly basis. With minimal notice, either party can generally end these supplier-customer relationships. It is also possible that a non-participating distributor may acquire one or more distributors with whom we have a relationship, at which time the survivor distributor may decide to terminate the relationship. If a large customer or distributor decided to discontinue purchasing our products, our sales and earnings could quickly decline. Our largest customer in the medical segment is McKesson Corporation, which represented approximately 17% of our total net sales and 24% of our sales in the medical segment during fiscal 2016.\nHistorically, our consumer bedding products have been sold through our distributor, Hollander, under a marketing and distribution agreement that originally would have expired in December 2015. The agreement automatically renews for successive three-year terms unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew at least 60 days prior to the expiration date. Neither party provided the other with the requisite notice of intent not to renew the marketing and distribution agreement in 2015. The next renewal anniversary is December 2018. Sales to Hollander accounted for approximately 18% of our total net sales during fiscal 2016 and 57% of our sales in the custom products segment. The loss of the Hollander relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThrough May 2016, we shipped consumer products to a major consumer retailer through a different distributor, Sinomax. Hollander verbally consented to the separate distribution channel for this retailer. Sales to Sinomax accounted for approximately 6% of our total net sales during fiscal 2016 and 19% of our sales in the custom products segment, but that distributor relationship ended in May 2016.\nFor more information on major customers and information on our business segments, see the discussions under Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Industry Segment Data - Medical Segment - Distributor Relationships,\u201d Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Industry Segment Data - Custom Products Segment,\u201d Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Major Customers,\u201d Note 17 - Major Customers and Note 18 - Operations and Industry Segments and Geographic Areas in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur sales and earnings performance can be volatile when compared from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year because of the effect of (1) large, infrequently recurring orders of therapeutic support surfaces or medical beds in our medical segment and (2) limited-time or seasonal promotions that occur on an irregular basis in our custom products segment. Within our medical segment, our two largest volume product lines are therapeutic support surfaces and medical beds, which are sold primarily in the long-term care market. Since these products are sometimes purchased as part of capital improvement projects, the purchases can occur in large-volume quantities at irregular intervals. These large orders can cause volatility in our quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year sales and earnings comparisons.\nWithin our custom products segment, we have from time to time participated in several limited time, seasonal promotions of our consumer products. These promotions had the effect of temporarily increasing our sales and earnings during the periods the promotions took place. The promotions are conducted primarily at the sole discretion of our retail customers and therefore may or may not recur in future periods. While we benefit from these promotions when they take place, if similar promotions do not recur in future comparative periods, or if the quantities ordered or prices accepted are less than the comparable prior-year period, it creates an unfavorable sales and earnings comparison with prior-year periods. This situation might obscure or overshadow more gradual favorable changes, or less dramatic unfavorable changes, in our ordinary course of business, which we believe more accurately reflect the long-term financial health of our business.\nPossible downturns in the U.S. economy combined with uncertainties about health care reform and tax policy could cause our sales to decline, which in turn could have a material negative effect on our earnings. The largest volume product lines within our medical segment are our lines of therapeutic support surfaces, which consist of our PressureGuard and Geo-Mattress products as well as our private-label support surfaces, and our lines of medical beds for the long-term care market. These products are generally considered by us and our customers to be capital purchase items instead of consumable supplies. We believe that purchases of these capital goods are more easily postponed during business downturns than purchases of consumables. Consequently, sales of our support surfaces and medical beds are likely to be more sensitive to general economic weakness than other medical product lines in our business. Also, uncertainties about federal and state tax policy, interest rate projections and the implementation or repeal of health care reform could cause our customers to delay, reduce or cancel capital expenditure plans, which could slow sales particularly within our support surface and medical bed product lines. Therapeutic support surface sales made up 39% of total Company sales during fiscal 2016 and increased 3% during the year compared with fiscal 2015. Sales of medical beds made up 14% of total Company sales during fiscal 2016. Sales of therapeutic support surfaces and medical beds could decline if economic conditions worsen or if health care reform and changes in tax policy result in reduced demand from our customers.\nIn addition, our industrial products are sold primarily to the automotive, packaging and water sports industries, as well as various other manufacturers. Our industrial business has historically been more affected by general economic trends than other Span-America product lines. Therefore an economic downturn is likely to have a greater effect on sales of industrial products than on other product lines in our business. Sales of industrial products could decline if economic conditions worsen.\nSince many of our operating costs are fixed within a normal monthly range of sales and production activity, sales declines could result in proportionally greater declines in earnings performance. We would attempt to reduce expenses in response to lower sales levels, but we cannot give assurance that we would be able to fully offset the effect of a decline in sales volume. As a result, our business could be materially adversely affected by an economic downturn or weakness in the economy.\nDownturns in the U.S. and global economies could also have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of one or more of our key customers or distributors or on several customers and distributors that, in the aggregate, account for a material portion of our sales. Such an adverse effect on our customers or distributors could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our own business and/or financial condition as a result of a loss or material reduction in our sales to such customers or distributors and also, potentially, our inability to collect a material amount of accounts receivable (which accounts receivable are unsecured) owed to us by such customers or distributors if they become unable to pay their debts.\nSince our therapeutic support surfaces and medical bed products are considered to be capital purchases by our customers, some customers may have to borrow all or a portion of the funds necessary to purchase our products. In this event, the current and projected levels of interest rates may, if such rates are increasing or are projected to increase, have a material adverse effect on the customers\u2019 order quantities and our resulting sales to those customers.\nIf some or all of our medical products were determined to be subject to the medical device excise tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act, there could be a material adverse effect on our net income. Beginning January 1, 2013, the Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of products defined as \u201cmedical devices\u201d by the regulations of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) unless the products fit within certain exemptions enumerated in the Affordable Care Act. Subsequently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 imposed a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax on medical device sales from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. We believe that all of our medical products except for Selan\u00ae skin care products are \u201cmedical devices\u201d within the meaning of the FDA regulations. We also believe that our medical products are exempt from the excise tax because our interpretation is that they meet the definition that is commonly referred to as the \u201cRetail Exemption.\u201d The Retail Exemption provision allows an exemption for medical devices of a type that can be purchased by the general public at retail for individual use if (1) the device is regularly available for purchase and use by individual consumers who are not medical professionals, and (2) the device\u2019s design demonstrates that it is not primarily intended for use in a medical institution or office or by medical professionals. While we believe all of our medical products are exempt, the Retail Exemption is based on a facts-and-circumstances inquiry into numerous factors listed in the Affordable Care Act rather than a \u201cbright line\u201d standard. If some or all of our medical products were found to be medical devices subject to the excise tax, we could incur material tax expenses on our sales of medical devices which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, earnings and financial condition. Our medical sales excluding Selan totaled $11.1 million from October 2015 through December 2015 (when the moratorium took effect), $46.6 million in fiscal 2015, $41.1 million in fiscal year 2014 and $35.6 million in the nine-month period from January 2013 (when the tax became effective) through our fiscal year ended in September 2013. If the excise tax were found to apply to all of our medical products (other than Selan products), our additional tax expense (excluding interest and penalties) would be approximately $255,000 for fiscal 2016, $1,071,000 for fiscal year 2015, $945,000 for fiscal year 2014 and approximately $819,000 for the nine-month period from January 2013 through September 2013. Of course, actual future sales levels and the amount of any applicable excise tax would vary.\nOur acquisition of M.C. Healthcare in December 2011 has introduced different risks for the Company, including those related to international operations, foreign exchange, a unionized workforce and impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. M.C. Healthcare\u2019s manufacturing facility is located in Beamsville, Ontario, Canada. We are leasing the current facility under a five-year lease agreement as described elsewhere in this report. As a result, we have been operating in a foreign country under different laws, regulations and customs, all of which have added potential new risks and costs to the Company.\nPrior to the acquisition, Span-America had no material foreign exchange risk. As a result of the acquisition, we now manufacture and sell products in both the U.S. and Canada. Revenues and costs are incurred in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. We are therefore subject to realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation activities related to our operations. These foreign exchange gains or losses could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Item 7. \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Foreign Currency Exchange\u201d and Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for more information on foreign exchange risk.\nSpan-America had no material experience in managing a unionized workforce prior to the M.C. Healthcare acquisition. Most of the manufacturing employees at our Beamsville, Ontario plant are members of a union. We are therefore subject to risks related to the management of union employees such as work slowdowns or stoppages, compliance with the terms of the union agreement and periodic contract negotiations. However, we believe that our relations with our employees are good.\nThe M.C. Healthcare acquisition resulted in additional goodwill of approximately $2.5 million. We evaluate this goodwill at least annually for possible impairment. If the goodwill became impaired and not recoverable, it could result in a material non-cash charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Item 7. \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Impairment of Goodwill\u201d and Note 5 - Goodwill in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on goodwill impairment.\nOur medical business could lose sales volume or could have a lower sales growth rate as a result of government reimbursement changes in the medical market. Most of our end-user customers in the long term care and acute care markets are eligible for reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) for patient care and treatment. The reimbursement in these markets is done generally on a per diem basis, depending on the condition and needs of each patient. We receive no direct reimbursements from CMS, but our end-user customers often submit reimbursement requests to CMS. For example, we sell therapeutic support surfaces to long-term care facilities, which, in many cases, receive per-diem-based reimbursements from CMS for the care and treatment of the patients in these facilities. If the CMS reimbursement rates are reduced, the demand for our medical products could decrease, because a reduction in CMS reimbursement rates reduces the revenue of the affected facilities. The potential decrease in demand for our medical products would depend on the size of the CMS rate reduction. A significant rate reduction could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings.\nOur earnings could be negatively affected by raw material cost increases that we are unable to recover through sales price increases. The cost of polyurethane foam represented approximately 36% of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal 2016. An increase in foam raw material costs that we are not able to pass through to our customers by increasing prices could have a significant negative effect on our profitability. Besides polyurethane foam, our other major raw material categories include therapeutic support surface covers made of various water-proof fabrics, vinyl bags, vinyl air cylinders, electronic components for medical beds and support surfaces, motors, pneumatic pumps, blowers, corrugated boxes, bed positioning actuators, steel and metal stampings. Raw materials are our single largest cost category, representing approximately 73% of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal 2016. Cost increases in these raw materials could have a significant adverse effect on earnings if we are unable to recover the higher costs through sales price increases or operating expense reductions.\nChanges in applicable laws or increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased raw material costs or other costs, which would negatively affect our profitability.\nOur sales volume could decline as a result of competition from low-cost foreign imports. During the last several years, we have experienced increased competition in our medical and custom products segments from low-cost foreign imports. In the medical segment, the number of low-cost, imported mattress and bed products has increased, but it has not yet had a significant impact on our medical business. We believe that we have potentially greater exposure to low-cost imports in our consumer bedding product lines because those products have more commodity-like characteristics than our medical products. Also, our customers in the consumer market, which are usually national retailers, are generally more likely to change suppliers to buy lower-cost products than our customers in the medical market. Therefore, we could lose significant sales volume in our consumer bedding business and some portion of our medical sales volume if we are unable to compete effectively with low-cost imports.\nSubstantially all of our medical products are classified as medical devices and are regulated by the FDA and Health Canada. These regulations require, among other things, that medical device manufacturers register with the FDA and Health Canada, list devices manufactured by them, and file various reports. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d as required by the FDA, state and Canadian regulatory authorities. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable regulations, the existence of the regulations creates the risk of a product recall and related expenses as well as the risk of additional expenses required to meet new regulatory requirements.\nLoss of key personnel, and/or our inability to attract qualified personnel including qualified hourly production personnel, may limit our ability to grow and reduce our ability to compete. We are committed to the idea that the people engaged in working for the Company are our strongest and best resource. Most recently, it has been difficult to find and retain qualified production personnel in Greenville. If we are unable to attract and retain production personnel, then production of our products could be compromised. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good, but in the event of a significant work slowdown or work stoppage, our sales and profitability would be materially adversely affected.\nOur sales volume could decline in the event other devices or pharmaceuticals are determined to be more effective than our products for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Our therapeutic support surfaces are designed and indicated for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. In the event that other devices or pharmaceuticals are demonstrated to be superior to our therapeutic support surfaces in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers, and if we are unable to respond to the challenge with our own new products of a superior type, then we could experience a material sales and profitability decline.\nOur ability to compete effectively in the medical market is dependent on a continuous stream of innovation in the form of new, more medically effective and more cost effective new products. Our product development results are very important in maintaining and expanding our competitive position in the medical marketplace. If for whatever reason, including loss of key personnel, regulatory setbacks or delays, lack of adequate financial resources, the inability to access needed technologies due to such technologies being subject to intellectual property ownership by others, a key product development not meeting performance requirements, premature product obsolescence and other factors, we are unable to keep up the rate of new product design and development, our competitive position in the marketplace could be compromised resulting in a decrease in sales and earnings.\nOne of the key strengths of our Company is its sales organization, including field sales representatives and specialists, and such strength is dependent on the continuity of our sales organization. Loss of a significant portion of our sales organization, be it to our direct competition, other medical device companies, our inability to provide competitive compensation, illnesses, retirement or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our sales level or our rate of sales increase.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, particularly our foam suppliers, to have the ability to meet our needs on a timely basis for raw materials used in our products. In the event our suppliers, particularly our foam suppliers, cannot respond on time to our orders for raw materials, or in the event one or more key suppliers go out of the business, we may incur backorders and in turn may not be able to produce our products in time to fill orders from our customers. If this situation occurred, our customers may cancel their orders with us and seek substitute products from our competition, in which case we could lose market share and experience a decrease in sales, or a decrease in the rate of sales growth.\nA shortage of one or more chemicals used in the production of foam could result in a reduction in the supply of foam and an increase in the price. As noted above, various types of foam represent the most prevalent raw material in many of our products. In turn, foam is comprised of various chemicals purchased by our foam suppliers for the production of their foam products. In the event of a shortage of any of the key chemicals, the foam suppliers may not be able to produce the foam we order and/or the price could be higher to reflect the chemical shortage, in which case we may not be able to produce our products at planned costs, we may not be able to increase the price sufficiently to cover the cost, we may incur backorders and we may suffer reduced profitability.\nAdverse product liability settlements could have a material impact on our reputation, sales and profitability. While we believe our products are safe, efficacious and reliable, and we believe our products meet all known regulatory requirements in the markets in which they are sold, customers and/or patients may take a different position. The Company maintains insurance coverage that would mitigate costs related to products liability claims. However, a material adverse products liability settlement or judgment could damage our reputation, require the payment of costs, fines and legal expenses, result in the loss of one or more customers and potentially risk a reduction in sales or the rate of sales increase.\nLarger, well-established competitors dominate the markets in which we compete. Virtually all of our competitors for our therapeutic surfaces, medical beds and custom products range from somewhat larger to substantially larger than the Company. While we believe we are holding or gaining market share in our largest product lines, depending on the particular market, larger, well-financed competitors present a formidable challenge. If we are unable to compete effectively with these larger competitors, we could lose market share, and sales could decrease.\nOur growth has been fueled by a combination of organic growth from product development interspersed with occasional acquisitions. Product development risks are discussed above. In the event suitable acquisitions are not available, are too expensive, are too complex, or if available, are unreasonable in price, are not straightforward, are a distraction to management, are difficult to integrate, or result in distributor dislocations, among other problems, our growth component related to acquisitions could be hindered, resulting in a reduction in the rate of sales increase at best, and Company management and customer distraction could result at worst, and ultimately, the acquisition could fail to be additive to the Company. In addition, if capital to fund acquisitions is not available or too expensive, then our ability to grow through acquisitions could be limited to those that could be funded internally.\nWhile we are not solely dependent on our intellectual property and trade secrets to protect our products, to a certain extent these protections provide a deterrent to the competition. If for whatever reason we are unable to protect our intellectual property in the form of patent claims, trade secrets including know-how, and trademarks, then new or more aggressive competition would be anticipated with the result that our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nA successful cyber-attack on our computer system and network could seriously disrupt our operations and compromise Company and customer information. While we have purchased and installed software designed to ward off hostile cyber-attacks, we are not immune from a focused cyber-attack. A successful cyber-attack could make it impossible to enter orders from customers, place orders with suppliers, conduct supply chain operations, invoice customers, meet payroll and conduct other day to day operational tasks using our computer system. Such an event could lead to our inability to supply customers on time, large and lengthy backorders, a sharp decline in customer service levels, and as a result, a decrease in sales and profitability.\nStorms, fires, floods, and the like could interrupt our operations and prevent a rapid return to operating status, which could compromise our ability to supply our customers and result in a loss of sales and a reduction in profitability. With the exception of a few \u201cpurchased\u201d products for resale, we manufacture all of our products in one of only two locations. Medical beds are produced in our Beamsville, Ontario, Canada location but not in our Greenville location, and our therapeutic support surfaces are primarily produced in Greenville but not in Beamsville. In the event of a damaging hurricane, tornado, fire or flood in Greenville, or a damaging blizzard, fire or flood in Beamsville, the ability to produce certain products could be seriously compromised for a lengthy period of time. To the extent products may not be available to satisfy customer orders, our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nSpan-America is a microcap public company with a limited outstanding common stock float, limited analyst coverage, and relatively light daily trading volume, all of which may constrain buy and sell transactions to small quantities over an extended period of time. Existing and prospective shareholders may find it difficult to buy or sell the desired quantities of our common stock without impacting the stock price either negatively or positively depending on the desired transaction. As such, it may be necessary to achieve the desired total transaction in several smaller quantity steps, with the result that transaction costs to the shareholder could be more than transaction costs for a single transaction. While we believe our repurchase of common stock in October 2015 was in the best interest of the shareholders, the common stock repurchased by the Company was retired, resulting in a further reduction in the float.\nIf, for any of the reasons noted above, or other factors within or beyond our control, our free cash flow is materially constrained in any quarterly period or for any longer period of time, we may not be able to continue to pay all or a portion of our current dividend to shareholders. While our management and Board are proud of the Company\u2019s record in creating value for shareholders and in returning a portion of such value to shareholders periodically in the form of regular quarterly dividends and special dividends, management and the Board acknowledge that the future payment of such dividends is dependent upon many factors including the avoidance of the material negative impact of any of the risk factors noted above, or any other risk factors not so noted above that are beyond reasonable expectations at this time.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we began distributing certain of our medical products through a local distributor in Australia. As we expand the distribution of our products beyond North America, the company will be subject to increased risks related to various anti-corruption laws in the countries where we do business. The laws of most countries make the payment or offer of payment or receipt of a bribe, kickback or other corrupt payment a crime, subjecting both the company and individual employees to criminal and civil penalties, including fines and prison sentences. These anti-corruption laws include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). If our employees or representatives fail to comply with these anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, the company could be subject to penalties and fines, which could disrupt our business and have negative financial and legal consequences.", "PERMNO": 71942, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "SPAN"}
