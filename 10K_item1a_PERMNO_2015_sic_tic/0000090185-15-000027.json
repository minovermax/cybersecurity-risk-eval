{"cik": "90185", "company": "SIGMA ALDRICH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, certain economic, political and technological factors. You should carefully consider the risk factors below, together with other matters described in this Report or incorporated herein by reference, in evaluating our business and prospects. If any one or more of the following risks occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely impacted and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe announcement and pendency of our proposed merger with Merck KGaA could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition of our Company by Merck KGaA could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations, regardless of whether the proposed merger is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the proposed acquisition. We could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the transaction, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the merger as provided in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, certain restrictions on capital spending levels, our ability to repurchase shares, increase our dividend, acquire other businesses, sell, transfer or license our assets, amend our organizational documents and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations.\nFailure to complete the proposed merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance that the closing of the merger will occur. Consummation of the merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of specific closing conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of certain antitrust and governmental approvals and other customary closing conditions. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the outstanding conditions will be satisfied. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we are required to pay Merck KGaA a termination fee. If the merger is not consummated, our stock price will likely decline as our stock has recently traded at prices based on the proposed per share price for the merger. We will have incurred significant costs, including, among other things, the diversion of management resources, for which we may receive little or no benefit if the closing of the merger does not occur. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of our Company in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.\nOur performance may be affected by the economic conditions in the United States and in other nations where we do business.\nDeclining economic conditions as a result of inflation, rising interest rates, limitations on access to and the functioning of capital markets, changes in spending patterns at pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic companies and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Overall demand for our products could be reduced as a result of a global economic recession, especially in such customer segments as the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, chemical, industrial and electronics industries and academia.\nWe face significant competition, including changes in pricing.\nThe markets for our products and services are both competitive and price sensitive. Many of our competitors have significant financial operations, sales and marketing resources and experience in research and development. Existing or new competitors could develop new technologies that compete with our products and services or even render our products obsolete. If a competitor develops superior technology or cost-effective alternatives to our products and services, our business could be harmed.\n- 6 -\nThe markets for some of our products are also subject to specific competitive risks because these markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. If they do so again, we may be forced to respond by lowering our prices. This may reduce profits and possibly sales. Failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may also impact sales and profits.\nNew entrants or significant expansion of sales channel and logistics competitors may erode sales.\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in e-commerce services, warehousing and logistics. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment and marketing. Competition may intensify as our competitors deploy or improve their technology and speed of delivery to customers or as established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content and electronic devices, may increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.\nConsolidation trends in both our industry and that of our customers have changed industry dynamics.\nThe industries in which we compete have been subject to increasing consolidation for the past several years. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation would affect our competitive position.\nAdditionally, there has been a trend toward consolidation among our customers, notably in the pharmaceutical industry. Consolidation in our customer markets results in increased competition for important market segments and fewer available accounts. Larger consolidated customers may be able to exert increased pricing pressure on industry participants.\nWe must continually offer new products and technologies.\nOur success depends in large part on continuous and timely development and introduction of new products that address evolving customer needs and changes in the market. We believe customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their supplier of a particular product. We also believe that because of the initial time investment required by many of our customers to reach a purchasing decision for a new product, it may be difficult to regain that customer once the customer purchases a product from a competitor. To the extent we are not the first to develop, offer and/or supply new products, customers may buy from our competitors or make products themselves, causing our competitive position to suffer.\nThese facts have led us to focus significant efforts and resources on the development and identification of new technologies, products and services. As a result, we have a very broad product line and are continually seeking to develop, license or acquire new technologies, products and services to further broaden our offerings. If we fail in these efforts, our customers likely will purchase products from our competitors, significantly harming our business. Once we develop or obtain a technology, to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new and innovative products that are accepted by our markets, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on our R&D, licensing and acquisition investments and could lose market share to our competitors, which may be difficult or impossible to regain and could damage our business.\nIn addition, technology innovations, which our current and potential customers might have access to, could create alternatives to our products and reduce or eliminate the need for our products. Our failure to develop, introduce or enhance products able to compete with new technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales and results of operations depend on our customers\u2019 research and development efforts and their ability to obtain funding for these efforts.\nOur customers include researchers at companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, chemical, electronics and related industries, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Fluctuations in the R&D budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Our customers determine their R&D budgets based on several factors, including the need to develop new products, the availability of governmental and other funding, competition and the general availability of resources. As we continue to expand our international operations, we expect R&D spending levels in markets outside of the United States will become increasingly important to us.\n- 7 -\nR&D budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, spending priorities, general economic conditions, institutional and governmental budgetary limitations and mergers of companies in the key industry sectors we serve. Our business could be seriously harmed by any significant decrease in life science and high technology R&D expenditures by our customers. In addition, credit availability may impact the ability of small, emerging pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic companies to access funding.\nA portion of our sales have been to researchers whose funding is dependent on grants from government agencies across the globe. In the United States, these agencies include the U.S. National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute and similar agencies or organizations. Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process and budget process, which are often unpredictable. Any shift away from funding of life science and high technology R&D, delays surrounding the approval of governmental budget proposals or further United States federal government shutdowns may cause our customers to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services, which could damage our business.\nSome of our customers receive funds from approved grants at a particular time of year, many times set by government budget cycles. In the past, such grants have been frozen for extended periods or have otherwise become unavailable to various institutions without advance notice. The timing of the receipt of grant funds may affect the timing of purchase decisions by our customers and, as a result, cause fluctuations in our sales and operating results.\nLikewise, public support of R&D in key markets in Europe and elsewhere has come under pressure, which may lead to decreased sales of our products in those jurisdictions.\nThe Company may not be able to realize the expected benefits of its investments in emerging markets.\nThe Company has been taking steps to increase its presence in emerging markets. However, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s efforts to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend. In order for the Company to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, it must attract and retain qualified personnel. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and the Company cannot offset the devaluations, the Company\u2019s financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected. For these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks. However, a failure to continue to expand the Company\u2019s business in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of the Company\u2019s operations.\nDue to heavy reliance on manufacturing and related operations to produce, package and distribute the products we sell, our business could be adversely affected by disruptions of these operations.\nWe rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce products accounting for approximately 60 percent of our sales and several products are produced solely at one facility. Our quality control, packaging and distribution operations support all of our sales. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, natural disasters or other events beyond our control, could adversely affect our sales, product distribution and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. While insurance coverage may reimburse us, in whole or in part, for profits lost from such disruptions, our ability to provide these products in the longer term may affect our sales growth expectations and results.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems throughout the Company to control our manufacturing processes, process orders, manage inventory, process and bill shipments to and collect cash from our customers, respond to customer inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment and record and pay amounts due vendors and other creditors. Additionally, in 2014, approximately 48 percent of the Company\u2019s Research and Applied sales originated through e-commerce. As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain business operations. As we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality and other problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n- 8 -\nOur information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters, power outages, hardware failures, viruses, break-ins, sabotage, acts of terrorism, acts of vandalism, hacking, cyber-terrorism and similar misconduct. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and international agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture and distribution of products and environmental matters.\nSome of our operations are subject to regulation by various United States federal agencies and similar state and international agencies, including the CBP, DEA, DHS, DOC, DOT, FDA, NRC, USDA and other comparable United States, state, local and international governmental agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, handling, sales, distribution, importing and exporting of products. If we fail to comply with any or all of these regulations, we may be subject to fines or penalties, have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our sales.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we have agreements in place for the sale of our products to government entities; consequently, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. A failure to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nOur manufacturing processes for certain products involve the use of chemical and other substances that are regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes. There can be no assurance that any such changes would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to regulations that govern the handling of hazardous substances.\nWe are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the handling, transportation, manufacture, use, storage, disposal and sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances. Some risk of environmental and property damage and environmental liabilities, including potential cleanup liability relating to currently or formerly owned or operated sites or third party disposal sites and liabilities relating to the exposure to hazardous substances, is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, sell or distribute. Any failure by us to comply with the applicable government regulations could also result in product recalls or impositions of significant fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on with or expand a portion or possibly all of our operations. If we fail to comply with any or all of these regulations, we may be subject to fines or penalties, have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our sales.\nChanges in worldwide tax rates or tax benefits will impact our tax expense and profits.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes in numerous local, regional, national and international jurisdictions. The laws regulating the taxes to which we are subject may change. We have no control over these changes and their impact, if any, on our results. Additionally, results of tax audit activity may also impact our tax provision and our profits. We reflect changes in our actual or forecast income tax rates as relevant facts and circumstances are known to us.\nLitigation may harm our business.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur significant costs and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by governmental authorities, employees, shareholders, suppliers, collaborators, distributors, customers, competitors or others with protected intellectual property could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with such companies, organizations or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to resolve such disputes or do so on terms favorable to us. Unexpected results could cause us to have financial exposure in these matters in excess of recorded reserves and insurance coverage, requiring us to provide additional reserves to address these liabilities, therefore impacting profits.\n- 9 -\nPotential product liability claims could affect our earnings and financial condition and harm our reputation.\nWe face potential liability claims arising out of the use of or exposure to our products and/or services. We carry product liability insurance coverage, generally available in the market, but which is limited in scope and amount. While our products are generally used by trained scientists and operators, there is no assurance that they will be used in accordance with our terms and conditions of sale. As a result, we could be forced to defend ourselves in connection with the use of these products or services.\nAlthough we seek to reduce our potential liability through measures such as contractual indemnification provisions with customers and/or suppliers, we cannot assure you that such measures will be enforced or effective. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of the indemnification agreements, if the indemnity, although applicable, is not executed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance or indemnification. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. Unexpected results could cause us to have financial exposure in these matters in excess of recorded reserves and insurance coverage, requiring us to provide additional reserves to address these liabilities, therefore impacting profits.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate quality standards for our products and services, our business may be adversely affected and our reputation harmed.\nOur life science and high technology customers are often subject to rigorous quality standards to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of their products and the manufacturing processes that generate them. A failure to maintain, or in some instances upgrade, our quality standards to meet our customers\u2019 needs could result in a breach of our contractual obligations or the loss of a customer\u2019s regulatory license, which may cause us to incur significant liabilities to such customers or result in substantial sales losses and reputational harm.\nDemand for our products and services is subject to the commercial success of our customers\u2019 products, which may vary for reasons outside our control.\nEven if we are successful in securing utilization of our products in a customer\u2019s manufacturing process, sales of many of our products and services remain dependent on the timing and volume of the customer\u2019s production, over which we have no control. The demand for our products depends on regulatory approvals and frequently depends on the commercial success of the customer\u2019s supported product. Regulatory processes are complex, lengthy and expensive and can often take years to complete. Commercial success of a customer\u2019s product, which would drive demand in their production and commensurate demand for our products and services, is dependent on many factors, some of which can change rapidly, despite early positive indications.\nWe rely heavily on third party transportation providers and other package delivery services, and a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products or import materials, increase our costs, lower our profitability and harm our reputation.\nWe emphasize our prompt service and shipment of products as a key element of our sales and marketing strategy. We ship a significant number of products to our customers through independent package delivery companies. In addition, we transport materials between our worldwide facilities and import raw materials from worldwide sources. Consequently, we rely heavily on both sea and air cargo carriers and other third party package delivery providers. If any of our key third party providers were to experience a significant disruption in services such that any of our products, components or raw materials could not be delivered in a timely fashion, our costs may increase and our relationships with certain customers may be adversely affected. In addition, if these third party providers increase prices and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments to our selling prices, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the availability, quality and prices of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to obtain high quality raw materials at reasonable prices. Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, the availability and costs of these raw materials may fluctuate significantly from time to time. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n- 10 -\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nMost of our products and services are highly technical in nature. In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop, manufacture and market our products and provide our services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safety and compliance, information technology, sales and e-commerce related positions require persons possessing highly technical skills. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to identify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors, customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Any failure on our part to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals would seriously damage our business.\nWe depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believe that our future success depends on the continued services of our management team. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significant number of our senior management members in a short period of time.\nRapid changes in the healthcare industry could directly or indirectly adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our sales is derived from companies in the healthcare industry. This industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to control costs. These changes include:\n\u2022\ndevelopment of large and sophisticated group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nhealthcare reform legislation;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of pharmaceutical companies;\n\u2022\nincreased outsourcing of certain activities, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical, to low-cost offshore locations;\n\u2022\nlower reimbursements for R&D; and\n\u2022\nlegislative limitations on healthcare research.\nWe expect the healthcare industry to continue to change in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the ability to perform healthcare related research and the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.\nWe may be unable to establish and maintain collaborative development and marketing relationships with business partners, which could result in a decline in sales or slower than anticipated growth rates.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we have formed, and intend to continue to form, strategic alliances and distribution arrangements with partners relating to the development and commercialization of certain of our existing and potential products to increase our sales and to leverage our product and service offerings. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain these relationships and to cultivate additional, acceptable strategic alliances with such companies.\nIn addition, we cannot ensure that parties with which we have established, or will establish, collaborative relationships will not, either directly or in collaboration with others, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products in addition to, or instead of, products offered as a result of these collaborations. Our business partners may also experience financial or other difficulties that lessen their value to us and to our customers. Our results of operations and opportunities for growth may be adversely affected by our failure to establish and maintain successful collaborative relationships.\nLack of early success with our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers could exclude us from future business with those customers.\nA number of the products we sell to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers are incorporated into the customers\u2019 drug manufacturing processes. In some cases, once a customer chooses a particular product for use in a drug manufacturing process, it is unlikely that the customer will later switch to a competing alternative. In many cases, the regulatory license for the product will specify the products qualified for use in the process. Obtaining the regulatory approvals needed for a change in the manufacturing process is time consuming, expensive and uncertain. Accordingly, if a pharmaceutical or biotechnology customer does not select our products early in its manufacturing design phase for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, cost, ease of use, ability to supply large quantities or similar reasons, we may lose the opportunity to participate in the customer\u2019s manufacturing of such product. Because we face competition in this market from other companies, we run the risk that our competitors could win significant early business with a customer making it difficult for us to recover the late stage commercialization opportunity.\n- 11 -\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our results of operations.\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to protect and maintain proprietary rights to our intellectual property, particularly trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We generally enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for or adequate remedies to protect the Company\u2019s technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Efforts to address any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in diversion of management\u2019s time and significant costs through litigation or otherwise. In addition, the laws of other countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar services, potentially resulting in the loss of one or more competitive advantages and decreased sales.\nDespite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws afford us only limited protection. Others may attempt to copy or re-engineer aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our products or trade secrets, or deter others from developing similar products. Further, monitoring the unauthorized use of our products and other proprietary rights is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation.\nWe may become involved in disputes regarding our intellectual property rights, which could result in prohibition of the use of certain technology in current or planned products, exposure of the business to significant liability and diversion of management\u2019s focus.\nWe and our major competitors spend substantial time and resources developing and patenting new and improved products and technologies. Many of our products are based on complex, rapidly developing technologies. Further, while we strive to respect others\u2019 intellectual property, we may not have identified each and every instance where our products may infringe or utilize intellectual property rights held by others. Thus, we cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe those rights.\nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive;\n\u2022\ntake significant time and divert management\u2019s focus from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nif successful, require us to stop the infringing activity, redesign our product or process or license the intellectual property in question, thereby resulting in delays and loss or deferral of sales;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay substantial damage awards; and/or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain a royalty agreement or license on acceptable terms, or are unable to redesign our products or processes to avoid conflicts with any third party patent, we may be unable to offer some of our products, which could result in reduced sales.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our business.\nSince we are a multinational corporation that sells and sources products in many different countries, changes in exchange rates have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Reported sales and purchases made and expenses incurred in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. For example, the effect of translating foreign currency sales into U.S. Dollars decreased 2014 and 2013 sales by 1 percent and decreased 2012 sales by 3 percent. The effect of translating foreign earnings into U.S. Dollars decreased 2014, 2013 and 2012 EPS by $0.09, $0.05 and $0.22, respectively. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results.\nWe are subject to economic, political and other risks associated with our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe operate internationally through wholly-owned subsidiaries located in North and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia and Africa. Sales outside the United States were in excess of 64 percent of total sales in 2014. We expect that\n- 12 -\nsales from international operations will continue to represent a growing portion of our sales. During 2014, approximately 17 percent of the Company\u2019s United States operations\u2019 chemical and equipment purchases were from international suppliers. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers of our international operations are located outside the United States. Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nfuture fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncomplex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, tariffs, royalties or taxes and import or export licensing requirements or restrictions;\n\u2022\nmultiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from international operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing worldwide operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in shipping costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting on accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing intellectual property rights.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we could face a loss of sales and/or substantial increases in costs, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy.\nWe have acquired or invested in several businesses and technologies and routinely review additional opportunities. Certain risks exist including, without limitation, the potential for:\n\u2022\nincreasing debt levels to fund sizable acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition or investment failing to provide, or delays in realizing, the benefits originally anticipated by management;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations and systems of the acquired businesses and in realizing operating synergies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s attention being diverted to the integration of the acquired businesses or acceptance of the acquired technology;\n\u2022\nrising interest rates on debt needed to provide cash to fund the purchase price of acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated contract or regulatory issues.\nNone of these difficulties have been historically significant, but if they were to be in the future, we may be unable to achieve expectations from our acquisition strategy. In addition, we compete with other companies for suitable acquisition targets and may not be able to acquire certain targets that we seek. Also, certain businesses we have acquired or invested in may not generate the cash flow and/or earnings or other benefits we anticipated at the time of their acquisition. If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions in a timely manner, such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe expect to continue to implement various process improvement initiatives that may not achieve the desired results, thereby potentially reducing our profitability.\nWe have implemented a number of changes designed to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. We expect to continue to identify opportunities for operational efficiencies and cost reductions and implement changes to achieve these efficiencies, which could result in significant charges. Such actions may lead to, among other things, the consolidation and integration of products, brands, facilities, functions, systems and processes and/or a reduction of our talent pool and available resources, any or all of which might present significant management challenges. There can be no assurance that such actions will be accomplished as rapidly as anticipated or that the full extent of expected cost reductions will be achieved.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a decrease in the availability of commercial paper or other forms of credit or an increase in our cost of capital.\nWe had $145 of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2014. If the market for commercial paper or other forms of credit becomes restricted or unavailable, or our cost of capital significantly increases due to a credit rating downgrade, an economic downturn or uncertainty or other factors, our business could be adversely affected, including our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n- 13 -\nOur sales and operating results may vary from the guidance we publish and from period to period.\nOur sales and operating results may vary significantly from the guidance we publish, from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including, without limitation, those previously identified within other risk factors and the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing of our cost of products and services sold, R&D, sales and marketing expenses and other charges;\n\u2022\nthe timing of significant custom sales orders, typically associated with our SAFC Commercial business;\n\u2022\nthe expected higher level of sales growth in our SAFC Commercial business creating downward pressure on overall gross profit margins;\n\u2022\nan increase in the sale of commoditized Research products creating downward pressure on overall gross profit margins;\n\u2022\nchanges in GAAP; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated loss of market value of the securities we hold.\nOur expense levels are based in part on our future sales expectations. Consequently, sales or profits may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, and sales and profits in any interim period may not be indicative of results in subsequent periods.\nWe have significant inventories on hand.\nWe maintain significant inventories and have an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory. Any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including the current uncertainty in the global market, could also have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, if it would become necessary to rework product to make it saleable, this additional effort would impact our costs and operating results.\nWe may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives that would reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to ASC Topic 350 which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives represented approximately 18 percent of our total assets. If we determine that there has been an impairment, our financial results for the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. There were no indicators of impairment as of December 31, 2014.\nOur share price will fluctuate.\nBoth the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock will continue to be subject to fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nthe financial performance of the major end markets that we target;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets; and\n\u2022\nfailure to consummate the pending Merck KGaA transaction.\nDividends on our common stock and share repurchases could change in the future.\nIn 2014, we paid annual dividends of $0.92 per share and had repurchased a total of 102 million shares of common stock, and in 2013, we paid annual dividends of $0.86 per share and had repurchased a total of 101 million shares of common stock. The Company does not currently anticipate repurchasing any additional stock following expiration of our stock repurchase program authorization in November 2014 and due to the pending Merck KGaA transaction. Similarly, in our agreement with Merck KGaA, we agreed not to increase our dividend above current levels. The failure to maintain or pay dividends or repurchase shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n- 14 -", "PERMNO": 70536, "SIC": 2833, "TIC": "SIAL"}
