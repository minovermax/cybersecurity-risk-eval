{"cik": "1065087", "company": "ALBANY MOLECULAR RESEARCH INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our customers\u2019 spending on and demand for our manufacturing and development services. A decrease in their spending or demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that use our services for a large portion of our revenues. Although there has been a trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource drug research, development and manufacturing functions, this trend may not continue. We have experienced increasing pressure on the part of our customers to reduce expenses, including the use of our services, as a result of negative economic trends generally and more specifically in the pharmaceutical industry.\nIn addition, the amount that customers are able to spend on our services will depend upon, among other things, their access to capital and their need to develop new products, which is influenced by underlying consumer demand for their products, competitors\u2019 initiatives, market response and reimbursement rates. Any reduction in customer spending as a result of these factors or from general economic and/or pharmaceutical industry downturns could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, earnings and financial condition..\nOur services and offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer.\nThe services we offer are highly complex. Our operating results depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether.\nIn addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, APIs or other raw materials, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, and monetary sanctions.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAll facilities and manufacturing techniques used to manufacture APIs and drug product for clinical use or for commercial sale in the United States are subject to extensive ongoing regulation, including cGMP and drug safety standards that are established by the FDA and similar standards established by regulatory authorities in other countries, as well as for some facilities, regulations imposed by the DEA. The FDA and other regulatory authorities conduct unscheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our compliance with regulatory standards. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution, restrictions on our operations, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant and adversely affect our results of operations. Any adverse action by the FDA or other applicable regulatory bodies or any failure by us to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results.\nIf we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire, or in managing our divestitures, our business may suffer.\nDuring the past few years, we have significantly expanded our business through acquisitions, including the acquisition of Gadea in 2015 and Euticals in 2016. Our future success depends in part on our ability to acquire additional businesses and technologies that complement, enhance or expand our current business or offerings and we therefore plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies, as strategic opportunities present themselves. However, we may face competition from other companies in pursuing such acquisitions and businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions that we find acceptable. We risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition partners, but not completing transactions.\nEven if completed, acquisitions involve numerous risks which may include:\n\u00b7 difficulties, resources and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations, services, products or technologies, including supplier, distribution, employee and customer relationships;\n\u00b7 challenges with developing and operating new businesses, including those which may be materially different from our existing businesses and which may require the development or acquisition of new internal capabilities and expertise;\n\u00b7 diversion of management's attention from the Company\u2019s existing core business, resulting in the loss of key customers or personnel;\n\u00b7 potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller;\n\u00b7 acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the ownership of our existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nLoss of key employees of the acquired business;\n\u00b7 risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices, customs and importation regulations, language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies;\n\u00b7 risks that disagreements or disputes with prior owners of an acquired business, technology, service or product may result in litigation expenses and diversion of our management's attention;\n\u00b7 absence of adequate internal controls or occurrence of fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies; and\n\u00b7 risk that the initial objectives for the acquisition may not remain viable due to variety of factors, including regulatory changes.\nIn the event that any of the above occur or the acquired business or technology does not otherwise meet our expectations or perform in accordance with historical periods, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSome of the same risks exist when we decide to exit or sell a business, site, or product line. In addition, divestitures could involve additional risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, including obtaining any necessary consents from customers or relevant regulatory agencies; and\n\u00b7 the need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture.\nWe continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of our businesses and operating facilities. Moreover, in connection with our business acquisitions, we have undertaken, and may continue to undertake, restructuring plans relating to reductions in force and other transition activities. Such restructurings and any other divestitures of non-strategic businesses or assets may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner. To the extent we are not successful in completing our planned divestitures or restructuring efforts, we may have to expend significant cash, incur debt and continue to absorb under-performing divisions. If we are unable to manage these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business, site or product line, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the divestiture which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may experience disruptions in or the inability to source raw materials to support our production processes or to deliver goods to our customers.\nWe rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials, consisting primarily of various chemicals. While we generally use raw materials available from more than one source and do not enter into long-term contracts for such materials, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice, which could lead to delays and to raw materials being purchased on less favorable terms than we have with our regular supplier. Under the terms of our contracts, we may not be able to pass additional expense for raw materials along to our customers and therefore such increases may impact our results of operations. Additionally, we rely on various third-party delivery services to transport both supplies from our vendors and finished products to our customers. A disruption in our ability to source or transport materials could delay or halt production and delivery of certain of our products thereby adversely impacting our ability to comply with the terms of our contracts, which could result in breach of contract claims, financial penalties or customers terminating such contracts entirely.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a small group of customers. We may lose one or more of our major customers.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from GE Healthcare, our largest customer, represented approximately 7% of our contract and total revenue. Our existing agreement with GE Healthcare extends through 2018. In total, our five largest customers in 2016 represented approximately 22% of our contract and total revenue. This customer concentration increases credit risk and other risks associated with particular customers and particular products, including risks related to market demand for such products and regulatory risks. In addition, these customers, along with most of our other customers, typically may cancel their contracts with 30 days\u2019 to two-years\u2019 prior notice, depending on the size of the contract, for a variety of reasons, some of which are beyond our control. The loss or a significant reduction in business from any of our major customers could materially decrease our contract revenues and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness, we may fail to meet our current credit facility\u2019s financial covenants and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could each adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $683.5 million of indebtedness outstanding. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek to raise additional capital or take other similar actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions.\nOur Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \u201cConvertible Senior Notes\u201d) come due in the first half of 2018, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay these notes. If we are unable to pay the principal on our Convertible Senior Notes, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional securities to generate funds to cover these payments. In addition, in the event of a default under the Convertible Senior Notes, the holders and/or the trustee under the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes may accelerate the payment obligations thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility could become due and payable on an accelerated basis under certain conditions and in certain circumstances. For a further discussion of our indebtedness, please see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would likely have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks or recovery ratings, can affect the availability of financing options for the Company, increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position. In addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u00b7 expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u00b7 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u00b7 limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. Also, under our Convertible Senior Notes, we are required to offer to repurchase the convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which could include, among other things, any acquisition of our Company for consideration other than publicly traded securities. The repurchase price must be paid in cash, and this obligation may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an acquisition of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.\nRestrictions under our credit agreement may prevent us from obtaining additional sources of funding that we may require to advance certain of our business objectives.\nDuring 2016, in connection with the Euticals Acquisition, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Barclays Bank PLC. The Credit Agreement contains customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that may restrict us from:\n\u00b7 incurring additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 paying dividends on or repurchasing our capital stock;\n\u00b7 making investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 creating liens;\n\u00b7 selling assets;\n\u00b7 guaranteeing indebtedness;\n\u00b7 engaging in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 consolidating, merging or transferring all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur ability to comply with these restrictive covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under our Credit Agreement and payment of the indebtedness could be accelerated. In addition, complying with these covenants may preclude us from obtaining additional sources of financing in the short-term and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nWe face increased competition.\nWe compete with other contract development manufacturing organizations, clinical research organizations, large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity, laboratories and research and academic institutions. We compete on a variety of factors, including: quality, regulatory compliance, expertise, scope and breadth of services, reliability, price, value and manufacturing flexibility.\nWe also experience significant competition from foreign companies operating under lower cost structures, primarily those in China, India and other Asian countries. While we operate in certain lower relative cost jurisdictions, such as India , we do not have operations in China. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. As new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available, we currently expect to face increased competition. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies may elect to provide their development and manufacturing services internally rather than outsource those functions to us or any of our competitors.\nIn the future, any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide less desirable or obsolete. In order to compete, we must properly anticipate our customers\u2019 needs and enhance, innovate and develop new, more cost-efficient services. We may not be able to develop the services we need to successfully compete in the future, and our competitors may be able to develop such services before we do or provide those services at a lower cost. Consequently, we may lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers, which would materially harm our financial condition and prospects.\nAlong with significant property and equipment balances, we have a significant and increasing amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded on our balance sheet, mainly related to our acquisitions, which may lead to potentially significant impairment charges.\nWe review long-lived assets, including goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable based on the existence of certain triggering events. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are also subject to an impairment assessment at least annually. The amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheet has increased significantly as a result of acquisitions. At December 31, 2016, the total goodwill related to DDS, API and DP was $52.0 million, $104.6 million and $74.7 million, respectively, and total intangible assets and patents recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $165.2 million.\nFactors we consider important which could result in long-lived asset impairment include the following:\n\u00b7 a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset group is being used;\n\u00b7 a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset group; and\n\u00b7 a significant decrease in the market value of assets.\nIf long-lived assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we would be required to record a charge to our results of earnings, which would have a material, adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our technology and proprietary information, our business could be materially harmed.\nSome of the most valuable assets of the Company include patents. We seek patent protection with respect to products and processes developed in the course of our activities when we believe such protection is in our best interest and when the cost of seeking such protection is justifiable. We cannot be assured that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patent are issued, they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities. There can be no assurance that these protections will prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. In an effort to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of our information, such as trade secrets, proprietary information and other confidential information, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Furthermore, we may from time to time hire scientific personnel formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities we conduct. In some situations, our confidentiality and proprietary information agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships. Although we require our employees and consultants to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information of their previous employers, these individuals, or we, may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations.\nIn addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques causing some technologies that we develop to be patented by other companies. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit our ability to compete effectively and our investment in those technologies may not yield the benefits we expected. In connection with our collaboration activities, we or our partner may seek approval to market a generic product before the expiration of patents for that product, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by our products. In these cases and others, we could be subject to claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others. We could incur significant costs defending such claims and if we are unsuccessful in defending these claims, we may be subject to liability for infringement and could be required, among other things, to discontinue the use of the infringing technology, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, license such technology from the third party claiming infringement and/or cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing processes or offerings. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, these proceedings could result in substantial cost. The filing and prosecution of patent applications, litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents, assertion of patent infringement claims against others and the defense of patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time consuming.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, we may be subject to claims.\nMany of the formulations and processes used by us in manufacturing or developing products to customer specifications are subject to trade secret protection, patents or other protections owned or licensed by the relevant customer. We take significant efforts to protect our customers\u2019 proprietary and confidential information, including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information. If, however, any of our employees breaches the non-disclosure provisions in such agreements, or if our customers make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed, this could damage our reputation, subject us to legal proceedings and significant expense and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to manage our business to consistent profitability without Allegra and/or other royalties will have a significant impact on our operations, financial condition and stock value.\nThe recurring royalties we received on the sales of Allegra/Telfast historically provided a material portion of our revenue, earnings and operating cash flows. These royalties ceased in May 2015. Recurring royalties have significantly higher margins than do our other business activities, resulting in the need to replace a significant amount of margin in order to achieve the same level of profitability. While recently we have begun to receive royalties on the sales of other products in connection with our collaboration arrangement activities, we must continue to develop our business and manage our operating costs in order to operate profitably. In recent years, we have acquired revenue-generating businesses, including Euticals and Gadea, that are expected to produce consistent and growing revenue and profit over time and have effected certain cost saving measures in order to support the profitability that is achievable from our core contract research and manufacturing businesses. In the future, we may need to take additional cost cutting measures if our revenues do not continue to increase or are not profitable enough to support our operations. If we are unable to do so, there will be a material and adverse impact on our business, including negative impact on our operating cash flow, access to capital and ability to implement required capital improvements to our facilities.\nOur sales forecast and/or revenue projections may not be accurate.\nWe use a backlog system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of proposals, including the date when they estimate a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential size of the order. We aggregate these estimates on a quarterly basis in order to generate a sales backlog. While this process provides us with some guidance in business planning and forecasting, it is based on estimates only and is therefore subject to risks and uncertainties. We believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons. First, contracts vary in duration, and as such the timing and amount of revenues recognized from backlog can vary from period to period. Second, certain of our manufacturing and services contracts are of a nature that a customer may, at its option, cancel or delay the timing of delivery, which would change our projections concerning the timing and extent to which revenue may be recognized. Moreover, the volume of product under each contract is subject to change, sometimes, significantly, based on the expected forecast volume required by our customers. In addition, the value of our services contracts that are conducted on a time and materials or full-time equivalent basis are based on estimates, from which actual revenue generated could vary. Finally, there is no assurance that projects included in backlog will not be terminated or delayed at any time by customers or regulatory authorities. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year. Any variation in the conversion of the backlog into revenue or the backlog itself could cause us to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDelays in, or failure to obtain, the approval of our customers\u2019 regulatory submissions could impact our revenue and earnings.\nThe successful transition of preclinical and clinical candidates into long term commercial supply agreements is a key component of the Drug Product and API business strategy. If our customers do not receive approval for their products from the applicable regulatory authorities, this could have a significant negative impact on our revenue and earnings. In addition, the manufacture of controlled substances requires timely approval by the DEA of sufficient controlled substance quota. If we do not receive sufficient DEA quota to meet our customers\u2019 demands, and/or if our customers do not receive sufficient quota to take delivery of and/or formulate the product at their facilities, this could have a significant negative impact on our revenue and earnings.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks.\nOur global business operations give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors. These foreign market risks were further heightened following our recent acquisitions of Euticals, with operations in Italy, Germany and France and Gadea, with operations in Spain. While we have derivative financial instruments in place as appropriate to mitigate certain of our foreign exchange risk, these hedges may not be successful and they do not fully cover the foreign currency exposure that results from the operation of the entire business. If we fail to effectively manage such risks, it could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements. For a further discussion of our foreign currency risks, please see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nOur business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally.\nWe have significant international operations, particularly following the acquisitions of Gadea and Euticals. As a result, a significant part of our contract revenue is derived from operations outside the U.S. Our international revenues, which include revenues from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, have represented approximately 47%, 36% and 32% of our total contract revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. We currently have operations in eight countries. There are a number of risks associated with our international business including:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7 potential international conflicts, including terrorist acts;\n\u00b7 potential trade restrictions, exchange controls, adverse tax consequences, and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the U.S.;\n\u00b7 difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of work stoppages and/or strikes, as well as violations of local laws or anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of US and foreign tax laws and particularly any changes in tax laws affecting any repatriation of profits;\n\u00b7 exposure to business disruption or property damage due to geographically unique natural disasters;\n\u00b7 longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and\n\u00b7 import and export licensing requirements.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, as mentioned above, we are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a non-binding referendum, in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The Brexit referendum may impact our relationship with foreign customers and the operations of our European facilities, and expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and heightened volatility in our stock price due to reactions in global markets. The Brexit referendum constituted an advisory, non-binding vote, and its full impact is subject to the results of following the two-year negotiation period from the date of on which the British government commences formal withdrawal proceedings.\nIn December 2016, the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, resigned his position. If the new government calls for a referendum on Italy\u2019s membership in the European Union and such an exit is approved, this could have a significant adverse impact on our API operations in Italy. Such an exit could increase regulatory costs and the abandonment of the euro could adversely affect pricing and profitability, which would provide competitive advantages to API manufacturers outside of Italy. Following the Euticals Acquisition, we have significant API operations in Italy and our business could therefore be materially adversely impacted by such a withdrawal.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our senior management and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur business is highly dependent on our senior management, including William Marth, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and George Svokos, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Although we have formal employment agreements with our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nOur future growth and profitability also depends upon the research and efforts of our highly skilled employees, such as our scientists, and their ability to keep pace with changes in drug discovery and development technologies. We compete with pharmaceutical firms, biotechnology firms, contract research firms, and academic and research institutions to recruit scientists. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. If we cannot retain such scientists and other highly skilled employees, or attract additional qualified employees, we will not be able to continue our existing services and will not be able to expand the services we offer to our customers.\nFurthermore, retaining and motivating key personnel from our recent acquisitions who will be instrumental in integrating our businesses will be important to our ability to successfully achieve our business objectives.\nWe are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe employ approximately 3,100 employees worldwide. Some of our employees are represented by labor organizations and national works councils. Our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. However, further organizing activities or collective bargaining may increase our employment-related costs and we may be subject to work stoppages and other labor disruptions. Moreover, if we are subject to employment-related claims, such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, wage-hour and labor standards issues, and such actions are successful in whole or in part, this may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be held liable for harm caused by drugs that we develop and test.\nWe develop, test and manufacture drugs that are used by humans. If any of the drugs that we develop, test or manufacture harm people, we may be named as a defendant in a product liability lawsuit, which could be costly to defend and could result in significant liability and divert management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. Although we have generally sought to mitigate this risk through liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors, we may nevertheless be required to pay damages and such amounts may be in excess of the amounts of our insurance coverage or excluded from coverage entirely. Product liability claims and lawsuits, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use.\nOur manufacturing and research and development processes involve the use of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials, chemicals and substances. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulation governing the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of such materials, including but not limited to radioactive compounds and certain waste products. Additionally, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and emissions and wastewater discharges. Although we believe that our activities currently comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. We may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury. In addition, we cannot predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative actions, and therefore we could be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations which could restrict our operations in the future. Such expenses, liabilities or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe have been required to conduct remediation activities, including ongoing monitoring and reporting, at certain of our facilities. It is the Company\u2019s policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters where remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on the Company\u2019s best estimate of the future costs required to complete the remedial work. Environmental matters often span several years and frequently involve regulatory oversight or adjudication. Additionally, many remediation efforts are fluid and are likely to be affected by future technology, site and regulatory developments. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these liabilities will be materially higher than the Company has estimated. In addition, our operations have grown through acquisitions, and it is possible that facilities that we have acquired may expose us to environmental liabilities associated with historical site conditions that have not yet been discovered. If such remediation costs or claims were to arise, they may be material and may not be recoverable under any contractual indemnity or otherwise from prior owners or operators or any insurance policy.\nOur operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our facilities.\nWe depend on our laboratories, manufacturing facilities and equipment for the continued operation of our business. Our research and development, manufacturing and administrative functions are primarily conducted at our facilities in Albany and Rensselaer, New York, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Valladolid, Spain, Milan, Italy, Grafton, Wisconsin, and Burlington, Massachusetts. Although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, these events could still disrupt our operations. For example, in 2014, our facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico experienced a power failure which resulted in certain business interruption losses. Even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event at any of our facilities could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nTerrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business.\nTerrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our Company, our employees, our facilities and our customers, which could significantly impact our revenues, costs and expenses and financial condition. The increasing potential for terrorist attacks over the past several years, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nOur systems and networks may be subject to cyber security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise our information, interrupt our operations and harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we rely heavily upon our technology systems and networks to input, maintain and communicate the confidential and proprietary data we receive on behalf of our customers, to facilitate the manufacture of inventory, to receive and process orders of product, to manage the billing and collections from our customers and to generally operate our global network of manufacturing and development facilities. Our security measures could be compromised and, as a result, our data, customers\u2019 data, information technology or infrastructure could be accessed improperly, made unavailable or improperly modified, or our servers could be attacked or corrupted by computer hackers, nefarious actors, computer viruses or other malicious software programs or breached due to employee error or malfeasance, all of which could create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. In addition, subcontractors, partners or other third party vendors that receive or utilize confidential information on our behalf may become subject to a security breach, which may result in unauthorized access to such third party\u2019s information systems and/or our or our customers\u2019 protected information. The occurrence of any of these events could cause our infrastructure to be perceived as vulnerable, cause our customers to lose confidence in our services and to terminate or not renew their agreements with us, damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, all of which could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. Similarly, if our internal networks are compromised, we could be adversely affected by the loss of proprietary, trade secret or confidential technical and financial data. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. We could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a cybersecurity breach, including repairing system damage, increasing cyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, paying regulatory fines and and resolving legal claims and regulatory actions, all of which could increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDomestic governmental policy changes, including health care reform and budgetary policies could reduce the reimbursement rates pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies receive for drugs they sell, which in turn, could reduce the demand for our services.\nWe depend on contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a majority of our revenues. We therefore depend upon the ability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to earn enough profit on the drugs they market to drive continued demand for our services and to devote substantial resources to the research and development of new drugs. Additionally, under our long-term collaboration agreements, we rely on our partners to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for current and potential future products developed under those agreements. If they are unable to do so, we may not be able to sell those products on a competitive and profitable basis. Continued efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means could affect our levels of revenues and earnings. In certain foreign markets, pricing and/or profitability of pharmaceutical products are subject to governmental control. Domestically, there have been and may continue to be proposals to implement similar governmental control. Future legislation may limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market and cost control initiatives could affect the amounts that third-party payors agree to reimburse for those drugs. As a result, such laws and initiatives may have the effect of reducing the resources that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs. If pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies decrease the resources they devote to the research and development of new drugs, the amount of services that we perform, and therefore our revenues, could be reduced.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we encounter complications in connection with the upgrade and implementation of our global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, our information technology systems and infrastructure. Upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we implemented a new ERP system at all of our global locations, except our Gadea and Euticals locations. We may implement or upgrade ERP systems at our recently acquired businesses during 2017. The implementation or upgrade of ERP systems affects the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness. In general, the process of planning and preparing for these types of implementations is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion, system cutover and user training. Problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments, missed sales, billing and accounting errors and other operational issues. There have been numerous, well-publicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of ERP systems which resulted in negative business consequences. We rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure, with respect to enterprise resource planning, manufacturing, and the storage of business, financial, intellectual property, and other information essential to the effective operation and management of our business. While we have invested significantly in the operation and protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems. Prolonged interruptions or significant breaches could result in a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our Company is limited, which may not be in every shareholder\u2019s best interests.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7 Establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u00b7 Limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u00b7 Establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u00b7 Require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly-called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u00b7 Limit who may call stockholder meetings; and\nAuthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur officers and directors have significant control over us and their interests as shareholders may differ from our other shareholders.\nAs of March 2, 2017, our directors and officers beneficially owned or controlled approximately 14.8% of our outstanding common stock. Individually and in the aggregate, these stockholders significantly influence our management, affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval. In particular, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing an acquisition of us and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price is volatile and could experience substantial change.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. Our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, our shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of our shareholders\u2019 investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which shareholders purchased their shares.\nWe may experience significant increases in operational costs beyond our control.\nCosts for certain items which are needed to run our business, such as energy and certain materials, have the potential to fluctuate.These cost increases are often dependent on market conditions. Although we do our best to manage these price increases, we may experience increases in our costs due to the volatility of prices and market conditions. Increases in these costs could negatively impact our results of operations to the extent that we are unable to incorporate these increases into the pricing of our goods and services.\nA reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our overall revenue is derived either from governmental sources directly, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d), or indirectly, from customers whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources. A reduction in government funding for the NIH or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results and there is no guarantee that future government funding will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our services.\nAny claims beyond our insurance coverage limits, or that are otherwise not covered by our insurance, may result in substantial costs and a reduction in our available capital resources.\nWe maintain property insurance, employer\u2019s liability insurance, product liability insurance, general liability insurance, business interruption insurance, and directors and officers liability insurance, among others. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage, potential claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles and additional risk to our business and financial condition.\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a multinational business with global operations. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of Italy, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and several other international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, we may not be successful in defending such a challenge and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTax assessments by various tax authorities could be materially different than the amounts we have provided for in our consolidated financial statements. We are regularly audited by various tax authorities. From time to time, these audits could result in proposed assessments. While we believe that we have adequately provided for any such assessments, future settlements could be materially different than we have provided for and thereby have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. We operate in various tax jurisdictions, and although we believe that we have provided for income and other taxes in accordance with the relevant regulations, if the applicable regulations were ultimately interpreted differently by a taxing authority, we could be exposed to additional tax liabilities. While we believe our tax positions, including, among others, intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which could have a significant impact on our tax position.", "PERMNO": 86709, "SIC": 2833, "TIC": "AMRI"}
