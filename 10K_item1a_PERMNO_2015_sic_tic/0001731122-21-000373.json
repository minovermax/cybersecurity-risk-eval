Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties. The following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in us speculative or risk, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors section below. You should read and carefully consider this summary in conjunction with the Risk Factors section as well as the other information included in this Annual Report, including \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report, before investing in our securities. We operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. However, the selected risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In such a case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in us.\n\u25cf Actual or threatened public health crises, epidemics, or outbreaks, including the outbreak of COVID-19, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u25cf Our industry is cyclical and adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for homes and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u25cf If we are not able to develop communities successfully and in a timely manner, our revenues, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\u25cf We may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\n\u25cf Our geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should experience a decline.\n\u25cf Inflation and interest rate changes could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\u25cf We may not be successful in integrating acquisitions, expanding into new markets or implementing our growth strategies.\n\u25cf Landsea Green can determine the outcome of major corporate transactions that require the approval of our stockholders and may take actions that conflict with the interests of other of our stockholders.\n\u25cf We are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, may qualify for, and may choose to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\n\u25cf Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\n\u25cf If the Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\n\u25cf A significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. Resales of the shares of Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\n\u25cf Because homes are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time.\n\u25cf New and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build or delay completion of our projects.\n\u25cf We rely on third-party suppliers and long supply chains, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains, our ability to timely and efficiently access raw materials that meet our standards for quality could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Our business and results of operations are dependent on the availability, skill and performance of subcontractors.\n\u25cf The long-term sustainability and growth in our number of homes delivered depends in part upon our ability to acquire developed lots ready for residential homebuilding on reasonable terms.\nRisk Factors\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\nActual or threatened public health crises, epidemics, or outbreaks, including the outbreak of COVID-19, have had and may again have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business operations and supply chains may be negatively impacted by regional or global public health crises, epidemics, or outbreaks. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On March 11, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has spread rapidly throughout the world and has caused severe disruption to the global economy. The COVID-19 outbreak has led governments across the globe to impose a series of measures intended to contain its spread, including border closures, travel bans, quarantine measures, social distancing, and restrictions on business operations and large gatherings. Such measures have adversely impacted our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a significant public health crisis, epidemic or outbreak of contagious disease in the human population may adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, including those in which we operate, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the supply or demand for our products and services.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has caused companies like us and our business partners to implement temporary adjustments to work schedules and travel plans, allowing employees to work from home and collaborate remotely. As a result, we have experienced lower efficiency and productivity, internally and externally, which may adversely affect our service quality. Moreover, our business depends on our employees and the continued services of these individuals. If an employee contracts or is suspected of having contracted COVID-19, such an employee is required under our policies to be quarantined. That employee could expose and transmit to other employees, potentially resulting in severe disruption to our business.\nFurthermore, our results of operations have been severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in significant slowing and/or ceasing of construction, sales, warranty, and administrative support in our markets. In addition, depending on the specific jurisdiction, we are required to implement certain safety protocols and procedures that have materially impacted our ability to develop communities, maintain sales velocity, build homes, timely deliver homes, and service customers. The COVID-19 outbreak has had, and future outbreaks can have, a material impact on cycle times, cancellation rates, availability of trades, costs, supplies, and new home demand.\nMore broadly, the COVID-19 outbreak threatens global economies and may cause significant market volatility and declines in general economic activities. This may severely dampen investor confidence in global markets, resulting in decreases in overall trading activities and restraint in their investment decisions.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will impact our operations depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, actions taken by government authorities or other entities to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, including vaccines, and volatility in the capital and real estate markets, among others. Given the general slowdown in economic conditions globally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop new products and services in a timely manner or that we can maintain the growth rate we have previously experienced or projected. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the response to it at this time. In addition, COVID-19 may foster or worsen the occurrence of any of the other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report.\nIf we are not able to develop communities successfully and in a timely manner, our revenues, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire land, obtain or renew permits and development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. There may be a significant lag from the time we acquire land or options for land for development or developed home sites and the time we can bring the communities to market and sell homes. Our ability to process a significant number of transactions (which include, among other things, evaluating the site purchase, designing the layout of the development, sourcing materials and subcontractors and managing contractual commitments) efficiently and accurately is important to our success. Errors by employees, failure to comply with or changes in regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules, failings or inadequacies in internal control processes, equipment failures, natural disasters or the failure of external systems, including those of suppliers or counterparties, could result in delays and operational issues that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and relationships with customers. We can also experience significant delays in obtaining permits, development approvals, entitlements, and local, state or federal government approvals (including due to an extended failure by lawmakers to agree on a budget or appropriation legislation to fund relevant operations or programs), utility company constraints or delays, delays in a land seller\u2019s lot deliveries or delays resulting from rights or claims asserted by third parties, which may be outside of our control. Additionally, we may also have to renew existing permits and there can be no assurances that these permits will be renewed. Delays in the development of communities also expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nWe are subject to warranty and liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect, product liability, home warranty, and other claims, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. There can be no assurance that our general liability insurance and other insurance rights or the indemnification arrangements with subcontractors and design professionals and other indemnities will be collectible or adequate to cover any or all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be liable. Some claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. We may not be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates and may incur significant costs or expenses (including repair costs and litigation expenses) surrounding possible construction defects, product liability claims, soil subsidence or building related claims. Some claims may arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance or that are not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our trade partners. In addition, we typically act as the general contractor for the homes we build for third party landowners on fee. In connection with these fee building agreements, we indemnify the landowner for liabilities arising from our work. There can be no assurance that our general liability insurance (procured by us or the landowner) or indemnification arrangements with subcontractors will be collectible and some claims may arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance. Furthermore, most insurance policies have some level of a self-insured retention that we are required to satisfy per occurrence in order to access the underlying insurance, which levels can be significant. Any such claims or self-insured retentions can be costly and could result in significant liability.\nWith respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defects and related claims and product liability claims, interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process require us to exercise significant judgment due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure often exhibiting unique circumstances. Furthermore, once claims are asserted against us for construction defects, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand. Plaintiffs may seek to consolidate multiple parties in one lawsuit or seek class action status in some of these legal proceedings with potential class sizes that vary from case to case. Consolidated and class action lawsuits can be costly to defend and, if we were to lose any consolidated or certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability.\nWe also expend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we have issued to homebuyers. Additionally, construction defect claims can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system. Warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet, which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes.\nIn addition, we conduct much of our business in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious jurisdictions in the United States, which imposes a ten-year, strict liability tail on many construction liability claims. As a result, our potential losses and expenses due to litigation, new laws and regulations may be greater than those of competitors who have smaller California operations as a percentage of the total enterprise.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nIn addition to difficulties with respect to claim assessment and liability and reserve estimation, some types of claims may not be covered by our insurance or may exceed our applicable coverage limits. We may also be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions with respect to our insurance policies. Furthermore, contractual indemnities with contractors and subcontractors can be difficult to enforce and we include our subcontractors on our general liability insurance which may significantly limit our ability to seek indemnity for insured claims. Furthermore, any product liability or warranty claims made against us, whether or not they are viable, may lead to negative publicity, which could impact our reputation and future home sales. In addition, manufactured product defects may result in delays, additional costs and remediation efforts which could have a negative impact on our new home deliveries and financial and operating results.\nOur insurance for construction defect claims, subject to applicable self-insurance retentions, may not be available or adequate to cover all liability for damages, the cost of repairs, or the expense of litigation surrounding current claims, and future claims may arise out of events or circumstances not covered by our insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with subcontractors.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, indemnity arrangements and reserves will be adequate to cover liability for any damages, the cost of repairs and litigation, or any other related expenses surrounding the current claims to which we are subject or any future claims that may arise. Such damages and expenses, to the extent that they are not covered by our insurance or redress against contractors and subcontractors, could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements and results.\nThe long-term sustainability and growth in our number of homes delivered depends in part upon our ability to acquire developed lots ready for residential homebuilding on reasonable terms.\nOur future growth depends upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire attractive lots ready for development of homes at reasonable prices and with terms that meet our underwriting criteria. Our ability to acquire lots for new homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of lots, the willingness of land sellers to sell lots at reasonable prices, competition for available lots, availability of financing to acquire lots, zoning and other market conditions. We currently depend primarily on the California and greater Phoenix area markets and the availability of lots in those markets at reasonable prices is limited. If the supply of lots appropriate for development of homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow could be significantly limited, and the number of homes that we build and sell could decline. Additionally, our ability to begin new projects could be impacted if we elect not to purchase lots under option contracts. To the extent that we are unable to purchase lots timely or enter into new contracts for the purchase of lots at reasonable prices, our home sales revenue and results of operations could be negatively impacted or we may be required to decrease our operations in a given market.\nIf the market value of our developed lot inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs.\nThe market value of our land and housing inventories depends on market conditions. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets. There is an inherent risk that the value of the land we own or control may decline after purchase. The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land parcels increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. As a result, we may buy and develop land parcels on which homes cannot be profitably built and sold. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. When market conditions drive land values down, land we have purchased or option agreements we have previously entered into may become less desirable because we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably, at which time we may elect to sell the land or, in the case of options contracts, to forego pre-acquisition costs and forfeit deposits and terminate the agreements. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject the market value of land owned, controlled or optioned by us to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired the inventory, our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we build and sell houses.\nRisks associated with our developed lot inventories could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nLand parcels, building lots and housing inventories are illiquid assets, and we may not be able to dispose of them efficiently or at all if we or the housing market and general economy are in financial distress. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market. We regularly review the value of our land holdings and continues to review our holdings on a periodic basis. Material impairments in the value of our inventory may be required, and we may in the future sell land or homes at significantly lower margins or at a loss, if we are able to sell them at all, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in our cancellation rate may adversely impact our revenue and homebuilding margins.\nIn connection with the sale of a home, we collect a deposit from the homebuyer that is a small percentage of the total purchase price. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Landsea Homes experienced cancellation rates of 12.7% and 12.4%, respectively. Cancellations negatively impact the number of closed homes, net new home orders, home sales revenue and our results of operations, as well as the number of homes in backlog. Home order cancellations can result from a number of factors, including but not limited to declines or slow appreciation in the market value of homes, increases in the supply of homes available to be purchased, increased competition, higher mortgage interest rates, buyer\u2019s remorse, homebuyers\u2019 inability to sell their existing homes, homebuyers\u2019 inability to obtain suitable financing, including providing sufficient down payments, and adverse changes in economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Increased levels of home order cancellations would have a negative impact on our home sales revenue and financial and operating results.\nThird-party lenders may not complete mortgage loan originations for our homebuyers in a timely manner or at all, which can lead to cancellations and a lesser backlog of orders, or significant delays in our closing homes sales and recognizing revenues from those homes.\nOur buyers may obtain mortgage financing for their home purchases from any lender or other provider of their choice, including an unaffiliated lender. If, due to credit or consumer lending market conditions, regulatory requirements, or other factors or business decisions, these lenders refuse or are unable to provide mortgage loans to our buyers, the number of homes that we deliver and our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe can provide no assurance as to a lenders\u2019 ability or willingness to complete, in a timely fashion or at all, the mortgage loan originations they start for our homebuyers. Such inability or unwillingness may result in mortgage loan funding issues that slow deliveries of our homes or cause cancellations, which in each case may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, recent changes to mortgage loan disclosure requirements to consumers may potentially delay lenders\u2019 completion of the mortgage loan funding process for borrowers. Specifically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has adopted a rule governing the content and timing of mortgage loan disclosures to borrowers, commonly known as TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures (\u201cTRID\u201d). Lender compliance with TRID could result in delays in loan closings and the delivery of homes that materially and adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nDifficulties with appraisal valuations in relation to the proposed sales price of our homes could force us to reduce the price of our homes for sale.\nEach of our home sales may require an appraisal of the home value before closing. These appraisals are professional judgments of the market value of the property and are based on a variety of market factors. If our internal valuations of the market and pricing do not line up with the appraisal valuations and appraisals are not at or near the agreed upon sales price, we may be forced to reduce the sales price of the home to complete the sale. These appraisal issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on the availability, skill and performance of subcontractors.\nOur business and results of operations are dependent on the availability and skill of subcontractors, as substantially all construction work is done by subcontractors with us acting as the general contractor. Accordingly, the timing and quality of construction depend on the availability and skill of unaffiliated, third party subcontractors. As the homebuilding market returns to full capacity, we have previously experienced and may again experience skilled labor shortages. Throughout the homebuilding cycle, we have experienced shortages of skilled labor in a number of our markets which has led to increased labor costs and increased the cycle times of completion of home construction and our ability to convert home sales into closings. The cost of labor may also be adversely affected by shortages of qualified tradespeople, changes in laws and regulations relating to union activity and changes in immigration laws and trends in labor migration. We cannot be assured that there will be a sufficient supply of, or satisfactory performance by, these unaffiliated third-party consultants and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe residential construction industry also experiences labor shortages and disruptions from time to time, including: work stoppages, labor disputes, shortages in qualified tradespeople, lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services, our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured, and delays in availability of building materials. Additionally, we could experience labor shortages as a result of subcontractors going out of business or leaving the residential construction market due to low levels of housing production and volumes. Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of our communities, increase the cost of developing one or more of our communities and increase the construction cost of our homes. To the extent that market conditions prevent the recovery of increased costs, including, among other things, subcontracted labor, finished lots, building materials, and other resources, through higher sales prices, our gross margins from home sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, some of the subcontractors we engage are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements that require the payment of prevailing wages that are typically higher than normally expected on a residential construction site. A strike or other work stoppage involving any of our subcontractors could also make it difficult for us to retain subcontractors for their construction work. In addition, union activity could result in higher costs for us to retain our subcontractors. Access to qualified labor at reasonable rates may also be affected by other circumstances beyond our control, including: shortages of qualified tradespeople, such as carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers; high inflation; changes in laws relating to employment and union organizing activity; changes in trends in labor force migration; and increases in contractor, subcontractor and professional services costs. The inability to contract with skilled contractors and subcontractors at reasonable rates on a timely basis could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, the enactment and implementation of federal, state or local statutes, ordinances, rules or regulations requiring the payment of prevailing wages on private residential developments would materially increase our costs of development and construction, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and long supply chains, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains, our ability to timely and efficiently access raw materials that meet our standards for quality could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our standards for quality and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. We may be required to replace a supplier if their products do not meet our quality or safety standards. In addition, our suppliers could discontinue selling products at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the suppliers\u2019 control. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a supplier providing similar products. Our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver products may also be affected by financing constraints caused by credit market conditions, which could negatively impact our revenue and cost of products sold, at least until alternate sources of supply are arranged.\nFluctuating materials prices may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe residential construction industry experiences labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople, and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the regions in which we operate experience natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. The cost of labor and raw materials may also increase during periods of shortage or high inflation. During the downturn in 2007 to 2011, a large number of qualified trade partners went out of business or otherwise exited the market into new fields. A reduction in available trade partners exacerbates labor shortages as demand for new housing increases. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which we may not be able to recover by raising home prices due to market demand and because the price for each home is typically set prior to its delivery pursuant to the agreement of sale with the homebuyer. In addition, the federal government has, at various times, imposed tariffs on a variety of imports from foreign countries and may impose additional tariffs in the future. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on raw materials that we use in our homebuilding operation, such as lumber or steel, could cause the cost of home construction to increase, which we may not be able to recover by raising home prices or which could slow our absorption due to being constrained by market demand. As a result, shortages or increased costs of labor and raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by efforts to impose joint employer liability for labor law violations committed by subcontractors.\nSeveral other homebuilders have received inquiries from regulatory agencies concerning whether homebuilders using contractors are deemed to be employers of the employees of such contractors under certain circumstances. Contractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the homebuilding industry; however, if regulatory agencies reclassify the employees of contractors as employees of homebuilders, homebuilders using contractors could be responsible for wage and hour labor laws, workers\u2019 compensation and other employment-related liabilities of their contractors. Even if we are not deemed to be a joint employer with our contractors, we may be subject to legislation that requires us to share liability with our contractors for the payment of wages and the failure to secure valid workers\u2019 compensation coverage. In addition, under California law, direct construction contractors are required to assume and be liable for unpaid wages, fringe or other benefit payments or contributions, including interest, incurred by a subcontractor at any tier for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2018, which may result in increased costs.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquisitions, expanding into new markets or implementing our growth strategies.\nIn June 2019, Landsea Homes closed the acquisition of Arizona-based homebuilders Pinnacle West, in the greater Phoenix area market, and in January 2020, Landsea Homes closed the acquisition of Garrett Walker, increasing our footprint in the greater Phoenix area market. We may in the future consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in new markets, whether through strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies or otherwise. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future expansion will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Our expansion into new or existing markets, whether through acquisition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company\u2019s operations, the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities or expenses, the risk of impairing inventory and other assets related to the acquisition, the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other business concerns, risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and growth.\nWe may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth. Our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our continued development or growth.\nAdverse weather and geological conditions may increase costs, cause project delays and reduce consumer demand for housing, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a homebuilder and land developer, we are subject to the risks associated with numerous weather-related and geologic events, many of which are beyond our control. These weather-related and geologic events include but are not limited to droughts, floods, wildfires, landslides, soil subsidence and earthquakes. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our land parcels and projects, cause delays in the completion of our projects, reduce consumer demand for housing and cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, any of which could harm our sales and profitability. Our California markets are in areas which have historically experienced significant earthquake activity, seasonal wildfires and related power outages, droughts and water shortages. In addition to directly damaging our land or projects, earthquakes, floods, landslides, wildfires or other geologic events could damage roads and highways providing access to those projects, thereby adversely affecting our ability to market homes in those areas and possibly increasing the costs of completion.\nFailure by our directors, officers or employees to comply with applicable policies, regulations and rules could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have adopted an employee handbook, which includes policies, regulations and rules, for our directors, officers and employees. Our adoption of these policies, regulations and rules is not a representation or warranty that all persons subject to such standards are or will be in complete compliance. The failure of a director, officer or employee to comply with the applicable policies, regulations and rules may result in termination of the relationship or adverse publicity, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur officers and directors may allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs.\nOur officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. Some of our officers and directors are engaged in other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenue or results of operations to decline.\nResidents of communities we develop may look to us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts we make to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents, and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect our sales or reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may write-off intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nWe have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with the acquisitions of Pinnacle West and Garrett Walker Homes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the value of intangible assets. As circumstances change, we can make no assurances that we will realize the value of these intangible assets. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we will be required to write-off the impaired portion of intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nMoreover, factors outside of our business and outside of our control may later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to write down or write off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Further, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. Accordingly, our securities could suffer a reduction in value. Our securityholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value, unless stockholders are able to successfully claim that the reduction in stock value was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to bring a private claim that the proxy statement relating to the Business Combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nOur business or financial results may be adversely affected if the value of the land we purchase declines. We have, and may continue, to incur impairments on the carrying values of the real estate inventories we own.\nThere are inherent risks in controlling, owning and developing land, as housing inventories are illiquid assets. We own land or homesites that were acquired at costs we may not be able to recover fully, or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably, including but not limited to periods of reduced housing demand. This is particularly true when entitled land becomes scarce, as it has recently, especially in the markets in which we build, and the cost of purchasing such land is relatively high. Changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws, such as those related to building regulations, taxation and planning, as well as political conditions, financial market conditions, local and national economic conditions, customers\u2019 financial condition, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations, among other factors, subject our land\u2019s market value to uncertainty. As a result, we may have to sell homes or land for lower than anticipated profit margins, record inventory impairment charges, or sell land at a loss. We may be required to take significant write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs if we elect not to move forward or exercise our options to purchase land. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market or result in impairment charges. Material impairment charges, abandonment charges or other write-downs of assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Related to Our Business\nAn adverse outcome in litigation to which we are or become a party could materially and adversely affect us.\nPresently and in the future, we are and may become subject to litigation, including claims relating to our operations, breach of contract, securities offerings or otherwise in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that now exist or may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Litigation or the resolution of litigation may affect the availability or cost of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us.\nNew and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build or delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, which can limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees, assessments and exactions for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result, home sales could decline and costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to a significant number and variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety, labor standards and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given property vary according to multiple factors, including the property\u2019s location, its environmental conditions and geographic attributes or historical artifacts, the present and former uses of the property, the presence or absence of endangered plants, animals or sensitive habitats, as well as conditions at nearby properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. For example, under certain environmental laws and regulations, third parties, such as environmental groups or neighborhood associations, may challenge the permits and other approvals required for our projects and operations. Any such claims may adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for such claims may be limited or non-existent.\nIn addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved and agency rulemaking and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rulemaking and litigation can be unpredictable, and at any time can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on or even the prohibition of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers\u2019 and homebuilders\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws, including those applicable to control of storm water discharges during construction, or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays. We expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber, and on other building materials.\nCalifornia and New York are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. For example, California imposes notification obligations respecting environmental conditions, sometimes recorded on deeds, and also those required to be delivered to persons accessing property or to home buyers or renters, which may cause some persons, or their financing sources, to view the subject parcels as less valuable or as impaired.\nUnder various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination.\nNew trade policies could make sourcing raw materials from foreign countries more difficult and more costly.\nThe federal government has recently imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of homes, including steel, aluminum, lumber, solar panels and washing machines, and has threatened to impose further tariffs, duties or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties or trade restrictions could cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains, increase our construction costs or home-building costs generally or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, result in liabilities, limit the areas in which we can build homes and delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to the site\u2019s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, including significant fines and penalties for any violation, and may prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nUnder various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, in those cases where an endangered species is involved, environmental rules and regulations may result in the elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas.\nEnvironmental regulations may have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials, such as lumber, and generally increase the cost to construct our homes.\nThere is a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local level relating to energy, emissions and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards, including California\u2019s solar mandate, which went into effect January 1, 2020, could significantly increase our cost to construct homes and we may be unable to fully recover such costs due to market conditions, which could cause a reduction in our homebuilding gross margin and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. Similarly, energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related regulations.\nOwnership, leasing and occupation of developed lots and the use of hazardous materials carries potential environmental risks and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, rules and regulations concerning easements, land use and the protection of health and the environment, including those governing discharge of pollutants, including asbestos, to soil, water and air, the handling of hazardous materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites.\nWe may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of man-made or natural hazardous or toxic substances located on, under or in a property currently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by us, whether or not we caused or knew of the pollution.\nThe particular impact and requirements of environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the site, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. We expect that increasingly stringent requirements may be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. Environmental laws may result in delays, cause us to implement time consuming and expensive compliance programs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas, such as wetlands. Concerns could arise due to post-acquisition changes in laws or agency policies, or the interpretation thereof.\nFurthermore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other sanctions and damages from third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of our failure to comply with, or liabilities under, applicable environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we are subject to third-party challenges, such as by environmental groups or neighborhood associations, under environmental laws and regulations to the permits and other approvals required for our projects and operations. These matters could adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a homebuilding and land development business with a wide variety of historic ownership, development, homebuilding and construction activities, we could be liable for future claims for damages as a result of the past or present use of hazardous materials, including building materials or fixtures known or suspected to be hazardous or to contain hazardous materials or due to use of building materials or fixtures which are associated with mold. Any such claims may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for such claims may be limited or nonexistent.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding and land development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks to those working at such sites. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of our projects, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies, governmental authorities and local communities, and our ability to win new business, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nLandsea Green can determine the outcome of major corporate transactions that require the approval of our stockholders and may take actions that conflict with the interests of other of our stockholders.\nLandsea Green currently holds, indirectly, a majority of the voting rights in us. As long as Landsea Green holds such majority of voting rights, Landsea Green will have the ability to exercise control in our business, and may cause us to take actions that are not in, or conflict with, the interests of other stockholders such as incurring additional indebtedness, selling assets or other actions that negatively affect our net assets. Similarly, Landsea Green will be able to control our major policy decisions by controlling the selection of senior management, determining the timing and amount of approving annual budgets, deciding on increases or decreases in stock capital, determining issuances of new securities, approving disposals of assets or business, and amending our articles of association. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders.\nOur stockholder structure may negatively affect our ability to obtain equity financing required for opportunistic investments or to offset periods of net losses or financial distress. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional equity financing in a timely fashion or at all. If we were unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or may be unable to avoid defaults under our obligations.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, may qualify for, and may choose to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nThe Seller beneficially owns a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock, making us a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Pursuant to Nasdaq listing standards, a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq listing standards that would otherwise require it to have: (i) a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors; (ii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; (iii) a compensation committee charter which, among other things, provides the compensation committee with the authority and funding to retain compensation consultants and other advisors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors. We intend to rely on the exemptions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.\nAccordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition, on June 20, 2012, the SEC passed final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 pertaining to compensation committee independence and the role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other advisers to the compensation committee. The SEC\u2019s rules direct each of the national securities exchanges (including Nasdaq) to develop listing standards requiring, among other things, that: (i) compensation committees be composed of fully independent directors, as determined pursuant to new independence requirements; (ii) compensation committees be explicitly charged with hiring and overseeing compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisors; and (iii) compensation committees be required to consider, when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors, certain independence factors, including factors that examine the relationship between the consultant or advisor\u2019s employer and us. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are not subject to these compensation committee independence requirements.\nOur only significant asset is our ownership interest in Landsea and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership of Landsea. We depend on Landsea for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company and to pay any dividends with respect to our Common Stock. The financial condition and operating requirements of Landsea may limit our ability to obtain cash from Landsea. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Landsea may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d) may modify, delay or prevent our future acquisition or investment activities.\nFor so long as Landsea Green retains a material ownership interest in us, we will be deemed a \u201cforeign person\u201d under the regulations relating to CFIUS. As such, acquisitions of or investments in U.S. businesses or foreign businesses with U.S. subsidiaries that we may wish to pursue may be subject to CFIUS review, the scope of which was recently expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (\u201cFIRRMA\u201d), to include certain non-passive, non-controlling investments (including certain investments in entities that hold or process personal information about U.S. nationals), certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business, transactions the structure of which is designed or intended to evade or circumvent CFIUS jurisdiction and any transaction resulting in a \u201cchange in the rights\u201d of a foreign person in a U.S. business if that change could result in either control of the business or a covered non-controlling investment. FIRRMA also subjects certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If a particular proposed acquisition or investment in a U.S. business falls within CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction, we may determine that we are required to make a mandatory filing or that we will submit to CFIUS review on a voluntary basis, or to proceed with the transaction without submitting to CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the transaction. CFIUS may decide to block or delay an acquisition or investment by us, impose conditions with respect to such acquisition or investment or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business that we acquired without first obtaining CFIUS approval, which may limit the attractiveness of or prevent us from pursuing certain acquisitions or investments that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In addition, among other things, FIRRMA authorizes CFIUS to prescribe regulations defining \u201cforeign person\u201d differently in different contexts, which could result in less favorable treatment for investments and acquisitions by companies from countries of \u201cspecial concern.\u201d If such future regulations impose additional burdens on acquisition and investment activities involving PRC and PRC-controlled entities, our ability to consummate transactions falling within CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders may be hindered.\nWe are the managing member in certain joint venture limited liability companies, and therefore may be liable for joint venture obligations.\nCertain of our active joint ventures are organized as limited liability companies. We are the managing member in some of these. As a managing member or general partner, we may be liable for a joint venture\u2019s liabilities and obligations should the joint venture fail or be unable to pay these liabilities or obligations. These risks include, among others, that a partner in the joint venture may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions, that a partner may make poor business decisions or delay necessary actions, or that a partner may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is cyclical and adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for homes and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and highly sensitive to changes in general and local economic, real estate or other business conditions that are outside of our control and could reduce the demand for homes, including changes in:\n\u25cf overall consumer confidence and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u25cf U.S. and global financial system, macroeconomic conditions, market volatility and credit market stability, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and government actions and restrictive measures implemented in response;\n\u25cf employment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u25cf availability and pricing of financing for homebuyers;\n\u25cf short and long-term interest rates;\n\u25cf demographic trends;\n\u25cf changes in energy prices;\n\u25cf housing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes, among other factors;\n\u25cf private party and governmental residential consumer mortgage loan programs, and federal and state regulation of lending and appraisal practices;\n\u25cf federal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, government actions, policies, programs and regulations directed at or affecting the housing market, tax benefits associated with purchasing and owning a home, and the standards, fees and size limits applicable to the purchase or insuring of mortgage loans by government-sponsored enterprises and government agencies;\n\u25cf the supply of and prices for available new or existing homes, including lender-owned homes acquired through foreclosures and short sales and homes held for sale by investors and speculators, and other housing alternatives, such as apartments and other residential rental property;\n\u25cf homebuyer interest in our current or new product designs and community locations, and general consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to choosing other housing alternatives; and\n\u25cf real estate taxes.\nAdverse changes in these or other general and local economic or business conditions may affect our business nationally or in particular regions or localities. During the most recent economic downturn, several of the markets we serve, and the U.S. housing market as a whole, experienced a prolonged decrease in demand for new homes, as well as an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale. Demand for new homes is affected by weakness in the resale market because many new homebuyers need to sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us. In addition, demand may be adversely affected by alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties and existing homes. In the event of another economic downturn or if general economic conditions should worsen, our home sales could decline and we could be required to write down or dispose of assets or restructure our operations or debt, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAdverse changes in economic or business conditions can also cause increased home order cancellation rates, diminished demand and prices for our homes, and diminished value of our real estate investments. These changes can also cause us to take longer to build homes and make it more costly to do so. We may not be able to recover any of the increased costs by raising prices because of weak market conditions and increasing pricing pressure. Additionally, the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many homebuyers sign their home purchase contracts before or early in the construction process. The potential difficulties described above could impact homebuyers\u2019 ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, if our competitors are more successful or offer better value to customers, it may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment that is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders and land developers in each geographical market in which we operate. There are relatively low barriers to entry into the homebuilding business. We compete with numerous large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders and land developers for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to the businesses of our competitors and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased competition could hurt our business by preventing us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or making acquisitions more expensive, hindering our market share expansion and causing us to increase selling incentives and reduce prices. Additionally, an oversupply of homes available for sale or a discounting of home prices could materially and adversely affect pricing for homes in the markets in which we operate.\nOver the past several years, we have embarked on a strategy to expand our product offerings to include more affordably-priced homes to reach a deeper pool of qualified buyers and grow our overall community count. We anticipate that we will continue to build more affordably-priced homes. We believe there is more competition among homebuilding companies in more affordable product offerings than in the luxury and move-up segments. We also compete with the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned,\u201d home market, the size of which may change significantly as a result of changes in the rate of home foreclosures, which is affected by changes in economic conditions both nationally and locally.\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain large national and regional homebuilding competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturn in the housing market. We compete directly with a number of large national and regional homebuilders that may have longer operating histories and greater financial and operational resources than we do, including a lower cost of capital. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors, local governments and suppliers in the markets in which we operates or in which we may operate in the future. This may give our competitors an advantage in securing materials and labor at lower prices, marketing their products and allowing their homes to be delivered to customers more quickly and at more favorable prices. This competition could reduce our market share and limit our ability to expand our business.\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should experience a decline.\nOur current business involves the design, construction and sale of innovative detached and attached homes in planned communities in major metropolitan areas in California, Arizona and Metro New York. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn affecting one or more of these areas, or affecting any sector of employment on which the residents of such area are dependent, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations. For example, much of the employment base in the San Francisco bay area is dependent upon the technology sector. During the downturn from 2007 to 2011, land values, the demand for new homes and home prices declined substantially in California. Additionally, in the past the state of California has experienced severe budget shortfalls and taken measures such as raising taxes and increasing fees to offset the deficit. Accordingly, our sales, results of operations, financial condition and business would be negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, the job sector or the homebuilding industry in the Western U.S. regions in which our operations are concentrated.\nIn addition, our ability to acquire land parcels for new homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning and other market conditions. The availability of land parcels in our California and Arizona markets at reasonable prices is limited. If the supply of land parcels appropriate for development of homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow could be significantly limited, and the number of homes that we build and sell could decline.\nTightening of mortgage lending standards and mortgage financing requirements and rising interest rates could adversely affect the availability of mortgage loans for potential purchasers of our homes, and increases in property and other local taxes could prevent customers from purchasing homes, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nGenerally, housing demand is negatively impacted by the unavailability of mortgage financing, as a result of tightening of mortgage lending standards and mortgage financing requirements, in addition to factors that increase the cost of financing a home such as increases in interest rates, down payment requirements, insurance premiums or limitations on mortgage interest deductibility. A substantial percentage of our buyers finance their home purchases with mortgage financing. Additionally, deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other nonconforming loans has caused most lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that do not conform to Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), Federal Housing Administration (the \u201cFHA\u201d), or Veterans Administration (the \u201cVA\u201d) standards. In addition, as a result of the turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry during the last significant economic downturn, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. This legislation provided for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices that reduce the availability of loans to borrowers or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain such loans. Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications, in turn, make it more difficult for a borrower to finance the purchase of a new home or the purchase of an existing home from a potential \u201cmove-up\u201d buyer who wishes to purchase one of our homes. The foregoing may also hinder our ability to realize our backlog because our home purchase contracts provide customers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow customers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event that they cannot arrange for adequate financing. As a result, rising interest rates, stricter underwriting standards, and a reduction of loan products, among other similar factors, can contribute to a decrease in our home sales. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe federal government has also taken on a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backedsecurities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the FHA and the VA. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or cessation of the federal government\u2019s mortgage-related programs or policies. Additionally, the FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs, or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Due to federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue supporting the mortgage-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels, or it may revise significantly the federal government\u2019s participation in and support of the residential mortgage market. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, especially as they move down in price point, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce our home sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent federal income tax laws cap individual state and local tax deductions at $10,000 for the aggregate of state and local real property and income taxes or state and local sales taxes, and cap mortgage interest deduction to $750,000 of debt ($1,000,000 after 2025) for mortgages taken out after December 15, 2017. Additionally, limits on deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes may increase the after-tax cost of owning a home for some individuals. Any increases in personal income tax rates or additional tax deduction limits could adversely impact demand for new homes, including homes we build, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, or provide low- and moderate-income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increases in local real estate taxes as well as the limitation on deductibility of such costs could adversely affect our potential home buyers, who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide, as a result, not to purchase one of our homes or not purchase a resale, which would negatively impact homebuyers that need to sell their home before they purchase one of ours.\nAny limitation on, or reduction or elimination of, tax benefits associated with homeownership would have an adverse effect upon the demand for homes, which could be material to our business.\nCurrent federal income tax laws include limits on federal tax deductions individual taxpayers may take on mortgage loan interest payments and on state and local taxes, including real estate taxes, that are lower than historical limits. These changes could reduce the perceived affordability of homeownership, and therefore the demand for homes, or have a moderating impact on home sales prices in areas with relatively high housing prices or high state and local income taxes and real estate taxes, including in certain of our served markets in California and New York. In addition, if the federal government further changes, or a state government changes, its income tax laws by eliminating or substantially reducing the income tax benefits associated with homeownership, the after-tax cost of owning a home could measurably increase. Any increases in personal income tax rates or tax deduction limits or restrictions enacted at the federal or state levels could adversely impact demand for or selling prices of new homes, including our homes, and the effect on our consolidated financial statements could be adverse and material.\nWe currently have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with a third party in which we have less than a controlling interest. These investments are highly illiquid and have significant risks due to, in part, a lack of sole decision-making authority and reliance on the financial condition and liquidity of our joint venture partners.\nWe own interests in various joint ventures and, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Landsea Homes\u2019 investments in and advances to its unconsolidated joint ventures were $21 million and $43 million, respectively. We have entered into joint ventures in order to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. Such joint venture investments involve risks not otherwise present in wholly owned projects, including the following:\n\u25cf Control and Partner Dispute Risk. We do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, management and other aspects of any such project or joint venture, which may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest but opposed by our partners. We cannot exercise sole decision-making authority regarding any such project or joint venture, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as acquisitions or sales. Disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business and could result in subjecting the projects owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Our existing joint venture agreements contain buy-sell provisions pursuant to which one partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between buying the other partner\u2019s interest or selling our interest to that partner; we may not have the capital to purchase our joint venture parties\u2019 interest under these circumstances even if we believe it would be beneficial to do so.\n\u25cf Development Risk. Typically, we serve as the administrative member, managing member, or general partner of our joint ventures and one of our subsidiaries acts as the general contractor while our joint venture partner serves as the capital provider. Due to our respective role in these joint ventures, we may become liable for obligations beyond our proportionate equity share. In addition, the projects we build through joint ventures are often larger and have a longer time horizon than the typical project developed by our wholly owned homebuilding operations. Time delays associated with obtaining entitlements, unforeseen development issues, unanticipated labor and material cost increases, higher carrying costs, and general market deterioration and other changes are more likely to impact larger, long-term projects, all of which may negatively impact the profitability and capital needs of these ventures and our proportionate share of income and capital.\n\u25cf Financing Risk. There are generally a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition, development and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures. During difficult market conditions, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms, or to refinance existing joint venture borrowings as such borrowings mature. In addition, a partner may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions or may become bankrupt, which may cause us and any other remaining partners to need to fulfill the obligations of the venture in order to preserve their interests and retain any benefits from the joint venture. As a result, we could be contractually required, or elect, to contribute our corporate funds to the joint venture to finance acquisition and development or construction costs following termination or step-down of joint venture financing that the joint venture is unable to restructure, extend, or refinance with another third party lender. In addition, our ability to contribute our funds to or for the joint venture may be limited if we do not meet the credit facility conditions discussed above. In addition, we sometimes finance projects in our unconsolidated joint ventures with debt that is secured by the underlying real property. Secured indebtedness increases the risk of the joint venture\u2019s loss of ownership of the property (which would, in turn, impair the value of our ownership interests in the joint venture).\n\u25cf Contribution Risk. Under credit enhancements that we typically provide with respect to joint venture borrowings, we and our partners could be required to make additional unanticipated investments in and advances to these joint ventures, either in the form of capital contributions or loan repayments, to reduce such outstanding borrowings. We may have to make additional contributions that exceed our proportional share of capital if our partners fail to contribute any or all of their share. While in most instances we would be able to exercise remedies available under the applicable joint venture agreements if a partner fails to contribute its proportional share of capital, a partner\u2019s financial condition may preclude any meaningful cash recovery on the obligation.\n\u25cf Completion Risk. We often sign a completion agreement in connection with obtaining financing for our joint ventures. Under such agreements, we may be compelled to complete a project, usually with costs within the budget related to the project being funded by the lender with any budget shortfalls being borne by us even if we no longer have an economic interest in the joint venture or the joint venture no longer has an interest in the property.\n\u25cf Illiquid Investment Risk. We lack a controlling interest in certain of our joint ventures and therefore are generally unable to compel such joint ventures to sell assets, return invested capital, require additional capital contributions or take any other action without the vote of at least one or more of our venture partners. This means that, absent partner agreement, we may not be able to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash.\n\u25cf Consolidation Risk. The accounting rules for joint ventures are complex and the decision as to whether it is proper to consolidate a joint venture onto our balance sheet is fact intensive. If the facts concerning an unconsolidated joint venture were to change and a triggering event under applicable accounting rules were to occur, we might be required to consolidate previously unconsolidated joint ventures onto our balance sheet which could adversely impact our financial statements and our leverage and other financial conditions or covenants.\nAny of the above might subject a project to liabilities in excess of those contemplated and adversely affect the value of our current and future joint venture investments.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season. We typically achieve our highest new home sales orders in the spring and summer, although new homes sales order activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities and the timing of new community openings. Because it typically takes us four to eight months to construct a new home, we deliver a greater number of homes in the second half of the calendar year as sales orders convert to home deliveries. As a result, our revenues from homebuilding operations are typically higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, and we generally experience higher capital demands in the first half of the year when we incur construction costs. If, due to construction delays or other causes, we cannot close our expected number of homes in the second half of the year, our financial condition and full year results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Debt and Liquidity\nBecause homes are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time.\nHomes are relatively difficult to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period of time. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nWe may not be able to access sufficient capital on favorable terms, or at all, which could result in an inability to acquire lots, increase home construction costs or delay home construction entirely.\nThe homebuilding industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development. There is no assurance that cash generated from our operations, borrowings incurred under credit agreements or project-level financing arrangements, or proceeds raised in capital markets transactions will be sufficient to finance our capital projects or otherwise fund our liquidity needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to finance our capital projects or otherwise fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:\n\u25cf reduce or delay business activities, land acquisitions and capital expenditures;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf obtain additional debt or equity capital; or\n\u25cf restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.\nThese alternative measures may not be successful and we may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt will limit our ability to pursue these alternatives. Further, we may seek additional capital in the form of project-level financing from time to time. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. Land acquisition, development and construction activities may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of financing or the unwillingness of third parties to engage in joint ventures. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could cause project delays and any such delay could result in cost increases and may adversely affect our sales and future results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness and may incur additional debt in the future.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness and our ability to incur additional indebtedness under our various credit facilities is subject to and potentially restricted by customary requirements and borrowing base formulas. As of December 31, 2020, Landsea Homes had approximately $272 million outstanding under its various credit facilities and loan agreements, with approximately $278 million of additional borrowing capacity, subject to customary borrowing base requirements. Our indebtedness could have detrimental consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional financing as needed for working capital, land acquisition costs, building costs, other capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, or to refinance existing indebtedness before its scheduled maturity, may be limited;\n\u25cf we will need to use a portion of cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available for other purposes;\n\u25cf if we are unable to comply with the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness, the holders of that indebtedness could accelerate that indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us;\n\u25cf the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the debt being refinanced, if at all.\nWe cannot be certain that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt, support operations and meet other obligations. If we do not have the resources to meet our obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our outstanding debt, sell assets or borrow more money. We may not be able to do so on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses. Defaults under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nA breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default.\nA default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our credit facility would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the applicable facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under any secured indebtedness, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or the holders of our notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u25cf limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u25cf unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business\ndownturns; or\n\u25cf unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow or continue our existing operations.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose operating and financial restrictions. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain equity interests;\n\u25cf pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity or prepay subordinated debt;\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf incur liens;\n\u25cf create certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to transfer assets;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf create unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these restrictions, our ability to obtain additional financing as needed for working capital, land acquisition costs, building costs, other capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, or to refinance existing indebtedness before its scheduled maturity, may be limited. In addition, our credit facility currently contains certain financial covenants with which we must test compliance periodically. Failure to have sufficient borrowing base availability in the future or to be in compliance with our financial covenants under our credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may in the future enter into other agreements refinancing or otherwise governing indebtedness which impose yet additional restrictions and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to stockholders and otherwise affect our operating policies. These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.\nPotential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur corporate credit ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital, especially debt, and negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt. Our credit ratings could be downgraded or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including a significant increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.\nInterest rate changes may adversely affect us.\nWe currently do not hedge against interest rate fluctuations. We may obtain in the future one or more forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements, interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder. In addition, we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties. Adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable. We could be required to liquidate one or more of our assets at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our assets in order to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable performance, payment and completion surety bonds and letters of credit, which could limit our future growth or impair our results of operations.\nWe provide bonds in the ordinary course of business to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects or in support of obligations to build community improvements such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, and to support similar development activities by certain of our joint ventures. As a result of the deterioration in market conditions during the recent downturn, surety providers became increasingly reluctant to issue new bonds and some providers were requesting credit enhancements (such as cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds, which trends may continue. We may also be required to provide performance bonds or letters of credit to secure our performance under various escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds or letters of credit when required or the cost or operational restrictions or conditions imposed by issuers to obtain them increases significantly, we may not be able to develop or may be significantly delayed in developing a community or communities or may incur significant additional expenses, and, as a result, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition or results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our communities.\nWe provide performance bonds and letters of credit in the ordinary course of business to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects or in support of obligations to build community improvements such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities. We may also be required to provide performance bonds or letters of credit to secure our performance under various escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds or letters of credit when required or the cost or operational restrictions or conditions imposed by issuers to obtain them increases significantly, we may be significantly delayed in developing our communities or may incur significant additional expenses and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Securities\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. Resales of the shares of Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nThere may be a large number of our shares of Common Stock sold in the market The shares held by our public stockholders are freely tradeable.\nThe LF Capital Restricted Stockholders, including the Sponsor, hold more than 5% of the Common Stock with respect to their converted Founder Shares. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, dated June 19, 2018, by and between the Company and the LF Capital Restricted Stockholders, the LF Capital Restricted Stockholders are entitled to registration of the converted Founder Shares. In addition, holders of our Private Placement Warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. These holders also have certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination.\nCommon Stock issued to the Seller pursuant to the Business Combination will be freely tradeable following the expiration of the lock-up on the earlier of (A) one year following the closing of the Business Combination and (B) subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, (x) if the last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share as quoted on Nasdaq (adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days following the closing of the Business Combination or (y) the date following the closing of the Business Combination on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company\u2019s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of the Company for cash, securities or other property, as set forth in the Seller Lock-up Agreement.\nCommon Stock held by the Sponsor and certain other holders of converted Founder Shares as a result of the conversion of its Class B common stock will be freely tradeable following the expiration of a lock-up for the same duration as the Seller Lock-up Agreement, as set forth in the Sponsor Lock-up Agreement (with 500,000 of such shares being subject to the terms of forfeiture pursuant to that certain Founder\u2019s Surrender Agreement). Our Common Stock held by the LF Capital Restricted Stockholders (other than the Sponsor and certain other holders of converted Founder Shares) as a result of the conversion of their Class B common stock is freely tradeable as a result of the registration of the resale thereof pursuant to the related registration statement.\nSuch sales of shares of our Common Stock or the perception of such sales may depress the market price of our Common Stock or public warrants.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Business Combination and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities may vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC Pink, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. Nasdaq listing requirements require us to have 400 round lot holders with respect to the warrants. In the event we do not have an adequate number of round lot holders to maintain the listing of the warrants, the warrants will be delisted from Nasdaq. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nIf the Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nFluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Immediately prior to the Business Combination, there was no public market for Landsea Homes\u2019 stock and trading in the shares of our securities was not active. If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf success of competitors;\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the market in general;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the volume of securities available for public sale;\n\u25cf any major change in our Board or management;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of securities by our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u25cf the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf failure to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq;\n\u25cf failure to comply with SOX or other laws or regulations;\n\u25cf actual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u25cf labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u25cf profitability of our products, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates;\n\u25cf impairment of long-lived assets;\n\u25cf macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u25cf negative publicity relating to products we serve;\n\u25cf changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf expansion to new markets; and\n\u25cf fluctuations in commodity prices.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of SOX, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of SOX are significantly more stringent than those required of Landsea Homes as a privately-held company. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTesting and maintaining these controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in the internal control over our financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express a favorable opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of SOX, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following June 22, 2023, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock and public warrants that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile. Landsea Homes had total revenues during calendar year 2020 of approximately $734.6 million. If we continue to expand our business through acquisitions or continue to grow revenues organically, we may cease to be an emerging growth company prior to June 22, 2023.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAs a result of our reliance on these exemptions or reduced disclosures, investors may not have access to certain information they deem important or may find our securities less attractive. This may result in a less active trading market for our securities and the price of our securities, including our Common Stock or public warrants may be more volatile.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d because we had public float of less than $250 million on the applicable measurement date. As a smaller reporting company, we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe exercise of our warrants will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 15,525,000 shares of Common Stock as part of our IPO and, on the IPO closing date, we issued Private Placement Warrants (i) to the Sponsor to purchase 7,760,000 shares of Common Stock (of which 2,260,000 Private Placement Warrants were forfeited in connection with the Business Combination and 2,200,000 were transferred to the Seller in connection with the Business Combination) and (ii) to BlackRock Credit Alpha Master Fund L.P., to purchase 550,440 shares of Common Stock, in each case at $11.50 per share. The public warrants are exercisable for one-tenth of one share at an exercise price of $1.15 per one-tenth share ($11.50 per whole share) pursuant to the Warrant Amendment. The shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of our warrants will result in dilution to the then existing holders of Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock or public warrants.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the public warrants except that, so long as they are held by the Seller, Sponsor or permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) are subject to registration rights.\nThe warrants may not ever be in the money, they may expire worthless and the terms of the warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to holders of our warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of the warrants could be increased, the warrants could be converted into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of our Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without a warrant holder\u2019s approval.\nThe public warrants may not ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless. Our warrants were issued in registered form under the warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company and us (the \u201cWarrant Agreement\u201d). The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nWe may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to a warrant holder, thereby making the warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force warrant holders to: (1) exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so (2) sell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the Seller, Sponsor or permitted transferees.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Common Stock and public warrants are listed on Nasdaq. There is no guarantee that these securities will remain listed on Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that these securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. In general, we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities.\nIf Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that the Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because the Common Stock and public warrants are listed on Nasdaq, they will be covered securities. However, if we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, then the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the price and trading volume of our securities would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts that may cover us change their recommendation regarding our securities adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our securities would likely decline. If any analyst that may cover us ceases covering us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our securities to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent once the company is no longer controlled, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf a vote of 25% required for stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u25cf a \u201csynthetic\u201d anti-takeover provision in lieu of the statutory protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law;\n\u25cf a vote of 80% required to approve a merger as long as the majority stockholder owns at least 20% of our stock;\n\u25cf a vote of 70% required to approve certain amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws;\n\u25cf a provision allowing the directors to fill any vacancies on the Board, including vacancies that result from an increase in the number of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances; and\n\u25cf the designation of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we select or consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware) for any complaint asserting claims, including any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder in such capacity, any action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, or any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine as interpreted by Delaware state courts. In addition, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall be the federal district courts of the United States, but the forum selection provision will not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provision in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, under the Securities Act, federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments, applicable legal requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, stockholders may need to sell their shares of our common stock to realize a return on investment and may not be able to sell shares at or above the price paid for them.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results as a public company.\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Our financial condition and future results of operations could be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, so it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results as a public company to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.\nIn particular, our historical consolidated financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows primarily because of the following factors:\n\u25cf Prior to the Business Combination, the Seller or one of its affiliates provided support for various corporate functions for Landsea Homes, such as information technology, shared services, medical insurance, procurement, logistics, marketing, human resources, legal, finance and internal audit;\n\u25cf Our historical consolidated financial results reflect the direct, indirect and allocated costs for such services historically provided by the Seller prior to the Business Combination, and these costs may significantly differ from the comparable expenses we would have incurred as an independent company;\n\u25cf Prior to the Business Combination, Landsea Homes\u2019 working capital requirements and capital expenditures historically were satisfied as part of the Seller\u2019s corporate-wide cash management and centralized funding programs, and our cost of debt and other capital may significantly differ from that which is reflected in our historical combined financial statements for the periods prior to the Business Combination; and\n\u25cf The historical combined financial information for the periods prior to the Business Combination may not fully reflect the costs associated with the Business Combination, including the costs related to being an independent public company.\nSimilarly, unaudited pro forma financial information previously provided was provided for illustrative purposes only and was prepared based on a number of assumptions including, but not limited to, LF Capital being treated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company for financial reporting purposes in the Business Combination and the total debt obligations and the cash and cash equivalents of Landsea Homes on an assumed date for the Business Combination closing.\nOur ability to be successful will depend upon the efforts of our key personnel, including the key personnel of Landsea and the Seller whom we expect to stay with us. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business and our financial condition could suffer as a result.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of certain key management personnel. It is possible that we will lose some key management personnel in the future, some of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of key management personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business. Our ability to retain key management personnel or to attract suitable replacements should any member(s) of our management team leave is dependent on the culture our leadership team fosters and on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key management personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained key management life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of any of our key management personnel.\nExperienced employees in the homebuilding, developed lot acquisition and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain and manage opportunities. In particular, relevant licenses and qualifications, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive lot acquisition opportunities. Experienced employees working in the homebuilding and construction industries are highly sought after. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative publicity could adversely affect our reputation as well as our business and financial results.\nUnfavorable media coverage related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of such media\u2019s accuracy or inaccuracy. The speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites, blogs or newsletters. Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlet could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which could adversely affect our business.\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security of our systems could adversely affect us.\nWe rely on information technology and other computer resources to perform important operational and marketing activities as well as to maintain our business and employee records and financial data. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer attacks by hackers, viruses, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and breach of data security protocols by our personnel or third-party service providers. Computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the controls that we have installed might be breached. Further, many of these computer resources are provided to us or are maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards, but which are ultimately outside of our control. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in information technology systems that involve interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, security breaches of information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, personal and confidential information, including information related to employees, counter-parties, and customers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage and liability under data privacy laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nWe have experienced cyber security incidents in the past. There can be no assurance that future cyber security incidents will not have a material impact on our business or operations.\nInflation and interest rate changes could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation could adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, raw materials and labor needed to operate our business, which in turn requires us to increase home selling prices in an effort to maintain satisfactory housing gross margins. Inflation typically also accompanies higher interest rates, which could adversely impact potential customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby further decreasing demand. If we are unable to raise the prices of our homes to offset the increasing costs of our operations, our margins could decrease. Furthermore, if we need to lower the prices of our homes to meet demand, the value of our land inventory may decrease. Depressed land values may cause us to abandon and forfeit deposits on land option contracts and other similar contracts if we cannot satisfactorily renegotiate the purchase price of the subject land. We may record charges against our earnings for inventory impairments if the value of our owned inventory, including land we decide to sell, is reduced, or for land option contract abandonments if we choose not to exercise land option contracts or other similar contracts, and these charges may be substantial. Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u25cf tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u25cf costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u25cf lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations or rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting rules, assumptions or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.\nAccounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our financial reporting are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgment. These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions or judgments, such as asset impairments and contingencies are likely to significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating financial statements from prior period(s). Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business.\nActs of war or terrorism or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities throughout the world may have a substantial impact on the economy, consumer confidence, the housing market, our employees and our customers. Historically, perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars and related geopolitical risks have also created significant economic and political uncertainties. If any such events were to occur, or there was a perception that they were about to occur, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17890, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "LFAC"}
