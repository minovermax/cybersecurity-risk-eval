{"cik": "1157647", "company": "Western New England Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those set forth below, any of which could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent results, or from the other forward looking statements that the Company may make from time to time in news releases, annual reports and other written or oral communications. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect the Company are described below. These risks and uncertainties are not listed in any particular order of priority and are not necessarily the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and stockholders could lose some or all of their investment.\nThe Possibility of the Economy\u2019s Return to Recessionary Conditions and the Possibility of Further Turmoil or Volatility in the Financial Markets Would Likely Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Position and Results of Operations. The Company continues to face risks resulting from the aftermath of the severe recession generally and the moderate pace of the current recovery. A slowing or failure of the economic recovery would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on the Company and on others in the financial services industry. In particular, the Company may face the following risks in connection with the economic or market environment:\n\u25cf\nThe Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u25cf\nThe Company faces increased regulation of the banking and financial services industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u25cf\nMarket developments may affect customer confidence levels and may cause increases in loan delinquencies and default rates, which management expects would adversely impact the Bank\u2019s charge-offs and provision for loan losses.\n\u25cf\nMarket developments may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s securities portfolio by causing other-than-temporary-impairments, prompting write-downs and securities losses.\n\u25cf\nCompetition in banking and financial services industry could intensify as a result of the consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.\nOur Loan Portfolio Includes Loans with a Higher Risk of Loss. The Company originates commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans primarily within its market area. The lending strategy focuses on residential real estate lending as well as servicing commercial customers, including increased emphasis on commercial and industrial lending and commercial deposit relationships. Commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers.\nThese loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u25cf\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u25cf\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\n\u25cf\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.\nAny downturn in the real estate market or local economy could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from the borrowers\u2019 businesses thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans.\nThe Company\u2019s Allowance for Loan Losses May Not be Adequate to Cover Loan Losses, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations. A significant source of risk for the Company arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most loans originated by the Bank are secured, but some loans are unsecured based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrowers. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans principally includes a wide variety of real estate, and to a lesser extent personal property, either of which may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans.\nCollateral values and the financial performance of borrowers may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates and debt service levels, changes in oil and gas prices, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, widespread disease, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events, which are beyond the control of the Company. In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that do not meet industry recognized standards might create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when in fact it is not. Although the Company may acquire any real estate or other assets that secure defaulted loans through foreclosures or other similar remedies, the amounts owed under the defaulted loans may exceed the value of the assets acquired.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings, that represents management\u2019s estimate of probable losses inherent within the existing portfolio of loans. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of the Company\u2019s management. While the Company strives to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become non-performing, it may not be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become non-performing assets, or be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified to be non-performing. The FASB has announced changes to accounting standards that will impact the way banking organizations estimate their allowance for loan losses beginning in January 2020. These changes or any others to accounting rules governing credit impairment estimates and recognition may increase the level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, depending upon the magnitude of the changes, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in the Company\u2019s Non-performing Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Future. Non-performing assets adversely affect net income in various ways. While the Company pays interest expense to fund non-performing assets, no interest income is recorded on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration and workout costs increase, resulting in additional reductions of earnings. When taking collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, the Company is required to carry the property or loan at its then-estimated fair market value less estimated cost to sell, which, when compared to the carrying value of the loan, may result in a loss. These non-performing loans and other real estate owned also increase the Company\u2019s risk profile and the capital that regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks, and have an impact on the Company\u2019s FDIC risk based deposit insurance premium rate. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management and staff. The Company may experience further increases in non-performing loans in the future, and non-performing assets may result in further costs and losses in the future, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Use of Appraisals in Deciding Whether to Make a Loan Does Not Ensure the Value of the Collateral. In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property or other business assets, the Company generally requires an internal evaluation or independent appraisal of the asset. However, these assessment methods are only an estimate of the value of the collateral at the time the assessment is made, and involve a large degree of estimates and assumptions and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of the valuation. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment and events occurring after the initial assessment may cause the value of the assets to decrease in future periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual values could differ significantly from these estimates. As a result of any of these factors, the value of collateral backing a loan may be less than estimated at the time of assessment, and if a default occurs the Company may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company is Subject to Environmental Risks Associated with Real Estate Held as Collateral or Occupied. When a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, the Company may purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. The Company may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. The Company also occupies owned and leased premises where branches and other bank facilities are located. While the Company\u2019s lending, foreclosure and facilities policies and guidelines are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Company may own, acquire, manage or occupy. Environmental laws could force the Company to clean up the properties at the Company\u2019s expense. The Company may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The cost associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses. It may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth and it may be difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. The Company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations if the Company takes a role in managing those operations after a default. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nConcentration in Commercial Real Estate Lending is Subject to Heightened Risk Management and Regulatory Review. If a concentration in commercial real estate lending is present, as measured under government banking regulations, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If a concentration is determined to exist, the Company may incur additional operating expenses in order to comply with additional risk management practices and increased capital requirements which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Investment Securities Portfolio is Subject to Credit Risk and Liquidity Risk and Declines in Value in its Investment Securities Portfolio May Require the Company to Record Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) Charges That Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition. There are inherent risks associated with the Company\u2019s investment activities, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These risks include the impact from changes in interest rates, weakness in real estate, municipalities, government sponsored enterprises, or other industries, the impact of changes in income tax rates on the value of tax exempt securities, adverse changes in regional or national economic conditions, and general turbulence in domestic and foreign financial markets, among other things. These conditions could adversely impact the fair market value and/or the ultimate collectability of the Company\u2019s investments. In addition to fair market value impairment, carrying values may be adversely impacted due to a fundamental deterioration of the individual municipality, government agency, or corporation whose debt obligations the Company owns or of the individual company or fund in which the Company has invested.\nIf an investment\u2019s value is deemed other than temporarily impaired, then the Company is required to write down the carrying value of the investment which may involve a charge to earnings. The determination of the level of OTTI involves a high degree of judgment and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current market risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Any OTTI charges, depending upon the magnitude of the charges, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Dividends Are Not Paid on Our Investment in the FHLB, or if Our Investment is Classified as Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired, Our Earnings and/or Shareholders\u2019 Equity Could Decrease. As a member of the FHLB, the Company is required to own a minimum required amount of FHLB capital stock, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. This stock is classified as a restricted investment and carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value of the FHLB stock. If negative events or deterioration in the FHLB financial condition or capital levels occurs, the Company\u2019s investment in FHLB capital stock may become other-than-temporarily impaired to some degree. There can be no assurance that FHLB stock dividends will be declared in the future. If either of these were to occur, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nInterest Rate Volatility Could Adversely Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition. The Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, meaning the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The re-pricing frequency and magnitude of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are not identical, and therefore subject the Company to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including monetary policy of the federal government, inflation and deflation, volatility of domestic and global financial markets, volatility of credit markets, and competition. If the interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other liabilities increase at a faster rate or magnitude than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly or steeply than falling interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.\nReplacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations. In July 2017, the United Kingdom regulator that regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) announced its intention to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. In April 2018, the New York Federal Reserve commenced publishing an alternative reference rate to LIBOR as calculated for the U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD-LIBOR\u201d), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), proposed by a group of major market participants (the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d)), convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve with participation by SEC Staff and other regulators. SOFR is based on transactions in the more robust U.S. Treasury repurchase market and has been proposed as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that currently rely on USD-LIBOR as a reference rate. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted.\nSuch developments and any other legal or regulatory changes in the method by which LIBOR is determined or the transition from LIBOR to a successor benchmark may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, and changes in the rules or methodologies of LIBOR, which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in LIBOR\u2019s determination and, in certain situations, could result in LIBOR no longer being determined and published.\nWe have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR, or any changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR, could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us, could create considerable costs and additional risk and could have an adverse impact on our overall financial condition or results of operations. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the Local Economy May Affect our Future Growth Possibilities. The Company\u2019s success depends principally on the general economic conditions of the primary market areas in which the Company operates. The local economic conditions in these regions have a significant impact on the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, as well as the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit funding sources. The Company\u2019s market area is principally located in Hampden and Hampshire Counties, Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in northern Connecticut. The local economy may affect future growth possibilities. The Company\u2019s future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of our regional economy and the ability to expand in our market area.\nNatural Disasters, Acts of Terrorism, Public Health Issues and Other External Events Could Harm Our Business. Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, such as the potential spread of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), could lead to regional quarantines, business shutdowns, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disruptions to power and communication services, impacting the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans or reducing the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe Company May Not be Able to Attract, Retain or Develop Key Personnel. The Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Company can be intense, and the Company may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that it depends upon for success. The unexpected loss of key personnel or the inability to identify and develop individuals for planned succession to key senior positions within management, or on the board of directors, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of the Company\u2019s market, years of industry or business experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements.\nCompetition in Our Primary Market Area May Reduce Our Ability to Attract and Retain Deposits and Originate Loans. We operate in a competitive market for both attracting deposits, which is our primary source of funds, and originating loans. Historically, our most direct competition for deposits has come from savings and commercial banks. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. We also face additional competition from internet-based institutions, brokerage firms and insurance companies. Competition for loan originations and deposits may limit our future growth and earnings prospects.\nDeposit Outflows May Increase Reliance on Borrowings and Brokered Deposits as Sources of Funds. The Company has traditionally funded asset growth principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are typically a lower cost source of funds than external wholesale funding (brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for wholesale funding. If, as a result of competitive pressures, market interest rates, alternative investment opportunities that present more attractive returns to customers, general economic conditions or other events, the balance of the Company\u2019s deposits decreases relative to the Company\u2019s overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale or other sources of external funding, or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future. Any such increased reliance on wholesale funding, or increases in funding rates in general could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income and, consequently, on its results of operations and financial condition.\nSources of External Funding Could Become Restricted and Impact the Company\u2019s Liquidity. The Company\u2019s external wholesale funding sources include borrowing capacity at the FHLB, capacity in the brokered deposit markets, other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks, as well as accessing the public markets through offerings of the Company\u2019s stock or issuance of debt. If, as a result of general economic conditions or other events, these sources of external funding become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher funding costs or operating restrictions in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company\u2019s operations and growth. Any such increase in funding costs or restrictions could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income and, consequently, on its results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Operate In a Highly-Regulated Environment That is Subject to Extensive Government Supervision and Regulation, Which May Interfere With Our Ability to Conduct Business and May Adversely Impact the Results of our Operations. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not the interests of stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. The Company is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation that govern nearly all aspects of our operations and can have a material impact on our business. Federal banking agencies have significant discretion regarding the supervision, regulation and enforcement of banking laws and regulations.\nFinancial laws, regulations and policies are subject to amendment by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Changes to statutes, regulations or policies, including changes in the interpretation of regulations or policies, could materially impact our business. These changes could also impose additional costs on us and limit the types of products and services that we may offer our customers. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and the failure to comply with any law, regulation or policy could result in sanctions by financial regulatory agencies, including civil monetary penalties, private lawsuits, or reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur. See the section titled, \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in ITEM 1. Business.\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis, financial institutions have been subject to increased scrutiny from Congress, state legislatures and federal and state financial regulatory agencies. Changes to the legal and regulatory framework have significantly altered the laws and regulations under which we operate. Compliance with these changes and any additional or amended laws, regulations and regulatory policies may reduce our ability to effectively compete in attracting and retaining customers. The passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, among other laws and regulations, has increased our costs of doing business and resulted in decreased revenues and net income. We cannot provide assurance that future changes in laws, regulations and policies will not adversely affect our business.\nState and Federal Regulatory Agencies Periodically Conduct Examinations of Our Business, Including for Compliance With Laws and Regulations, and Our Failure to Comply With Any Supervisory Actions to Which We Are or Become Subject as a Result of Such Examinations May Adversely Affect Our Business. Federal and state regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or violates any law or regulation, such agency may take certain remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to correct any deficiency. Remedial or enforcement actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced against a bank, to direct an increase in the bank\u2019s capital, to restrict the bank\u2019s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against a bank\u2019s officers or directors, and to remove officers and directors. In the event that the FDIC concludes that, among other things, our financial conditions cannot be corrected or that there is an imminent risk of loss to our depositors, it may terminate our deposit insurance. The OCC, as the supervisory and regulatory authority for federal savings associations, has similar enforcement powers with respect to our business. The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties, if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws.\nIf we were unable to comply with future regulatory directives, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, memoranda of understanding, and other regulatory enforcement actions. Such supervisory actions could, among other things, impose greater restrictions on our business, as well as our ability to develop any new business. We could also be required to raise additional capital, or dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed time period, or both. Failure to implement remedial measures as required by financial regulatory agencies could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could trigger one or more of the remedial actions described above. The terms of any supervisory action and associated consequences with any failure to comply with any supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility and overall financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Capital Levels Could Fall Below Regulatory Minimums. The Company and the Bank are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines of the FRB and the OCC, respectively. Failure to meet applicable minimum capital ratio requirements (including the capital conservation \u201cbuffer\u201d imposed by Basel III) may subject the Company and/or the Bank to various enforcement actions and restrictions. If the Company\u2019s capital levels decline, or if regulatory requirements increase, and the Company is unable to raise additional capital to offset that decline or meet the increased requirements, then its capital ratios may fall below regulatory capital adequacy levels. The Company\u2019s capital ratios could decline due to it experiencing rapid asset growth, or due to other factors, such as, by way of example only, possible future net operating losses, impairment charges against tangible or intangible assets, or adjustments to retained earnings due to changes in accounting rules.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to remain \u201cadequately-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, restrict the Company\u2019s ability to grow (both assets and branching activity), increase the Company\u2019s costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, prohibit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on common shares, and its ability to make acquisitions, and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial conditions, generally. If the Bank ceases to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, its ability to accept brokered deposits and the interest rates that it pays may be restricted.\nThe Carrying Value of the Company\u2019s Goodwill Could Become Impaired. In accordance with GAAP, the Company does not amortize goodwill and instead, at least annually, evaluates whether the carrying value of goodwill has become impaired. Impairment of goodwill may occur when the estimated fair value of the Company is less than its recorded book value (i.e., the net book value of its recorded assets and liabilities). This may occur, for example, when the estimated fair value of the Company declines due to changes in the assumptions and inputs used in management\u2019s estimate of fair value. A determination that goodwill has become impaired results in an immediate write-down of goodwill to its determined value with a resulting charge to operations. Any write down of goodwill will result in a decrease in net income and, depending upon the magnitude of the charge, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company, as Part of its Strategic Plans, Periodically Considers Potential Acquisitions. The Risks Presented by Acquisitions Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions including, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and avoid unanticipated costs relating to the merger, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business, the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. These risks may prevent us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or cause the realization of such benefits to take longer than expected.\nWe Face Cybersecurity Risks and Risks Associated With Security Breaches Which Have the Potential to Disrupt Our Operations, Cause Material Harm to Our Financial Condition, Result in Misappropriation of Assets, Compromise Confidential Information and/or Damage Our Business Relationships and Can Provide No Assurance That the Steps We and Our Service Providers Take in Response to These Risks Will Be Effective. We depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. We face cybersecurity risks and risks associated with security breaches or disruptions such as those through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, social engineering and phishing schemes or persons inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. These incidents may result in disruption of our operations, material harm to our financial condition, cash flows and the market price of our common stock, misappropriation of assets, compromise or corruption of confidential information collected in the course of conducting our business, liability for stolen information or assets, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, regulatory enforcement, litigation and damage to our stakeholder relationships. These risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks, upgrade and expand our technologies, systems and processes to adequately address them and provide periodic training for our employees to assist them in detecting phishing, malware and other schemes. Such attention diverts time and other resources from other activities and there is no assurance that our efforts will be effective.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our customers, employees and vendors. We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business. We can provide no assurance that the data security measures designed to protect confidential information on our systems established by us will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this personal information. There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the information we and our service providers collect and our and their computer systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.\nWe Continually Encounter Technological Change and The Failure to Understand and Adapt to These Changes Could Hurt Our Business. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services and technological advances are likely to intensify competition. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nControls and Procedures Could Fail, or Be Circumvented by Theft, Fraud or Robbery. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting, corporate governance policies, compensation policies, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and security controls to prevent and detect theft, fraud or robbery from both internal and external sources. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s internal controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, or a physical theft or robbery, whether by employees, management, directors, or external elements, or any illegal activity conducted by a Bank customer, could result in loss of assets, regulatory actions against the Company, financial loss, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, cause a loss of customer business, and expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company Relies on Third-Party Service Providers. The Company relies on independent firms to provide critical services necessary to conducting its business. These services include, but are not limited to: electronic funds delivery networks; check clearing houses; electronic banking services; investment advisory, management and custodial services; correspondent banking services; information security assessments and technology support services; and loan underwriting and review services. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of the independent firms\u2019 systems or in their delivery of services, or failure to perform in accordance with contracted service level agreements, for any number of reasons could also impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business and process transactions and result in loss of customer business and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nDamage to the Company\u2019s Reputation Could Affect the Company\u2019s Profitability and Shareholders\u2019 Value. The Company is dependent on its reputation within its market area, as a trusted and responsible financial company, for all aspects of its business with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others, with whom the Company conducts business or potential future business. Any negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, disseminated by word of mouth, by the general media, by electronic or social networking means, or by other methods, regarding, among other things, the Company\u2019s current or potential business practices or activities, cyber-security issues, regulatory compliance, an inability to meet obligations, employees, management or directors\u2019 ethical standards or actions, or about the banking industry in general, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation. Any damage to the Company\u2019s reputation could affect its ability to retain and develop the business relationships necessary to conduct business which in turn could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and shareholders\u2019 value.\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal Claims and Litigation. The Company is subject to legal challenges under a variety of circumstances in the course of its normal business practices in regards to laws and regulations, duties, customer expectations of service levels, in addition to potentially illegal activity (at a federal or state level) conducted by any of our customers, use of technology and patents, operational practices and those of contracted third-party service providers and vendors, and stockholder matters, among others. Regardless of the scope or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in litigation that could be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, and distracting to management. Whether claims or legal action are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, and/or adversely affect the market perception of our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Insurance Coverage May Not be Adequate to Prevent Additional Liabilities or Expenses. The Company maintains insurance policies that provide coverage for various risks at levels the Company deems adequate to provide reasonable coverage for losses. The coverage applies to incidents and events which may impact such areas as: loss of bank facilities; accidental injury or death of employees; injuries sustained on bank premises; cyber and technology attacks or breaches; loss of customer nonpublic personal information; processing of fraudulent transactions; robberies, embezzlement and theft; improper processing of negotiable items or electronic transactions; improper loan underwriting and perfection of collateral, among others. These policies will provide varying degrees of coverage for losses under specific circumstances, and in most cases after related deductible amounts are paid by the Company. However, there is no guarantee that the circumstance of an incident will meet the criteria for insurance coverage under a specific policy, and despite the insurance policies in place the Company may experience a loss incident or event which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Trading Volume in the Company\u2019s Common Stock is Less Than That of Larger Companies. Although the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ, the trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is substantially less than that of larger companies. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant purchases or sales of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of such purchases or sales, could cause significant volatility in the price for the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Market Price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock May Fluctuate Significantly, and This May Make it Difficult for Your to Resell Shares of Common Stock Owned by You at Times or at Prices You Find Attractive. The price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ constantly changes. The Company expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate, and the Company cannot give you any assurances regarding any trends in the market prices for its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include the Company\u2019s:\n\u25cf\npast and future dividend practice;\n\u25cf\nfinancial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in the Corporation\u2019s operating results or the quality of the Corporation\u2019s assets;\n\u25cf\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in expectations as to the Corporation\u2019s future financial performance;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by the Corporation or its competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to the Corporation;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of the Corporation\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u25cf\nthe credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u25cf\ninstability in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility, budget deficits or sovereign debt level concerns and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nIn addition, the banking industry may be more affected than other industries by certain economic, credit, regulatory or information security issues. Although the Company itself may or may not be directly impacted by such issues, the Company\u2019s stock price may vary due to the influence, both real and perceived, of these issues, among others, on the banking industry in general. Investment in the Company\u2019s stock is not insured against loss by the FDIC, or any other public or private entity. As a result, and for the other reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, if you acquire our common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nShareholder Dilution Could Occur if Additional Stock is Issued in the Future. If the Company\u2019s Board of Directors should determine in the future that there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, such issuances could result in dilution to existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interest. Similarly, if the Board of Directors decides to grant additional stock awards or options for the purchase of shares of common stock, the issuance of such additional stock awards and/or the issuance of additional shares upon the exercise of such options would expose stockholders to dilution.\nChanges in Accounting Standards Could Materially Impact the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations. From time to time, the FASB changes the accounting and reporting standards that govern the recording of financial transactions and preparation of financial statements. Future changes may be difficult to implement and may materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial transactions, financial condition, and results of operations and could impact the Company\u2019s business activities and strategy.\nChanges in Tax Policies at Both the Federal and State Levels Could Impact the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Enactment of new legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, may have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. A deferred tax asset is created by the tax effect of the differences between an asset\u2019s book value and its tax basis. The deferred tax asset is measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accordingly, a reduction in enacted tax rates may result in a decrease in current tax expense and a decrease to the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset, with an offsetting charge to current tax expense. The alternative would occur with an increase to enacted tax rates. In addition, certain tax strategies taken in the past derive their tax benefit from the current enacted tax rates. Accordingly, a change in enacted tax rates may result in a decrease/increase to anticipated benefit of the Company\u2019s previous transactions which in turn, could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operation Rely in Part on Management Estimates and Assumptions. In preparing the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, estimates and assumptions to be utilized. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and income and expenses for the years then ended. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment and other factors will be reflected in the financial statements and results of operations in future periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and be adversely affected should the assumptions and estimates used be incorrect, or change over time due to changes in circumstances.\nThe Company Relies on Dividends from the Bank for Substantially All of its Revenue. The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds used to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Company\u2019s subordinated debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. If the Bank, due to its capital position, inadequate net income levels, or otherwise, is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then the Company will be unable to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. The OCC also has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Bank\u2019s inability to pay dividends could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 89262, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "WNEB"}
