{"cik": "1296435", "company": "Neenah Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the risks described below relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate principally to our indebtedness. The remaining risks relate principally to the securities markets generally and ownership of our common stock.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, pandemic and measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the U.S., which has led to a decline in discretionary spending by consumers, which in turn has adversely impacted our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations since the second quarter of 2020. We cannot predict the degree to, or the time period over, which our sales and operations will continue to be affected by this pandemic and preventive measures.\nCOVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including imposition of quarantines, governmental vaccination mandates, and prolonged closures of manufacturing facilities and retail stores, may impact our business in a number of ways. These impacts could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, including potential disruptions to our supply chain,\nincreased administrative costs, the availability of raw materials and our ability to recruit and maintain the skilled workforce necessary to operate our businesses.\nCOVID-19 and its variants may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business operations and our financial results, including our net sales, earnings, and cash flows in the upcoming quarters. We expect the ultimate significance of the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial results, will be determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the duration, spread and intensity of COVID-19 and the impact of governmental regulations or guidelines in response to the pandemic. Although all of our global manufacturing facilities are currently operational and have been designated by governmental authorities as an \"essential business,\" in the future they may be required to curtail or cease production in response to the spread of COVID-19, either in response to changing governmental orders, labor availability or supply chain issues. In addition, our customers, distribution partners, service providers or suppliers may experience operational challenges, financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business or suffer disruptions in their business due to COVID-19, which would have a material negative impact on our business.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness, have impacted our ability to carry out our business as usual and materially adversely impacted global economic conditions, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even in those regions where we have experienced business recovery, should those regions fail to fully contain COVID-19 or suffer a COVID-19 relapse, those markets may not recover as quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.\nOur business will suffer if we are unable to effectively respond to decreased demand for some of our products due to conditions in the global economy, secular pressures in some markets or consumer preferences.\nWe have experienced and may experience in the future decreased demand for some of our products due to slowing or negative global economic growth, uncertainty in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence or preferences, fluctuating commodity prices, increased unemployment, and other challenges affecting the global economy. Parts of our fine paper and packaging business are subject to electronic substitution and, for fine paper products in particular, are in secular decline. Our efforts to offset these declines with new fine paper, consumer and packaging products and growth in existing fine paper and office products categories are not certain to fully offset the market declines, and an evaluation of the scope of our manufacturing footprint may be required in the future. In addition, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. If we are unable to implement business strategies to effectively respond to decreased demand for our products, our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges in international geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions generally, and particularly in Germany, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for products could result in reduced profits and sales.\nOur operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products, including the Eurozone countries (particularly Germany where we have significant operations), the U.K and Mexico. Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, or any change in social, political, macroeconomic or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results.\nHistorically, economic and market shifts, and fluctuations in capacity have created cyclical changes in prices, sales volume and gross profits for products in the paper, packaging and related industries. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. The overall levels of demand for many of our products reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and regional economic conditions in our markets (including Europe, Asia, and Central and South America), as well as foreign currency exchange rates. The foregoing factors could materially and adversely impact our sales, cash flows, profitability and results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes to the United States\u2019 participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs (including, but not limited to, the current United States tariffs on China and China's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the United States), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe availability of and prices for raw materials, energy and transportation services will significantly impact our business.\nWe purchase a substantial portion of the raw materials, energy, transportation and distribution services (primarily over-the-road freight) and other inputs necessary to produce our products on the open market, and, as a result, the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand, supply chain disruptions and government regulation. We do not have significant influence over our raw material, energy or transportation prices and our ability to pass increases in those costs along to our customers through selling price increases may be challenged. We have experienced and may experience in the future significant raw material, energy, transportation and other input cost increases and we may not be able to fully recover these incremental costs through selling price increases or our pricing actions may lag behind due to contractual quarterly adjusters or annual renewals. In addition, we may not be able to recoup other cost increases we may experience, such as those resulting from inflation or from increases in wages or salaries, health care, pension or other employee benefits costs, insurance costs and other costs.\nOur technical products business acquires certain specialized pulp from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty chemicals from a limited number of suppliers. In general, these supply arrangements are covered by formal contracts and represent multi-year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs. We expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future. In the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier, we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short-term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty chemicals. In addition, short-term disruptions in the global supply chain for our raw materials, as experienced in 2021, could negatively impact our ability to produce certain products which could adversely impact the mix and volume of products we can provide to our customers. In the event of a long-term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty chemicals, we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other specialty chemicals that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production.\nOur fine paper and packaging business acquires a substantial majority of the cotton fiber used in the production of certain branded bond paper products pursuant to annual agreements with two North American producers. The balance of our cotton fiber requirements are acquired through spot market purchases from a variety of other producers. We believe that a partial or total disruption in the production of cotton fibers at our two primary suppliers would increase our reliance on spot market purchases with a likely corresponding increase in cost.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate.\nOur operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Operating results could be adversely affected by general economic conditions causing a downturn in the market for paper products. Additional factors that could affect our results include, among others, changes in the market price of pulp, other raw materials and distribution/transportation services, the effects of competitive pricing pressures, production capacity levels and manufacturing yields, availability and cost of products from our suppliers, the gain or loss of significant customers, our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis, changes in the mix of products produced and sold, seasonal customer demand, the relative strength of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates and environmental costs. The timing and effect of the foregoing factors are difficult to predict, and these or other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results.\nWe face many competitors, several of which have greater financial and other resources.\nWe face competition in each of our business segments from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce lower priced alternative products that customers may use instead of our products. Some of our competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing, or research and development resources than we do. Greater financial resources and product development capabilities may also allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new opportunities or changes in customer requirements.\nOur businesses are significantly dependent on sales to their largest customers.\nSales to the largest customer of the fine paper and packaging business represented approximately 17 percent of segment sales in 2021. Sales to the technical products business's largest customer represented approximately 14 percent of sales for the segment in 2021. A significant loss of business from any of our major fine paper and packaging or technical products customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We are also subject to credit risk associated with our customer concentration. If one or more of our largest fine paper and packaging or technical products customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for services provided, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable.\nWe cannot be certain that our tax planning strategies will be effective and that our research and development tax credits and net operating losses will continue to be available.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $30.8 million of U.S. federal and $7.7 million of U.S. state research and development tax credits (\"R&D Credits\") which, if not used, will expire between 2029 and 2041 for the U.S. federal R&D Credits and between 2022 and 2036 for the state R&D Credits. Among the risks which could affect our ability to utilize our R&D Credits and other deferred tax assets include changes in global tax legislation which could adversely affect income tax rates and the timing and availability of deductions and tax credits in our consolidated income statement and liquidity. The availability of state net operating losses (NOLs) and federal or state tax credits to offset taxable income and income tax, respectively, could also be substantially reduced if we were to undergo an \"ownership change\" as defined within certain federal and state tax codes.\nWe are continuously undergoing examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") as well as taxing authorities in various state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The IRS and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported on our income tax returns. The IRS is currently conducting an audit of tax year 2018. We are also currently under audit in Germany for tax years 2015-17.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC Topic 740\"), as of December 31, 2021, we have recorded a liability of $8.5 million for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is \"more likely than not\" that the tax benefit reported on our income tax returns will not be realized. There can be no assurance, however, that the actual amount of unrealized deductions will not exceed the amounts we have recognized for uncertain tax positions.\nWe have significant obligations for pension and other post-employment benefits.\nWe have significant obligations for pension and other post-employment benefits which could require future funding beyond that which we have funded in the past or which we currently anticipate. At December 31, 2021, our projected pension benefit obligations were $434.7 million and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by $39.4 million. In addition, during 2021 we paid pension benefits for unfunded qualified, insurance backed and supplemental retirement plans of $5.0 million. At December 31, 2021, our projected other post-employment benefit obligations were $34.7 million. No assets have been set aside to satisfy our other post-employment benefit obligations. In 2021, we made payments for post-employment benefits other than pensions of $5.7 million. A material increase in funding requirements or benefit payments could have a material effect on our cash flows.\nLabor interruptions or shortages would adversely affect our business.\nExcept for our Pittsfield and Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Brownville, New York and Quakertown, Pennsylvania manufacturing facilities which are non-union, substantially all of our hourly employees are unionized. In addition, some key customers and suppliers are also unionized. Availability of labor and disruptions (including strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages or slowdowns) involving our employees, and/or those of our suppliers and customers, could have a material impact on us. In addition, the lack of availability of skilled labor, particularly in North America, at our facilities and/or those of our suppliers and customers, could have a material impact on us.\nIf we are unable to continue to implement our business strategies, our financial condition and operating results could be materially affected.\nOur future operating results will depend, in part, on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategies, including expansion and growth of our technical products (filtration and performance materials) and packaging businesses in a cost effective manner. Our strategies are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully integrate acquisitions and may be unable to achieve anticipated cost savings or other synergies.\nThe integration of the operations of acquired companies involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial, legal and operational challenges. We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating information systems, financial reporting activities, and integrating and retaining management and personnel from acquired companies. We may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or commercial or growth synergies, for a number of reasons, including contractual constraints and obligations or an inability to take advantage of expected commercial opportunities, increased operating efficiencies or commercial expansion of key technologies. Failure to successfully integrate acquired companies may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, which could harm our future success and competitive position.\nOur future success and competitive position also depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or may require us to license other companies' intellectual property rights. It is possible that any of our patents may be invalidated, rendered unenforceable, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others or any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. Further, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies or design around our patents, and steps taken by us to protect our technologies may not prevent misappropriation of such technologies.\nFuture dividends on our common stock may be restricted or eliminated.\nDividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and future dividends will depend on our future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements and other factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited under the terms of our credit agreements. Under the most restrictive terms of our credit agreements, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited, as described under \"Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness.\" There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.\nWe may be required to record a charge to our earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had goodwill of $198.6 million and net other intangible assets of $154.6 million. Goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment, and long-lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances warrant an impairment review. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, acceleration of the secular decline in fine paper and office products or a lack of success in our efforts to offset these declines with new fine paper and packaging products, which could lead to a reduction in the size of our manufacturing footprint, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any non-cash impairment would be recognized immediately through our consolidated statement of operations. Any future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nIf we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production and/or cost increases.\nOur technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses may suffer catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, mechanical failure, or other natural or man-made events. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, delay or reduce shipments, reduce revenue, and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. These expenses and losses may not be adequately covered by property or business interruption insurance. Even if covered by insurance, our inability to deliver our products to customers, even on a short-term basis, may cause us to lose market share on a more permanent basis.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results.\nOur technical products business in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands incurs most of its costs and sells most of its production in Europe and, therefore, its operations and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Changes in the Euro exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar will, however, have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet and reported results of operations. See Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Risk.\"\nIn addition, because we transact business in other foreign countries, some of our revenues and expenses are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of our operations. As a result, changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the transaction is denominated and the local currency of our operations into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction. This can result in more or less local currency revenues or costs related to such transaction, and thus have an effect on our reported sales and income before income taxes.\nOur activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could increase our costs, cause us to incur liabilities and adversely affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States, the U.K., Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Mexico and elsewhere in the world relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. The nature of our operations requires that we invest capital and incur operating costs to comply with those laws, regulations and ordinances and exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards. There is no assurance that significant additional expenditures will not be required to maintain compliance with, or satisfy potential claims arising from, such laws, regulations and ordinances. Future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs that could require significantly higher capital expenditures and operating costs, which would reduce the funds otherwise available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities or other purposes.\nAdditionally, in the U.S., portions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (\u201cMAP-21\u201d, primarily, the electronic logging device (ELD) rules under MAP-21) have reduced levels of capacity in the over-the-road freight sector which continue to have an adverse impact on our business. The current operating environment in the over-the-road freight\nand transportation sector resulting from fluctuating fuel costs, industry-specific regulations (such as hours-of-service and ELD rules), a shortage of qualified drivers, and other economic factors are causing a tightening of capacity and an increase in prices charged to shippers, such as us, in the over-the-road transportation and distribution sector generally, and in our carrier networks specifically, which continue to have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation and various cost and manufacturing issues associated with such legislation.\nGHG emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions is currently being considered not only in the U.S. at the federal and state level, but globally in each country where we operate. While not all are likely to become law, additional climate change related mandates will likely be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of compliance.\nAny failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions. These may include regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installing pollution control equipment or remedial actions, any of which could involve significant expenditures. Future development of such laws and regulations may require capital expenditures to ensure compliance. We may discover currently unknown environmental problems or conditions in relation to our past or present operations, or we may face unforeseen environmental liabilities in the future. These conditions and liabilities may require site remediation or other costs to maintain compliance or correct violations of environmental laws and regulations; or result in governmental or private claims for damage to person, property or the environment, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to fund our future capital requirements internally or obtain third-party financing.\nWe may be required or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing to meet our future working capital requirements, as well as to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. To the extent we must obtain financing from external sources to fund our capital requirements, we cannot guarantee financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including, but not limited to, extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital and/or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our future working capital requirements or fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, any of which could negatively affect our business. As of December 31, 2021, we have required debt payments of $6.4 million during the year ending December 31, 2022.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and other liabilities will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and other liabilities, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. There can be no assurance that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to repay our debt in the future. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt to meet our debt and other obligations, there can be no assurances as to the terms or timing of any such transaction.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022our senior secured lenders could terminate their commitments and commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines in the future or we breach our covenants under our credit agreements, we may need to obtain waivers from the lenders to avoid being in default. We may not be able to obtain these waivers. If this occurs, we would be in default under our credit agreements.\nWe have significant indebtedness which subjects us to restrictive covenants relating to the operation of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $447.8 million of debt under our Term Loan B, $0.9 million of revolving credit borrowings and $1.9 million of project financing outstanding. In addition, availability under our Global Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $146.1 million. Our leverage could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the Term Loan B and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage to our competitors;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain covenants restricting our ability to, among other things, pay dividends, incur certain additional debt, incur or create certain liens, make specified restricted payments, authorize or issue capital stock, enter into transactions with our affiliates, consolidate or merge with or acquire another business, sell certain of our assets or liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our Company. Refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for the current limitations on our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nSubject to certain exceptions, our Term Loan Credit Agreement contains provisions requiring mandatory prepayment of the term loan obligations from (a) net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course sales or other dispositions of assets, (b) net cash proceeds from the issuances of certain debt by the Company and subsidiaries, and (c) the Excess Cash Flow of the Company and its subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan B may not be reborrowed, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes. For more information on our liquidity, see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nChanges in interest rates or the phaseout of LIBOR may significantly increase our borrowing costs.\nOur Global Revolving Credit Facility and Term B Facility accrue interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our Global Revolving Credit Facility which matures on December 10, 2023 and $447.8 million of term loan borrowings which mature on April 6, 2028. We may reduce our exposure to rising interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements, although those arrangements may result in us incurring higher interest expenses than we would incur without the arrangements. If interest rates increase in the absence of such arrangements, we will need to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt. In addition, the variable interest rates on our Global Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B are based on LIBOR as a benchmark. LIBOR is the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In 2017, the United\nKingdom's Financial Conduct Authority the \"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to phase out LIBOR. On November 30, 2020 the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 30, 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. No consensus exists as to which reference rate or rates or benchmarks may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, has identified the secured overnight financing rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended alternative rate for all LIBOR. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the SOFR or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. Any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our Credit Agreements could result in an event of default that could cause acceleration of our indebtedness.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the credit agreements or our other debt instruments could cause an event of default under the relevant debt instrument. The occurrence of an event of default could trigger a default under our other debt instruments, prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable. Our assets or cash flows may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, and we may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness.\nBecause the terms of our credit agreements do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured. If we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we and they face may intensify.\nOur credit agreements are secured by a majority of our assets.\nOur principal credit agreements are secured by a majority of our assets. Availability under our Global Revolving Credit Facility will fluctuate over time depending on the value of our inventory, receivables and (in the case of the German Revolving Credit Facility) various capital assets. An extended work stoppage or decline in sales volumes would result in a decrease in the value of the assets securing the Global Revolving Credit Facility. A reduction in availability under the Global Revolving Credit Facility could have a material effect on our liquidity.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating assigned by the rating agencies will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries to generate cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, or\nupon loans, advances or other payments made by these entities to us. The ability of these entities to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt, including our credit agreements. These limitations are also subject to important exceptions and qualifications.\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend upon their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control as well as their ability to repatriate cash to us. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to help us satisfy our debt obligations, or if they are unable to distribute sufficient cash flow to us, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking to raise additional capital. Refinancing may not be possible, and any assets may not be saleable, or, if sold, we may not realize sufficient amounts from those sales. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or we may be prohibited from incurring it, if available, under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe outcome of legal actions and claims may adversely affect us.\nWe are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome of such legal actions and claims against us cannot be predicted with certainty. Legal actions and claims against us could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nESG issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the desirability of our stock, and may damage our reputation.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving investor, industry, or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, the desirability of our stock to investors, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Increased focus and activism on ESG topics may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. In particular, these constituencies are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, waste, and other sustainability concerns. These demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands. In addition to environmental issues, these constituencies are also focused on social and other governance issues, including matters such as, but not limited to, human capital and social issues. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environmental, human capital, or social issues, or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase risk of litigation.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology that manages operations and other business processes.\nWe use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store and report on our business and interact with customers, vendors and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third party providers, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions\nor misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. The U.S. Congress is considering cybersecurity legislation that, if enacted, could impose additional obligations on us and could expand our potential liability in the event of a cybersecurity incident.\nAdditionally, we collect, process, store, use and transmit personal data for use in our business, most of which relates to our global employees. Personal data is increasingly subject to legal and regulatory protections around the world, which vary widely in approach and which possibly conflict with one another. As discussed above, in recent years, U.S. legislators and regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, as well as U.S. states, have increased their focus on protecting personal data by law and regulation, and have increased enforcement actions for violations of privacy and data protection requirements. The General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective in the European Union in May 2018 intended to protect the privacy and security of personal data, including credit card information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the relevant jurisdiction. Implementation of and compliance with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could otherwise adversely affect our business operations, which could negatively impact our financial position or cash flows. Additionally, media coverage of data breaches has escalated, in part because of the increased number of enforcement actions, investigations and lawsuits. As this focus and attention on privacy and data protection increases, we also risk exposure to potential liabilities and costs resulting from the compliance with, or any failure to comply with applicable legal requirements, conflicts among these legal requirements or differences in approaches to privacy and security of data. Our business could be materially adversely affected by our inability, or the inability of our vendors who receive personal data from us, to comply with legal obligations regarding the use of personal data, new data handling requirements that conflict with or negatively impact our business practices.\nOur business may suffer if we do not retain our senior management and operations personnel.\nThe loss of members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of candidates with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ qualified personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, our future success requires us to continue to attract and retain competent personnel at all levels of the organization, notably in the manufacturing facilities and support functions.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute \"forward-looking\" statements as defined under the federal securities laws.
