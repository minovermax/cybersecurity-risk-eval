{"cik": "1606440", "company": "Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCommerce Union\u2019s decisions regarding credit risk and reserves for loan losses may materially and adversely affect its business.\nMaking loans and other extensions of credit is an essential element of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s business. Although Commerce Union Bank seeks to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, its loans and other extensions of credit may not be repaid. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe duration of the credit;\n\u2022\ncredit risks of a particular customer;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nCommerce Union Bank attempts to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for potential losses in its loan portfolio. Commerce Union Bank periodically determines the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nan ongoing review of the quality, mix, and size of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nCommerce Union Bank\u2019s historical loan loss experience;\n\u2022\nevaluation of economic conditions;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of loan delinquencies and loan portfolio quality; and\n\u2022\nthe amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans.\nThere is no precise method of predicting credit losses; therefore, Commerce Union Bank faces the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed its allowance for loan losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of Commerce Union\u2019s net income, and possibly its capital.\nFederal and state regulators periodically review Commerce Union Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require Commerce Union Bank to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of its management. Any increase in the amount of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s provision or loans charged-off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on its operating results.\nCommerce Union Bank may have higher loan losses than it has allowed for in its allowance for loan losses. Our loan portfolio includes, and will continue to include after the merger, a meaningful amount of real estate construction and development loans, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nCommerce Union Bank\u2019s actual loan losses could exceed its allowance for loan losses. Commerce Union Bank\u2019s average loan size continues to increase and reliance on its historic allowance for loan losses may not be adequate. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $160.7 million, or 65.6% of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s loan portfolio was composed of construction, commercial mortgage, and commercial loans. Repayment of such loans is generally considered more subject to market risk than residential mortgage loans. Industry experience shows that a portion of loans will become delinquent and a portion of loans will require partial or entire charge-off. Regardless of the underwriting criteria used, losses may be experienced as a result of various factors beyond Commerce Union Bank\u2019s control, including among other things, changes in market conditions affecting the value of loan collateral and problems affecting the credit of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s borrowers.\nBoth Commerce Union and Commerce Union Bank are subject to extensive regulation.\nCommerce Union and Commerce Union Bank are subject to extensive governmental regulation and control. Compliance with state and federal banking laws has a material effect on the business and operations of Commerce Union and Commerce Union Bank. Our operations are subject to state and federal banking laws, regulations, and procedures. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and are subject to interpretation, and management cannot predict the effects of these changes on Commerce Union\u2019s business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, the cost of compliance could adversely affect the ability of Commerce Union to operate profitably. Non-banking financial institutions, such as securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, and money market funds are now permitted to offer services which compete directly with services offered by banks. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nCombining the Commerce Union Bank and Reliant Bank may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized.\nCommerce Union and Reliant Bank have operated and, until the completion of the merger of Reliant Bank and Commerce Union bank, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the successful combination of the businesses of Commerce Union Bank and Reliant Bank. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, after the completion of the merger, Commerce Union Bank expects to integrate with Reliant\u2019s business. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the surviving company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. These transition matters could have an adverse effect on Commerce Union during the pre-merger period and for an undetermined amount of time after the completion of the merger. In addition, it is also possible that clients, customers, depositors and counterparties of Commerce Union or Reliant Bank could choose to discontinue their relationships with Commerce Union after the merger is completed because they prefer doing business with an independent company or for any other reason, which would have an adverse effect on Commerce Union\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If Commerce Union experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIf the merger is completed, Commerce Union expects to incur substantial expenses related to the merger that could adversely affect its business after the merger.\nCommerce Union expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with completion of the merger and combining Commerce Union Bank\u2019s business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with those of Reliant Bank. Although Commerce Union has assumed that a certain level of transaction and combination expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our expenses. Many of our expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Due to these factors, the transaction and combination expenses associated with the merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that Commerce Union expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the combination of the businesses following the completion of the merger. As a result of these expenses, Commerce Union expects to take charges against their earnings before and after the completion of the merger. The charges taken in connection with the merger are expected to be significant, although the aggregate amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nThe market price of Commerce Union common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of Reliant Bank or Commerce Union currently.\nUpon completion of the merger, holders of Reliant Bank common stock will become holders of Commerce Union common stock. Commerce Union\u2019s business differs in certain important respects from that of Reliant Bank, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Commerce Union common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of Commerce Union\u2019s operations.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Commerce Union. These uncertainties may impair Commerce Union\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Commerce Union to seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees by Commerce Union may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Commerce Union. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Commerce Union, Commerce Union\u2019s business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, each of Commerce Union and Reliant has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing.\nIf the merger is not completed, Commerce Union will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nCommerce Union has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Commerce Union would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by them. For example, in the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA: (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers\u2019 nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of the institution\u2019s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches.\nMoreover, various United States federal banking regulatory agencies, states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our payment. In many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches.\nFurthermore, legislators and/or regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer and/or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation and our brand.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.\nWe maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. We cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties and reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCommerce Union Bank\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community based businesses may increase Commerce Union\u2019s credit risk.\nMost of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the markets in which Commerce Union Bank operates negatively impact this important customer sector, results of operations and financial condition and the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by Commerce Union in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of Commerce Union Bank\u2019s borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with Commerce Union, which could have a material adverse effect on Commerce Union\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBoth Commerce Union and Reliant are geographically concentrated in middle Tennessee and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability.\nWe currently operate primarily in the Nashville, Tennessee MSA, and most of our loan, deposit and other customers live or have operations in this area. Accordingly, our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in this market, along with the continued attraction of business ventures to the areas, and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in this market. We cannot assure you that economic conditions, including loan demand, in our market will improve during 2015, or thereafter, and in that case, we may not be able to grow our loan portfolio in line with our expectations. In addition, the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us may be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nCompared to regional or national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or return of more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nCommerce Union faces strong competition for customers, which could prevent it from obtaining customers and may cause it to pay higher interest rates to attract customers.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and Commerce Union Bank experiences competition in its market from many other financial institutions. Commerce Union Bank competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other super-regional, national, and international financial institutions that operate offices in Commerce Union\u2019s primary market areas and elsewhere. Commerce Union competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, Commerce Union has to attract its customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents and businesses that have relocated to the Nashville, Tennessee, MSA. Many of Commerce Union\u2019s competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services, such as extensive and established branch networks, that Commerce Union does not provide. There is a risk that Commerce Union will not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in Commerce Union\u2019s market, and that it may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to Commerce Union.\nCommerce Union\u2019s deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its future earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as Commerce Union Bank, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. Recent market developments and bank failures significantly depleted the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments, which increase or decrease a bank\u2019s overall assessment rate. This has resulted in increases to the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for many insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the Deposit Insurance Fund to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. Commerce Union is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that Commerce Union Bank is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, Commerce Union Bank may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce Commerce Union Bank\u2019s profitability, may limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact its operations.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may reduce Commerce Union\u2019s profitability.\nCommerce Union\u2019s results of operations depend in large part upon the level of its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets, such as loans and MBSs, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings. Depending on the terms and maturities of Commerce Union\u2019s assets and liabilities, Commerce Union believes it is more likely than not a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its profitability. Many factors cause changes in interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. While Commerce Union intends to manage the effects of changes in interest rates by adjusting the terms, maturities, and pricing of its assets and liabilities, its efforts may not be effective and its financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nCommerce Union is dependent on key individuals, and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail its growth and adversely affect its prospects.\nCommerce Union and Commerce Union Bank are materially dependent on the performance of the executive management team, loan officers, and other support personnel. Following the merger, Commerce Union will continue to be dependent on these officers and employees, in addition to the services of Reliant\u2019s executive team, including the president and chief executive officer of Reliant, and Reliant\u2019s chief financial officer. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business of Commerce Union, results of operations, and financial condition, either before or after the merger. Many of these key officers have important customer relationships, which are instrumental to Commerce Union\u2019s operations. Changes in key personnel and\ntheir responsibilities may be disruptive to Commerce Union Bank\u2019s business and could have a material adverse effect on Commerce Union Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations, either before or after the merger. Management believes that future results also will depend in part upon attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management, especially in the new market areas into which Commerce Union may enter, as well as sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and management cannot be sure that Commerce Union will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel.\nCommerce Union is an emerging growth company, and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make Commerce Union\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nCommerce Union is subject to periodic reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Commerce Union is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, however, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if Commerce Union complies with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies immediately after this offering, Commerce Union may avail itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as it is an emerging growth company. Commerce Union will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though it may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million) or if Commerce Union\u2019s total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion in a fiscal year. Commerce Union cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find Commerce Union\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Commerce Union\u2019s common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nFurther, the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. Commerce Union has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, Commerce Union, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make Commerce Union\u2019s financial statements not comparable with those of another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and recently adopted capital rules is uncertain.\nOn September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement to a strengthened set of capital requirements for internationally active banking organizations in the U.S. and around the world, known as Basel III. Basel III called for increases in the requirements for minimum common equity, minimum Tier 1 capital and minimum total capital for certain systemically important financial institutions, to be phased in over time until fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The final rules were adopted by the federal banking agencies in July 2013.\nThe rules add a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio minimum of 4.5%, increase the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, and decrease the Tier 2 capital that may be included in calculating total risk-based capital from 4.0% to 2.0%. The final rules also introduce a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the Tier 1 and total\nrisk-based capital requirements. The required minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets will remain 8.0% and the minimum leverage ratio will remain 4.0%. The new risk-based capital requirements (except for the capital conservation buffer) will become effective for Commerce Union on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nThe final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses and instruments that will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital. The final rules also set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets that Commerce Union was required to implement beginning January 1, 2015.\nIn addition to the updated capital requirements, the final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework. Beginning January 1, 2015, the minimum ratios to be considered well-capitalized will be updated to increase the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from 6.0% to 8.0%, in addition to the requirement to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, regulators of banks and bank holding companies have become more likely to impose capital requirements on bank holding companies and banks that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Commerce Union and Commerce Union Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the issuance of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if Commerce Union were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nInterest rate movements, inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our mortgage banking business.\nOur financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business, including interest rate levels, the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans. Our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations. We also may experience market losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans. Increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows. Our mortgage loan operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels, job growth, and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing, one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels. Our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgage-backed securities, and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market. In the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans, we could experience a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, and stock performance.\nIf the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient, our profit could decrease and we may incur losses.\nWe provide several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their homes. We sell a large number of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market, and those loans are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards, we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs. In the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements, we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investors or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred. This may result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nThe new \u201cability-to-repay\u201d and \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rules could have a negative impact on our loan origination process and foreclosure proceedings.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, has adopted rules that are likely to impact our residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally including rules that implement the \u201cability-to-repay\u201d requirement and provide protection from liability for \u201cqualified mortgages,\u201d as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability-to-repay rule, which took effect on January 10, 2014, requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance \u201csafe harbor\u201d for lenders that issue certain \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d The rules define a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. While \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance will attach to mortgages that also meet the definition of a \u201chigher priced mortgage\u201d (which are generally subprime loans). Although the new \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rules may provide better definition and more certainty regarding regulatory requirements, the rules may also increase our compliance burden and reduce our lending flexibility and discretion, which could negatively impact our ability to originate new loans and the cost of originating new loans. Any loans that we make outside of the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d criteria could expose us to an increased risk of liability and reduce or delay our ability to foreclose on the underlying property. Additionally, qualified \u201chigher priced mortgages\u201d only provide a rebuttable presumption of compliance and thus may be more susceptible to challenges from borrowers. It is difficult to predict how the CFPB\u2019s \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rules will impact us, but any decreases in loan origination volume or increases in compliance and foreclosure costs could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCommerce Union\u2019s historical operating results may not be indicative of its future operating results.\nCommerce Union may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth, and, consequently, Commerce Union\u2019s historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of its future operations. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, and competition, may also impede Commerce Union\u2019s ability to expand its market presence. If Commerce Union experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, Commerce Union\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of its operating costs are fixed expenses.\nCommerce Union may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Commerce Union has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose Commerce Union to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, Commerce Union\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the bank cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to Commerce Union Bank. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Commerce Union\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCommerce Union\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and Commerce Union may be unable to pay future dividends even if it desires to do so.\nThe Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital requirements, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policies\nalso require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. In addition, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect Commerce Union\u2019s ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nCommerce Union\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by regulatory restrictions, by Commerce Union Bank\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends to Commerce Union and by Commerce Union\u2019s need to maintain sufficient capital to support Commerce Union\u2019s operations. A Tennessee chartered bank may, with the approval of the TDFI, transfer funds from its surplus account to the undivided profits (retained earnings) account or any part of its paid-in-capital account. The payment of dividends by any bank is dependent upon its earnings and financial condition and, in addition to the limitations referred to above, is subject to the statutory power of certain federal and state regulatory agencies to act to prevent what they deem unsafe or unsound banking practices. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of Commerce Union Bank, be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Without regulatory approval, a dividend only can be paid to the extent of the net income of the bank for that year plus the net income of the prior two years. The FDIA prohibits a state bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, from paying dividends if it is in default in the payment of any assessments due the FDIC.\nIf Commerce Union Bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to Commerce Union, it is unlikely that Commerce Union would be able to pay cash dividends on Commerce Union\u2019s common stock. Moreover, holders of Commerce Union\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when and if declared by Commerce Union\u2019s board of directors. Although Commerce Union has paid cash dividends on its common stock in recent years, Commerce Union is not required to do so, and Commerce Union\u2019s board of directors could reduce or eliminate Commerce Union\u2019s common stock dividend in the future.\nCommerce Union\u2019s common stock may not be listed on a national securities exchange, and the market for Commerce Union\u2019s common stock may not be more active than the market for either Commerce Union or Reliant common stock.\nAlthough we have applied to list the Commerce Union common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, we cannot guarantee that our stock will be listed on NASDAQ or any other exchange. Accordingly, although the Commerce Union common stock offered in the merger will be freely transferable once you receive your Commerce Union stock certificate, Commerce Union\u2019s common stock may not be listed on a national securities exchange. Instead, the Commerce Union common stock may be traded in local over-the-counter markets and privately negotiated transactions. Although the common stock is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace, there is very limited trading in our shares. There is no assurance that an active public trading market for Commerce Union\u2019s common stock will develop. Further, we cannot assure you that significant trading in Commerce Union\u2019s common stock will take place for several years, if ever. Investors should consider their shares of Commerce Union common stock as a long-term investment because, among other things, they may not be able to promptly liquidate their investment at a reasonable price in the event of a personal financial emergency or otherwise.\nCommerce Union\u2019s stock price may fluctuate, which could result in losses to its investors and litigation against Commerce Union.\nCommerce Union\u2019s stock price could fluctuate in the future, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, Commerce Union\u2019s announcement of developments related to its businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors, news reports of trends, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, new federal banking regulations, and other issues related to the financial services industry. Commerce Union\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of Commerce Union\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not\nbe indicative of future market prices. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for Commerce Union\u2019s shareholders to resell their common stock when desired and at prices they find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Commerce Union could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from Commerce Union\u2019s normal business.\nEconomic and other circumstances may require Commerce Union to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to it. If Commerce Union has to issue shares of common stock, the issuance will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of Commerce Union\u2019s common stock and adversely affect the terms on which Commerce Union may obtain additional capital.\nCommerce Union may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or to strengthen its capital position. Commerce Union\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and Commerce Union\u2019s financial performance. Commerce Union cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to Commerce Union on acceptable terms or at all, or if Commerce Union does raise additional capital that it will not be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nIf Commerce Union determines, for any reason, that it needs to raise capital, Commerce Union\u2019s board of directors generally has the authority, without action by or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose, including issuance of equity based incentives under or outside of Commerce Union\u2019s equity compensation plans. (Assuming that Commerce Union\u2019s stock is listed on NASDAQ, this ability to issue securities will be subject to certain NASDAQ rules.) Additionally, Commerce Union is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of Commerce Union\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by Commerce Union of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur. If Commerce Union issues preferred stock that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if Commerce Union issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of Commerce Union\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected. Any issuance of additional shares of stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of Commerce Union\u2019s shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of its common stock. Shares Commerce Union issues in connection with any such offering will increase the total number of shares and may dilute the economic and voting ownership interest of Commerce Union\u2019s existing shareholders.\nA failure in or breach of Commerce Union\u2019s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of Commerce Union\u2019s third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt Commerce Union\u2019s businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.\nCommerce Union relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as Commerce Union have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime (both domestic and international), hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As customer, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, Commerce Union\u2019s operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Commerce Union\u2019s business, financial, accounting, and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Commerce Union\u2019s control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunication outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and as described below, cyber attacks.\nAs noted above, Commerce Union\u2019s business relies on its digital technologies, computer and e-mail systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. Although Commerce Union has information security procedures and controls in place, Commerce Union\u2019s technologies, systems and networks and its customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of Commerce Union\u2019s or its customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 confidential information. Third parties with whom Commerce Union does business or that facilitate Commerce Union\u2019s business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide service or security solutions for Commerce Union\u2019s operations, and other unaffiliated third parties, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to Commerce Union, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile Commerce Union has business continuity and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Commerce Union\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of Commerce Union\u2019s controls, processes, and practices designed to protect its systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for Commerce Union. As threats continue to evolve, Commerce Union may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support Commerce Union\u2019s businesses and clients, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that Commerce Union\u2019s clients use to access Commerce Union\u2019s products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputation damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material effect on Commerce Union\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nNegative public opinion surrounding Commerce Union and the financial institutions industry generally could damage Commerce Union\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to Commerce Union\u2019s business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding Commerce Union and the financial institutions industry generally, is inherent in Commerce Union\u2019s business. Negative public opinion can result from Commerce Union\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Commerce Union\u2019s ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Although Commerce Union takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of Commerce Union\u2019s business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAs a smaller company, it may be difficult for us to attract or retain the interest of equity research analysts. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity of and market price of our common stock. We will not have any control over the equity research analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nShares of Commerce Union common stock are not FDIC insured.\nShares of Commerce Union common stock are not deposits with a bank and are not insured by the FDIC.", "PERMNO": 15505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RBNC"}
