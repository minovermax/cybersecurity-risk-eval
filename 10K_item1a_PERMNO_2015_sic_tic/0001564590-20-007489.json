As is typical with distribution businesses, we experience a high rate of turnover among the part-time sales representatives, which requires us to attract, retain and motivate a large number of sales representatives. Recruiting is performed by current sales representatives, and the effectiveness of recruiting is generally dependent upon our reputation as a provider of a rewarding and potentially lucrative income opportunity, as well as the general competitive and economic environment. Whether recruits are motivated to complete their training and licensing requirements and commit to selling our products is largely dependent upon the effectiveness of our compensation and promotional programs, as well as the competitiveness of such programs compared with other companies, including other part-time business opportunities and the recruits\u2019 desire to help middle-income families in their communities become educated about their finances and assist them in identifying products that provide income protection and savings opportunities.\nIf our new business opportunity and the products we distribute do not generate sufficient interest to attract new recruits, motivate them to become licensed sales representatives and maintain their licenses, and incentivize them to sell our products and recruit other new sales representatives, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nCertain key RVPs have large sales organizations that include thousands of sales representatives. These key RVPs are responsible for attracting, motivating, supporting and assisting the sales representatives in their sales organizations. The loss of one or more key RVPs together with a substantial number of their sales representatives for any reason could materially adversely affect our financial results and could impair our ability to attract new sales representatives.\nFurthermore, if we or any other businesses with a similar distribution structure engage in practices resulting in increased negative public attention for our business model, the resulting reputational challenges could adversely affect our ability to attract new recruits. Companies such as ours that use independent agents to sell directly to customers can be the subject of negative commentary on website postings, social media and other non-traditional media. This negative commentary can spread inaccurate or incomplete information about distribution companies in general or our Company in particular, which can make our recruiting more difficult.\nFrom time to time, various jurisdictions make changes to the state or provincial licensing examination process that may make it more difficult for sales representatives to obtain their life insurance and/or securities licenses. FINRA restructured its representative-level securities qualification examination program in October 2018 to include a new Securities Industry Essentials exam. We have made enhancements to our securities licensing preparation process, but the restructured program could ultimately result in a decrease in the number of U.S. representatives obtaining their securities licenses in the United States. Further, in September 2018, FINRA requested comments from member firms on potential changes under consideration to the continuing education (\u201cCE\u201d) requirements. The proposals under consideration include changing the CE regulatory requirement from a three-year period to an annual requirement for securities-licensed representatives. Such a change could place an increased burden on representatives to complete their CE regulatory requirement more frequently, which could negatively impact the size of the active securities sales force in the event that representatives do not complete the CE requirement on a timely basis.\nThere are a number of laws and regulations that could apply to our distribution model, which could require us to modify our distribution structure.\nIn the past, certain distribution models that use independent agents to sell directly to customers have been subject to challenge under various laws, including laws relating to business opportunities, franchising and unfair or deceptive trade practices.\nIn general, state business opportunity and franchise laws in the United States prohibit sales of business opportunities or franchises unless the seller provides potential purchasers with a pre-sale disclosure document that has first been filed with a designated state agency and grants purchasers certain legal recourse against sellers of business opportunities and franchises. Certain Canadian provinces have enacted legislation dealing with franchising, which typically requires mandatory disclosure to prospective franchisees.\nWe have not been, and are not currently, subject to business opportunity laws because the amounts paid by the new sales representatives to us: (i) are less than the minimum thresholds set by many state and provincial statutes and (ii) are not fees paid for the right to participate in a business, but rather are for bona fide expenses such as state and provincial-required insurance examinations and pre-licensing training. We have not been, and are not currently, subject to franchise laws for similar reasons. However, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change. In addition, although we do not believe that the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\")'s Business Opportunity Rule applies to our Company, it could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Becoming subject to business opportunity or franchise laws or regulations could require us to provide additional disclosures and regulate the manner in which we recruit sales representatives that may increase the expense of, or adversely impact our recruitment of new sales representatives.\nThere are various laws and regulations, including laws of general application such as the Federal Trade Commission Act (the \u201cFTC Act\u201d), that prohibit fraudulent or deceptive practices including but not limited to pyramid schemes. Historically, the FTC has defined a pyramid scheme as an arrangement in which new participants are required to pay a fee for the right to sell a product and the right to receive, for recruiting other persons to participate, rewards that are primarily unrelated to the sale of products to ultimate users. The application of these laws and regulations to a given set of business practices is inherently fact-based and, therefore, is subject to interpretation by applicable enforcement authorities. Although we believe that our business practices comply with applicable laws and regulations, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment, or that these laws and regulations could change in actuality or in application, which could require us to restructure our operations or result in regulatory fines, penalties, or other costs, or reputational harm or could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are also federal, state and provincial laws of general application, including the FTC Act, and state or provincial unfair and deceptive trade practices laws that could potentially be invoked to challenge aspects of our recruiting of sales representatives. In particular, our recruiting efforts include promotional materials for recruits that describe the potential business opportunity available to them if they become sales representatives. These materials, as well as our other recruiting efforts and those of the sales representatives, particularly with respect to earnings and lifestyle statements, are subject to scrutiny by the FTC and other federal, state and provincial regulatory authorities. If statements made by us or by the sales representatives are deemed to be unfair, deceptive, or misleading, it could result in violations of the FTC Act or other federal, state and provincial laws or regulations could result in regulatory fines, penalties or other costs, or reputational harm, or could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBeing subject to, or out of compliance with, the aforementioned laws and regulations could require us to change our distribution structure, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere may be adverse tax, legal or financial consequences if the independent contractor status of sales representatives is overturned.\nSales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses. In the past, we have been successful in defending our Company in various contexts before courts and governmental agencies against claims that sales representatives should be treated like employees. Although we believe that we have properly classified sales representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS, the Canada Revenue Agency, a court or other authority will take a different view. Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation.\nThe classification of workers as independent contractors has been the subject of increasing federal, state and provincial legislative, regulatory and judicial interest over the last several years. In some jurisdictions, legislative proposals have been introduced and judicial decisions have been made that call for or result in greater scrutiny of independent contractor classifications. For example, in 2019 California enacted legislation revising its worker classification test. Although the California legislation excepted specified occupations and activities such as insurance and securities distribution, there can be no assurance that other legislative or regulatory proposals in California or other states would include similar exceptions. Legislation relating to independent contractor classifications has been proposed by other states and by members of the U.S. Congress. We cannot predict the outcome of any such legislative, regulatory, or judicial activity.\nIf there is an adverse determination with respect to the classification of some or all of the independent contractors by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments, retirement plan contributions and recordkeeping, employee benefits, payment of wages or modification of our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with federal, state, or provincial laws.\nThe Company\u2019s or the independent sales representatives' violation of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations and related claims and proceedings could expose us to material liabilities.\nExtensive federal, state, provincial and territorial laws regulate our product offerings and our relationships with our clients, imposing certain requirements that sales representatives must follow. At any given time, we may have pending state, federal or provincial examinations or inquiries of our investment and savings products, insurance and other businesses. In addition to imposing requirements that sales representatives must follow in their dealings with clients, these laws and regulations generally require us to maintain a system of supervision reasonably designed to ensure that sales representatives comply with the requirements to which they are subject. We have policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations. However, despite these compliance and supervisory efforts, the breadth of our operations and the broad regulatory requirements could result in oversight failures and instances of non-compliance on the part of the Company or the sales representatives.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to private litigation as a result of alleged misconduct by sales representatives. Examples include claims that a sales representative's failure to disclose underwriting-related information regarding the insured on an insurance application resulted in the denial of a life insurance policy claim, and with respect to investment and savings products sales, errors or omissions that a sales representative made in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities product. Non-compliance with laws or regulations by the sales representatives could result in adverse findings in either examinations or litigation and could subject us to sanctions, monetary liabilities, restrictions on or the loss of the operation of our business, or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuant to federal, state and provincial laws, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Many sales representatives, employees, and third-party service providers have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients on paper and on personal and company-owned hardware, the cloud and mobile devices through a variety of media, including the Internet and software applications. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our Company, our employees and the sales representatives. If a sales representative, employee, or third-party service provider intentionally or unintentionally discloses or misappropriates confidential client information or our data is the subject of a cybersecurity attack, or if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or sales representatives, employees, or service providers fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Insurance Business and Reinsurance\nWe may face significant losses if our actual experience differs from our expectations regarding mortality or persistency.\nWe set prices for life insurance policies based upon expected claim payment patterns derived from assumptions we make about the mortality rates, or likelihood of death, of our policyholders in any given year. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual mortality rates compare to our pricing assumptions. For example, if mortality rates are higher than those assumed in our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make more death benefit payments under our life insurance policies or to make such payments sooner than we had projected, which may decrease the profitability of our term life insurance products and result in an increase in the cost of our subsequent reinsurance transactions.\nThe prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance products are also based, in part, upon assumptions related to persistency. Actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. Actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability in the later years of a block of policies because the anticipated claims experience is higher in these later years. If actual persistency is significantly different from that assumed in our pricing assumptions, our reserves for future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate. We are precluded from adjusting premiums on our in-force business during the initial term of the policies, and our ability to adjust premiums on in-force business after the initial policy term is limited to the maximum premium rates in the policy.\nOur assumptions and estimates regarding mortality and persistency require us to make numerous judgments and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual persistency or ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claim payments on a block of policies, the timing of those payments, or whether the assets supporting these contingent future payment obligations will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of claims. If we conclude, based on our current expectations for mortality, persistency and other assumptions, that our future policy benefit reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover actual or expected claims payments and the scheduled amortization of our deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\"), we would be required to first accelerate our amortization of DAC and then increase our future policy benefit reserves in the period in which we make the determination, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of a catastrophic event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events, which could cause a large number of premature deaths of our insureds. A catastrophic event could also cause significant volatility in global financial markets and disrupt the economy. Although we have ceded a significant majority of our mortality risk to reinsurers, a catastrophic event could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims resulting from a catastrophic event could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any quarter or year and could also materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, which would increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new business could also be adversely affected.\nIn addition, most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business require life insurers to participate in guaranty associations, which raise funds to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed issuers. It is possible that a catastrophic event could require extraordinary assessments on our insurance companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance business is highly regulated, and statutory and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLife insurance statutes and regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of the public and policyholders. Those interests may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. Currently, in the United States, the power to regulate insurance resides almost exclusively with the states. The laws of the various U.S. jurisdictions grant state insurance regulators broad powers to regulate almost all aspects of our insurance business. Much of this state regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the NAIC, which is composed of the insurance commissioners of each U.S. jurisdiction. The NAIC re-examines and amends existing model laws and regulations (including holding company regulations) in addition to determining whether new ones are needed.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office and authorized it to, among other things, study methods to modernize and improve insurance regulation. We cannot predict with certainty whether, or in what form, reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will materially affect our business. Changes in federal statutes, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, in addition to changes to state statutes and regulations, may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 18, 2018, the NYDFS issued final amendments to its suitability regulation for annuities (the \u201cAmended Suitability Rule\u201d), which imposes certain duties and obligations on insurers and insurance producers in the sale of life insurance, including term life insurance, and annuities. Under the Amended Suitability Rule, the NYDFS requires firms and insurance representatives to ensure that transactions are suitable and consistent with the customer\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d. Because the Amended Suitability Rule imposes a higher standard of care and enhanced disclosure and other obligations on life and annuities transactions, it may increase our regulatory or litigation risk. The Amended Suitability Rule does not necessitate significant changes to our term life insurance or annuities business in New York. The Amended Suitability Rule became effective for annuity products on August 1, 2019 and will become effective for life insurance products on February 1, 2020.\nFederal and provincial insurance laws regulate all aspects of our Canadian insurance business. Changes to federal or provincial statutes and regulations may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\u201cOSFI\u201d) determines that our corporate actions do not comply with applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada could face sanctions or fines, and Primerica Life Canada could be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI.\nWe received approval from the Minister of Finance (Canada) under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) in connection with our indirect acquisition of Primerica Life Canada. The Minister expects that a person controlling a federal insurance company will provide ongoing financial, managerial or operational support to its subsidiary should such support prove necessary. This ongoing support may take the form of additional capital, the provision of managerial expertise or the provision of support in such areas as risk management, internal control systems and training. In the event that OSFI determines Primerica Life Canada is not receiving adequate support from the Parent Company under applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada may be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI.\nIf there were to be extraordinary changes to statutory or regulatory requirements in the United States or Canada, we may be unable to fully comply with or maintain all required insurance licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have all requisite licenses and approvals, or do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance activities or impose fines or penalties on us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation or regulatory initiatives may have on the conduct of our business.\nA decline in the regulatory capital ratios of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and ratings agencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC standards (imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile). The RBC formula for U.S. life insurance companies generally establishes capital requirements relating to asset, insurance, interest rate and business risks. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to report their results of RBC calculations annually to the applicable state department of insurance and the NAIC. Our Canadian life insurance subsidiary is subject to the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test Guideline (\u201cLICAT\u201d), and is required to provide its capital ratio calculations to the Canadian regulators. The capitalization of our insurance subsidiaries is maintained at levels in excess of the effective minimum requirements of the NAIC in the United States and OSFI in Canada. In any particular year, statutory capital and surplus amounts and RBC and LICAT ratios may increase or decrease\ndepending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries, the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in their reserve requirements, the value of securities in their investment portfolios, the credit ratings of investments held in their portfolios, changes in interest rates, credit market volatility, changes in consumer behavior, as well as changes to the NAIC's RBC formula or the LICAT calculation of OSFI. Many of these factors are outside of our control.\nOur financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC and LICAT ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. Ratings agencies may change their internal models, effectively increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to maintain their current ratings. Further, errors in programming, data entry, or our calculations could impact the accuracy of our estimates. Ratings agencies also may downgrade the ratings of securities held in our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 portfolios, which could result in a reduction of our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 statutory capital and surplus and RBC. There is no assurance that our insurance subsidiaries will not need additional capital or, if needed, that we will be able to provide it to maintain the targeted RBC and LICAT levels to support their business operations.\nThe failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC and LICAT requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A decline in RBC or LICAT also limits the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions and could be a factor in causing ratings agencies to downgrade the financial strength ratings of all our insurance subsidiaries. Such downgrades would have an adverse effect on our ability to write new insurance policies and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant ratings downgrade by a ratings organization could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries, with the exception of Peach Re and Vidalia Re, has been assigned a financial strength rating by A.M. Best. Primerica Life currently also has an insurer financial strength rating from each of Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\nThe financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review using, among other things, the ratings agencies' proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and are not intended for the protection of stockholders or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities. Our financial strength ratings will affect our competitive position relative to other insurance companies. If the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries fall below certain levels, some of our policyholders may move their business to our competitors. In addition, the models used by ratings agencies to determine financial strength are different from the capital requirements set by insurance regulators.\nRatings organizations review the financial performance and financial conditions of insurance companies, and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. A significant downgrade in the financial strength ratings of any of our insurance subsidiaries, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things:\n\u2022\nreducing sales of insurance products;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our relationships with sales representatives;\n\u2022\nmaterially increasing the amount of policy cancellations by our policyholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to reduce prices to remain competitive; and\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all.\nIf the rating agencies or regulators change their approach to financial strength ratings and statutory capital requirements, we may need to take action to maintain current ratings and capital adequacy ratios, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, the Parent Company currently has investment grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and A.M. Best. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations and are important factors in its ability to access liquidity in the debt markets. A rating downgrade by a rating agency can occur at any time if the rating agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition, results of operations or ability to service debt. If such a downgrade occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital in the unsecured debt market and potentially increasing the cost of such debt.\nThe failure by any of our reinsurers or reserve financing counterparties to perform its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe extensively use reinsurance in the United States to diversify our risk and to manage our loss exposure to mortality risk. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. We, as the insurer, are required to pay the full amount of death benefits even in circumstances where we are entitled to receive payments from the reinsurer. Due to factors such as insolvency, adverse underwriting results or inadequate investment returns, our reinsurers may not be able to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all. Further, reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them or might delay payment. Since death benefit claims may be paid long after a policy is issued, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. Any such failure to pay by our reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. On March 6, 2019 Scottish Re (U.S.), Inc. (\u201cScottish Re\u201d) was ordered into receivership for purposes of rehabilitation. While it is uncertain at this time how much of their claim obligations Scottish Re will ultimately be able to pay, we have recognized an allowance for all reinsurance recoverable balances from Scottish Re, which resulted in the recognition of an immaterial loss in our 2019 results of operations.\nWe also have in place coinsurance agreements that we originally entered into at the time of our IPO, pursuant to which we ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. Under this arrangement, our existing reinsurance agreements remain in place. Each coinsurer entered into trust agreements with our respective insurance subsidiaries and a trustee pursuant to which the coinsurer placed assets (primarily treasury and fixed-income securities) in trust for such subsidiary's benefit to secure the coinsurer's obligations to such subsidiary. Each such coinsurance agreement requires each coinsurer to maintain assets in trust, which amount will not be less than the amount of the reserves for the coinsured liabilities. In Canada, the IPO reinsurer must hold pledged assets in an amount sufficient for us to take credit for reinsurance in a Canadian financial institution, not affiliated with the IPO reinsurer, with our Canadian insurance company having an enforceable security interest that has priority over any other security interest for the pledged assets. Furthermore, our insurance subsidiaries have the right to recapture the business upon the occurrence of an event of default under their respective coinsurance agreement subject to any applicable cure periods. While any such recapture would be at no cost to us, such recapture would result in a substantial increase in our insurance exposure and require us to be fully responsible for the management of the assets set aside to support statutory reserves. The type of assets we might obtain as a result of a recapture may not be as liquid as our current invested asset portfolio and could result in an unfavorable impact on our risk profile.\nThere is no assurance that the relevant coinsurer will pay the coinsurance obligations owed to us now or in the future or that it will pay these obligations on a timely basis. If any of the coinsurers becomes insolvent, the trust account to support the obligations of such coinsurer is insufficient to pay such coinsurer's obligations to us and we fail to enforce our right to recapture the business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into transactions by which we finance redundant statutory reserves of certain issue years of our term life insurance business. Under these transactions, we pay a fee to financial counterparties for their commitment to support redundant reserves and provide corresponding statutory reinsurance credit, allowing us to more efficiently manage our capital. While we monitor the credit quality and financial strength of these counterparties, if their financial strength was significantly impaired to the extent that their support of our redundant reserves could no longer be relied upon, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Investments and Savings Products Business\nOur Investment and Savings Products segment is heavily dependent on mutual fund and annuity products offered by a relatively small number of companies, and, if these products fail to remain competitive with other investment options or we lose our relationship with one or more of these companies, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe earn a significant portion of our earnings through our relationships with a small group of mutual fund and annuity companies. A decision by one or more of these companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements or product offerings with us, or a change in law or regulation that compels us to alter or discontinue such arrangements, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of our investment and savings products fail to achieve satisfactory investment performance, our clients may seek higher yielding alternative investment products, and we could experience higher redemption rates. In addition, we earn a growing portion of our earnings through our asset-based advisory platform. A mix shift of new investments to our advisory platform could materially impact cash flows to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of alternative investments such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), which we do not currently offer on our brokerage platform, but which are available indirectly to our clients on our advisory platform. These investment options typically have low fee structures and provide some of the attributes of mutual funds, such as risk diversification. If these products continue to gain traction among our client base as viable alternatives to mutual fund investments, or if other product innovations not offered by us gain traction, our investment and savings products revenues could decline.\nIn addition to sales commissions and asset-based compensation, a portion of our earnings from investment and savings products comes from recordkeeping services that we provide to mutual fund companies and from fees earned for custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts in the funds of these mutual fund companies. We also receive marketing and support fees from each of these mutual fund companies. A decision by one or more of these fund companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us, or a change in law or regulation that compels us to alter or discontinue such arrangements, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s or the securities-licensed sales representatives' violations of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations could expose us to material liabilities.\nOur subsidiary broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, PFS Investments, and the sales representatives, are subject to federal and state regulation of its securities business. These regulations cover sales practices, trade suitability, supervision of registered representatives, recordkeeping, the conduct and qualification of officers and employees, net capital requirements, business operations, the rules and regulations of the MSRB and state blue sky regulation. Investment advisory representatives are generally held to a higher standard of conduct than registered representatives. Our subsidiary, PSS, is a registered transfer agent engaged in the recordkeeping business and is subject to SEC regulation. Violations of laws or regulations applicable to the activities of PFS Investments or PSS, or violations by a third party with which PFS Investments or PSS contracts, could subject us to regulatory actions and/or litigation and could result in the imposition of cease and desist orders, fines or censures, restitution to clients, suspension or revocation of SEC registration, suspension or expulsion from FINRA, reputational damage and legal expense, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Canadian broker-dealer subsidiary, PFSL Investments Canada and the sales representatives are subject to the securities laws of the provinces and territories of Canada in which we sell our mutual fund products and to the rules of the MFDA, the self-regulatory organization governing mutual fund dealers. PFSL Investments Canada is subject to periodic review by both the MFDA and the provincial and territorial securities commissions to assess its compliance with, among other things, applicable capital requirements and sales practices and procedures. These regulators have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business for failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Possible sanctions that could be imposed include the suspension of individual sales representatives, limitations on the activities in which the dealer may engage, suspension or revocation of the dealer registration, the ability to withhold licenses or to impose restrictive terms and conditions on the licenses of sales representatives, censure or fines, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf heightened standards of conduct or more stringent licensing requirements, such as those adopted by the SEC and those proposed or adopted by state legislatures or regulators or Canadian securities regulators, are imposed on us or the sales representatives, or selling compensation is reduced as a result of new legislation or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. sales representatives are subject to federal and state regulation as well as state licensing requirements. PFS Investments, Inc., which is regulated as a broker-dealer, and U.S. sales representatives are currently subject to general anti-fraud limitations under the Exchange Act and SEC rules and regulations, as well as other conduct standards prescribed by the FINRA. These standards generally require that broker-dealers and their sales representatives disclose conflicts of interest that might affect the advice or recommendations they provide and require them to make suitable investment recommendations to their customers. On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted rules and interpretations addressing the standards of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers and their associated persons (collectively, the \u201cSEC Rulemaking\u201d). Specifically, the SEC Rulemaking (i) creates a new \u201cbest interest\u201d standard of conduct for broker-dealers (\u201cReg BI\u201d), (ii) imposes new disclosure requirements through summary forms intended to clarify relationships among brokers, advisers, and their retail customers (\u201cForm CRS\u201d), (iii) provides interpretative guidance regarding the standard of conduct that applies to investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), and (iv) provides interpretative guidance on the scope of the broker-dealer \u201csolely incidental\u201d exclusion from the definition of \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d in the Advisers Act. The SEC Rulemaking became effective on July 12, 2019, with a compliance date of June 30, 2020 for Reg BI and Form CRS. We anticipate making certain changes to our sales processes, policies, and procedures in order to comply with the SEC Rulemaking. While we acknowledge that its higher standards of care and enhanced obligations increase regulatory and litigation risk, we do not anticipate that the SEC Rulemaking will cause significant disruption to our business.\nIn addition to federal regulators, certain states have proposed or passed laws or proposed or issued regulations requiring investment advisers, broker-dealers, and/or insurance agents to meet fiduciary standards or standards of care that their advice be in the customer\u2019s best interest, and to mitigate and disclose conflicts of interest to consumers of investment and insurance products. The severity of the impact that such state laws or regulations could have on our business vary from state to state depending on the content of the legislation or regulation and how it would be applied by state regulators and interpreted by the courts, but any such laws or regulations could disrupt our brokerage business in the relevant state. We cannot quantify the financial impact, if any, of any changes to our business that may be necessary in order to comply with such laws or regulations at this time.\nOn February 20, 2020, the organization of provincial and territorial securities regulators (collectively referred to as the \u201cCanadian Securities Administrators\u201d or \u201cCSA\u201d) published final rule amendments, applicable in all provinces except Ontario, to prohibit upfront sales commissions by fund companies for the sale of mutual funds offered under a prospectus in Canada (\u201cDSC Ban\u201d). The final amendments have an effective date of June 1, 2022. The CSA indicated that the participating provinces\u2019 prohibition of upfront sales commissions by fund companies will require firms to discontinue the use of the mutual fund deferred sales charge compensation model, which is the primary model for the mutual funds we distribute in Canada. These rules will result in changes in compensation arrangements with both the fund companies that offer the mutual fund products we distribute and sales representatives in the participating provinces. The deferred sales charge compensation model is permitted to be used until the effective date. While Ontario has disagreed with the prohibition of upfront sales commissions by fund companies and is not at this time participating in adoption of the DSC Ban, the Ontario Securities Commission has proposed several restrictions on the use of the deferred compensation model, including a $50,000 maximum account size and a limitation on the maximum term of the deferred sales charge schedule to three years compared to current industry practice where the maximum term can be up to seven years. These restrictions, if any, will also be effective June 1, 2022. We have not finished the process of determining the types of changes we will make in response to the DSC Ban and the restrictions in Ontario, therefore, we are unable to quantify the potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn Canada, on October 3, 2019, the CSA published final rule amendments intended to better align the interest of securities dealers and representatives with the interests of their clients, improve outcomes for clients, and make clearer to clients the nature and terms of their relationship with registered firms and their representatives. Collectively these amendments are referred to as the Client Focused Reforms (\u201cCFRs\u201d). The CFRs, among other things, require registered firms to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest between registered firms and their representatives, on one hand, and clients, on the other, such that recommendations may be made in clients\u2019 best interest. The CFRs are subject to ministerial approval and have staggered implementation dates. The implementation date to address conflicts and to improve disclosure is December 31, 2020 and the implementation date to enhance overall suitability rules, know your client rules, and know your product requirements is December 31, 2021. CFRs will require changes to our sales process and back-office systems and processes and may necessitate changes in compensation arrangements with the fund companies that offer the mutual fund products we distribute in Canada. Although not expected at this time, the impact of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our investment and savings products business in Canada.\nHeightened standards of conduct or restrictions on compensation as a result of any of the above items or other similar proposed rules or regulations could also increase the compliance and regulatory burdens on the sales representatives and could lead to increased litigation and regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of licensed representatives and a reduction in the products we offer to our clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our suitability policies and procedures, or our policies and procedures for compliance with federal or state regulations governing standards of care, were deemed inadequate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe review the account applications that we receive for our investment and savings products for suitability and for compliance with other federal or state regulations governing standards of care. While we believe that the policies and procedures we implement to help sales representatives assist clients in making appropriate and suitable investment choices, and that will satisfy other federal and state standards of care, are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, it is possible that the SEC, FINRA, the DOL, the IRS, state securities and insurance regulators or MFDA may not agree. Further, we could be subject to regulatory actions or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales force support tools may fail to appropriately identify financial needs or suitable investment products.\nThe support tools we make available to the sales force are designed to educate potential and existing clients, help identify their financial needs, generally introduce the potential benefits of our product offerings, and identify suitable investment products. The tools themselves or the assumptions and methods of analyses embedded in them could be challenged and subject us to regulatory action by the SEC, the DOL, FINRA or other regulators, or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with applicable regulations could lead to revocation of our subsidiary's status as a non-bank custodian.\nPFS Investments is a non-bank custodian of retirement accounts, as permitted under Treasury Regulation 1.408-2. A non-bank custodian is an entity that is not a bank and that is permitted by the IRS to act as a custodian for retirement plan account assets of our clients. The IRS retains authority to revoke or suspend that status if it finds that PFS Investments is unwilling or unable to administer retirement accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the applicable regulations. Revocation of PFS Investments' non-bank custodian status would affect its ability to earn revenue for providing such services and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our securities sales increase, we become more sensitive to performance of the equity markets.\nA significant portion of our investment sales and assets under management are comprised of North American equity-based products. The multi-year growth in equity valuations has increased proportionally the Company\u2019s revenue and product income derived from the sale of these products. A significant correction in the North American equity markets that decreases the Company\u2019s assets under management, or a protracted long-term downturn in equity market performance that has a negative effect on the Company\u2019s sales of securities products, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nIf one of our significant information technology systems fails, if its security is compromised, or if the Internet becomes disabled or unavailable, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information technology systems and third-party technology systems, networks and clouds to record, process, transmit and store information, including sensitive customer and proprietary information. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions including to conduct many of our business activities and transactions with customers, sales representatives, vendors and other third parties, to prepare our financial statements and to communicate with our Board of Directors. Our information technology systems and applications run a variety of third-party and proprietary software, including POL (our secure intranet website designed to be a support system for the sales force), the Primerica App, our insurance administration system, Virtual Base Shop (our secure intranet-based paperless field office management system), TurboApps (our point-of-sale tool that streamlines our application processes), our FNA tool, our licensing decision and support system, and our compensation system. Our business also relies on the use by employees, representatives and other third parties of electronic mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft.\nMaintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of sales representatives and customers, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our customers\u2019 confidential and personal information. We could experience a failure of one or more of these systems or could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing new software systems. In addition, despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions.\nWe are subject to international, federal and state regulations, and in some cases contractual obligations, that require us to establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to protect sensitive customer, employee, sales representative and third-party information. We have implemented and maintain security measures, including industry-standard commercial technology, designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks resulting from attacks by third parties, including hackers, and from employee or representative error or malfeasance. We continually assess our ability to monitor, respond to, and recover from such threats. We also require third-party vendors, who in the provision of services to us are provided with or process information pertaining to our business or our customers, to meet certain information security standards. Despite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity and technology risks, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such breaches or interference by third parties or by sales representatives or employees that may occur in the future including the failure of any one of these systems for any reason, could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information technology systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally-identifiable client information and proprietary business information. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions require that regulators and clients be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally-identifiable client information, which could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.\nOperating system failures, ineffective system implementation, loss of the Internet or the compromise of security with respect to internal, external or third-party operating systems or electronic devices could subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, harm our reputation, interrupt our business operations, deter people from purchasing our products, require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses, and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe current legislative and regulatory climate with regard to cybersecurity may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nVarious international, federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering or have considered, proposed, or adopted new standards and rules regarding protection of personally-identifiable information. The NYDFS Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies require covered financial services institutions to implement a cybersecurity program designed to protect information systems. The NAIC has adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (\u201cModel Law\u201d), which, among other things, would require insurers and insurance producers to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, and assess the data security practices of third-party service providers. The Model Law, which has some similarities as well as differences from the NYDFS\u2019s cybersecurity regulation, has been adopted by several states. In June 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) designed to give consumers more control over their personal data. The CCPA, which imposes strict liability for security incidents under certain circumstances, will become effective in January 2020. All 50 U.S. states and Canada have breach notification requirements.\nSuch laws or regulations could require us to implement new technologies or revise and maintain policies and procedures designed to protect sensitive customer, employee, representative and third-party information. Being subject to, or out of compliance with, the aforementioned laws and regulations could result in material costs, fines, penalties or litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event of a disaster, our business continuity plan may not be sufficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur infrastructure supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions for business resumption in the event of a disaster, including a security incident. In the event of either a campus-wide destruction or the inability to access our data center or main campus in Duluth, Georgia, our business recovery plan provides for a limited number of our employees to perform their work functions via a dedicated business backup/recovery site located around 20 miles from our main campus or by remote access from an employee's home. However, in the event of campus-wide destruction, our business recovery plan may be inadequate, and our employees and the sales representatives may be unable to carry out their work, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLicensing requirements will impact the size of the mortgage loan sales force.\nTo offer mortgage loan products, sales representatives must be individually licensed as mortgage loan originators by the states in which they do business and, in some states, they must also be individually licensed as mortgage brokers. These licensing requirements include enrollment in the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, application to state regulators for individual licenses, a minimum of 20 hours of pre-licensing education, an annual minimum of eight hours of continuing education, and the successful completion of both national and state tests or a national test with uniform state content. Compliance with these licensing regimes (including background and credit checks) have proven to be a barrier for many sales representatives. In addition, the tests have historically been challenging for the sales representatives to pass. Primerica Mortgage, LLC must also be licensed at the company level as a Mortgage Broker (or equivalent) and, in almost all states, representatives\u2019 offices must be licensed as branch offices. To offer mortgage loans in a state, individual representatives, offices and Primerica Mortgage, LLC must be licensed as required by state law. These licenses must be renewed on an annual basis. Failure of sales representatives to obtain the required licenses and comply with ongoing licensing requirements would adversely affect the size of the mortgage loan sales force, which could materially adversely affect our mortgage loan business.\nOur loan business is subject to various federal and state laws, changes in which could affect the cost or our ability to distribute our products and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.S. mortgage loan business is subject to various federal laws, including the Truth In Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation B, the Fair Housing Act and the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act. We are also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation X, which requires timely disclosures related to the nature and costs of real estate settlement amounts and limits those costs and compensation to amounts reasonably related to the services performed.\nWe are also subject to the Dodd-Frank Act and are regulated by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which has the authority to examine, supervise and enforce federal consumer financial laws, including those impacting Primerica Mortgage, LLC\u2019s business. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes restrictions on the manner and amount of mortgage originator compensation and establishes a federal ability to repay standard for all mortgage loans. Other restrictions contained in the Dodd-Frank Act could have the effect of limiting the availability of certain loan products in the market and adversely impact the range of products offered and the volume of loan business.\nAdditionally, we must comply with various state and local laws and policies concerning our lenders, the provision of consumer disclosures, net branching, predatory lending and high cost loans and recordkeeping. Differing interpretations of, changes in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations could subject us to damages, fines or sanctions and could affect the cost or our ability to distribute our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit deterioration in, and the effects of interest rate fluctuations on, our invested asset portfolio and other assets that are subject to changes in credit quality and interest rates could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA large percentage of our invested asset portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities. As a result, credit deterioration and interest rate fluctuations could materially affect the value of and earnings generated by our invested asset portfolio. Fixed-income securities decline in value if there is no active trading market for the securities or the market's impression of, or the ratings agencies' views on, the credit quality of an issuer worsens. During periods of declining market interest rates, we must invest the cash we receive as interest, return of principal on our investments and cash from operations in lower-yielding, high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities could also decide to prepay their obligations to borrow at lower market rates, which would increase our reinvestment risk. If interest rates generally increase, the fair value of our fixed rate income portfolio decreases. Additionally, if the fair value of any security in our invested asset portfolio decreases, we may realize losses if we deem the value of the security to be other-than-temporarily impaired. We also have an asset on deposit with a coinsurer backing a 10% coinsurance agreement entered into at the time of our IPO. The fair value of this asset is influenced by fluctuation in credit spreads and interest rates, and changes in fair value are recognized in income. To the extent that any fluctuations in fair value or interest rates are significant or we recognize impairments that are material, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2022, financial markets will transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a reference interest rate for securities and contract terms. The discontinuation of LIBOR or a switch to an alternative reference rate could adversely impact the value and liquidity of certain investments that use LIBOR as a reference rate and could cause increased cost or uncertainties regarding changes required to be made to contracts that reference LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, investments that are tied to LIBOR represent less than 5% of our invested asset portfolio. We also have limited number of other contracts that reference LIBOR, including our Credit Facility Agreement and captive reinsurance agreements, but we do not anticipate the transition to an alternative reference rate will have meaningful impact on such agreements.\nValuation of our investments and the determination of what type of impairment exists when the fair value of our available-for-sale invested assets is below amortized cost are both based on estimates that may prove to be incorrect.\nOur portfolio of invested assets primarily consists of fixed-maturity securities that are classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of any of our available-for-sale invested assets declines below amortized cost, an impairment exists and we recognize a loss in either our statement of income or in other comprehensive income based on the type of the impairment. The determination of the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates. Once it is determined that the fair value of an available-for-sale security is below its carrying value, we must determine what type of impairment exists, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates.\nThere are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining the type of impairment that exists when the fair value of available-for-sale securities declines below amortized cost. These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions. In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets. To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination of what type of impairment exists for available-for-sale securities, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.\nChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and could adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. U.S. GAAP is a continuously evolving set of financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Changes to U.S. GAAP can be difficult to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. An upcoming change in U.S. GAAP that will impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations is Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-12, Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944) - Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (\"ASU 2018-12\"). The amendments in this update will change the accounting guidance we follow for long-duration insurance contracts. The most notable amendment included in ASU 2018-12 will require us to update assumptions used in measuring future policy benefits, including mortality, persistency, and disability rates, at least annually instead of locking those assumptions at contract inception and reflecting differences in assumptions and actual performance as the experience occurs. ASU 2018-12 also includes changes to how we amortize DAC and determine and update the discount rate assumptions used in measuring future policy benefits reserves while increasing the level of financial statement disclosures required. The amendments in ASU 2018-12 are scheduled to be effective for the Company beginning in 2022 as of the earliest period presented\nin the consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2018-12 will have a pervasive impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and will require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. This new accounting standard, in addition to other financial reporting standard changes being discussed by the FASB and the SEC, could adversely impact both our financial condition and results of operations as reported on a U.S. GAAP basis.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting principles designated by regulators in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. The financial statements of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with SAPs prescribed or permitted by state insurance departments and the NAIC. SAPs, including actuarial methodologies for estimating reserves, are subject to continuous evaluation by the NAIC and state insurance departments. Similarly, our Canadian life insurance subsidiary is required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with IFRS, as prescribed by the OSFI in Canada. In 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cIASB\u201d) issued an IFRS standard that will significantly overhaul our Canadian life insurance subsidiary\u2019s accounting for insurance contracts (\u201cIFRS 17\u201d) for statutory reporting purposes. The IASB has engaged in the process of issuing targeted amendments to IFRS 17 in response to concerns and implementation challenges raised by stakeholders and the proposed effective date of 2022 could be impacted by such amendments. The statutory financial statements of our insurance company subsidiaries, which are used to determine dividend capacity and risk-based capital, could be adversely affected by these and other future changes implemented by jurisdictional insurance departments. Therefore, the ability of our insurance companies to comply with regulatory minimum capital requirements and ultimately pay dividends to the Parent Company could be adversely impacted.\nThe effects of economic down cycles could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by economic downturns in the United States and Canada, as well as issues in the global economy that may have repercussions on our local markets. Economic downturns, which are often characterized by higher unemployment, lower household income, lower valuation of retirement savings accounts, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, have adversely affected the demand for the term life insurance, investment and savings and other financial products that we sell. Future economic down cycles could adversely affect new sales and cause clients to liquidate mutual funds and other investments sold by sales representatives. This could cause a decrease in the asset value of client accounts, reduce our trailing commission revenues and result in a decline in the fair value of our invested asset portfolio. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders of insurance policies, and some of our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Further, volatility in equity markets or downturns could discourage purchases of the investment products that we distribute and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, including our ability to recruit and retain sales representatives.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and provincial laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, changes in which or violations of which may require us to alter our business practices and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, we are subject to many regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, including Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the FTC Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and the Interlink Network Inc. Operating Regulations. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, which requires us to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity and maintain certain records. Further, we are required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals.\nIn Canada, we are subject to provincial and territorial regulations, including consumer protection legislation that pertains to unfair and misleading business practices, provincial and territorial credit reporting legislation that provides requirements in respect of obtaining credit bureau reports and providing notices of decline, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Competition Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the Telecommunications Act and certain Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Telecom Decisions in respect of unsolicited telecommunications. We are also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and its accompanying regulations, which require us to develop and implement anti-money laundering policies and procedures relating to customer indemnification, reporting and recordkeeping, develop and maintain ongoing training programs for employees, perform a risk assessment on our business and clients and institute and document a third-party independent review of our anti-money laundering program at least once every two years. We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions and legislation that prohibit us from, among other things, engaging in transactions with, and providing services to, persons on lists created under various federal statutes and regulations and blocked persons and foreign countries and territories subject to Canadian sanctions administered by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada and the Department of Public Safety Canada.\nChanges in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations and actions may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face a risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses. From time to time, we are subject to private litigation as a result of alleged sales representative misconduct or alleged failure of the Company to follow applicable insurance, securities or other laws or regulations. For example, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, product design and disclosure, delay of benefits, and product pricing. In addition, we are subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities. For example, we have a large sales force and we could face claims by current or former sales representatives arising out of their relationship with us as independent contractors or regarding compensation-related issues. If we become subject to any such litigation, the associated legal expense and any judgment or settlement of the claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are undergoing multi-state treasurer unclaimed property audits by 30 jurisdictions currently focused on the life insurance claims paying practices of our subsidiaries, Primerica Life and NBLIC. Other jurisdictions may pursue similar audits and litigation. The potential outcome of such actions is difficult to predict but could subject us to adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, settlement payments, additional payments to beneficiaries, and additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws. We cannot reasonably estimate the likelihood or the impact of additional costs or liabilities that could result from resolution of these matters, or the effect these matters may have on the conduct of our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also routinely subject to regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state, provincial and federal regulators and other authorities and from time to time, regulatory investigations as a result of alleged sales representative misconduct or alleged failure of the Company to follow applicable laws or regulations. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, even if we ultimately prevail in any litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and we could incur significant legal expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current legislative and regulatory climate with regard to financial services may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe volume of legislative and regulatory activity relating to financial services has increased substantially in recent years, and the level of enforcement actions and investigations by federal, state and provincial regulators may increase correspondingly. Legislative, regulatory and enforcement activity at the federal level may contribute to heightened activity at the state and provincial level. If we or the sales representatives become subject to new requirements or regulations, it could result in increased litigation, regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of securities-licensed representatives or a reduction in the products we offer to our clients or the profits we earn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulators could adopt laws or interpret existing laws in a way that would require retroactive changes to our business, accounting practices, or redundant reserve financing structures. Any such retroactive changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us in sufficient amounts would impede our ability to meet our obligations and return capital to our stockholders.\nOperations of the Company are conducted by its subsidiaries. As such, Primerica, Inc. is a holding company that has no significant operations. Our primary asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our primary liability is our Senior Notes. We rely primarily on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet our operating costs, other corporate expenses, Senior Note obligations, as well as to return capital to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us depends on their earnings, covenants contained in existing and future financing or other agreements and on regulatory restrictions. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends will further depend on their statutory income and surplus. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payments and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations or if a subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets. However, given the historic volatility in the capital markets, there is no assurance that we would be able to raise cash by these means.\nThe jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us. In the United States, these restrictions are based, in part, on the prior year's statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. In Canada, dividends can be paid, subject to the paying insurance company continuing to meet the regulatory requirements for capital adequacy and liquidity and upon 15 days' minimum notice to OSFI. No assurance is given that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, and such restrictions could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, in the future, we may become subject to debt covenants or other agreements that limit our ability to return capital to our stockholders. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by our need to maintain the financial strength ratings assigned to us by the ratings agencies.\nIf any of our subsidiaries were to become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary. Furthermore, with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under the applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws, although, in Canada, we could apply for permission to cause liquidation. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors of the subsidiary and policyholders (if an insurance subsidiary) would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary's assets before we, as the sole stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary.\nIf the ability of our insurance or non-insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, bankruptcy or insolvency, or our need to maintain our financial strength ratings, or is limited due to operating results or other factors, it could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our obligations and return capital to our stockholders.\nA significant change in the competitive environment in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.\nWe face competition in all of our business lines. Our competitors include financial services companies, banks, investment management firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, insurance brokers, direct sales companies, and technology companies. In many of our product offerings, we face competition from competitors that may have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations, have lower fee and expense ratios, have higher financial strength ratings or offer more robust digital tools and self-service capabilities than we do. More recently, significant capital has been invested in direct-to-consumer offerings, including wealth management, retirement and life insurance products. In addition, regulatory changes and competitive factors are leading to innovations in product offerings and compensation structures. To the extent these entrants create a significant change in the competitive environment, our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of key employees and sales force leaders could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team. The efforts, personality and leadership of our senior management team have been, and will continue to be, critical to our success. The loss of service of our senior management team due to disability, death, retirement or some other cause could reduce our ability to successfully motivate the sales representatives, or implement our business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although our senior executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us, there is no assurance that they will complete the term of their employment agreements or that they or the Company will renew them upon expiration.\nIn addition, the loss of key RVPs for any reason could negatively affect our financial results, impair our ability to attract new sales representatives and hinder future growth.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the United States dollar versus the Canadian dollar.\nThe Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian subsidiaries and our financial results, reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. The assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of our Canadian subsidiaries are generally all denominated in Canadian dollars. However, the Canadian dollar financial statements of our Canadian subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, significant exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would result in lower levels of reported revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income as translated in our U.S. dollar reporting currency financial statements. In addition, our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries is significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for companies in the financial services industry in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Also, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Our stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that include the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies, and general market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;\n\u2022\nlow trading volume and short interest positions in our common stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges, or the expectation of changes in federal and state law, policy and regulation, or changes in the ways that laws and regulations are interpreted and applied;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, regulatory reviews and investigations, and any adverse publicity related thereto;\n\u2022\nactions by the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), or uncertainty related to possible actions by the NYSE, related to the continued listing of our common stock;\n\u2022\nnegative media reports with respect to us and/or our industry;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or geopolitical conditions; and\n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.", "PERMNO": 93330, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "PRI"}
