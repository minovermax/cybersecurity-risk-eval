We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Any factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nFollowing the PLM Sale, we will be substantially dependent on our HomeView business.\nImmediately following the PLM Sale, our operations will be composed of SofTech Srl, a value added reseller and systems integration business, and our HomeView business. SofTech Srl has recorded operating losses for two consecutive fiscal years and is dependent on distribution agreements for much of its revenue. HomeView has been in the marketplace for less than one year and is not yet producing revenue. Our HomeView related cash expenditures over the last two fiscal years totaled approximately $1.5 million. While our analysis of the HomeView marketplace and our interaction with potential partners support the need for this kind of technology in the residential property market, there can be no assurance that HomeView will gain the number of users required to warrant continued investment in the technology. Failure to gain market acceptance may lead to write offs of the investment made in HomeView through a charge to income.\nWe will need additional capital to continue to develop and launch our HomeView\u2122 technology and product.\nWe generated positive cash flow as measured by EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) plus non-cash expenses, taxes and interest expense), a non-GAAP measure, every fiscal year from 2002 through 2014. The sale of the CADRA product line in fiscal 2014 together with the investment made in 2015 and 2016 to develop a new product for the residential property market has resulted in cash losses in those two fiscal years that have been funded by our balance sheet, sales of common stock and limited additional borrowings. We will require additional capital to support the ongoing development and launch of our HomeView technology and product. There can be no assurance that the capital needed will be available or if the terms will be reasonable. If the Company is unable to raise the necessary capital, its plans for maximizing the return on the capital invested in the new product and for establishing a new revenue source may be materially negatively impacted.\nFollowing the sale of the CADRA business in October 2013 and our pending PLM Sale, we have been and will continue to restructure and refocus our business to enable us to successfully operate as a significantly smaller company and to seek new sources of revenue and new strategic initiatives. Our operating results subsequent to the sale of the PLM business may not be profitable, and we may be unsuccessful in expanding our eCommerce business or developing other new business opportunities.\nThe PLM business was responsible for about 83% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2016 and contributed positively in reducing our losses from HomeView and SofTech, Srl. The importance of the PLM business to the consolidated results in fiscal 2016 was similar in at least the two immediately preceding fiscal years. Our HomeView technology has not generated any revenue. The Company will likely need to raise additional capital in the coming years to continue to pursue the adoption and growth in the HomeView technology.\nWe have substantial repurchase obligations relating to securities we sold in various private placements, which may be put to us starting in September 2016. If we are unable to meet these financial obligations, which are approximately $1,260,000 in the aggregate, or re-negotiate their terms, our financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nPursuant to the terms of prior private placements, we have outstanding 180,000 shares of our common stock that were sold at a purchase price of $5.00 per share and each investor may, beginning on various dates in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, require us to repurchase such investor\u2019s shares at $7.00 per share, as indicated below:\nRepurchase Period\nNo. of Shares Subject to Repurchase\nPurchase Price\n(per share)\nRepurchase Price\n(per share)\nAggregate Repurchase Price\n9/18/16 - 10/18/16\n20,000\n$5.00\n$7.00\n$140,000\n9/22/16 - 10/22/16\n30,000\n$5.00\n$7.00\n$210,000\n10/9/16 - 11/8/16\n10,000\n$5.00\n$7.00\n$70,000\n6/20/17 - 9/18/17\n110,000\n$5.00\n$7.00\n$770,000\n9/21/17 - 10/21/17\n10,000\n$5.00\n$7.00\n$70,000\nTotal:\n180,000\n$1,260,000\nIf we are unable to honor the put right with respect to 110,000 of such shares (a financial obligation of $770,000), the unpaid portion converts into a loan obligation secured by all our assets and bearing interest at an annual rate of 20%. If we default on our obligations under such note, the holder of such note may assert any rights it has as a secured creditor, including rights to foreclose on our assets. The Asset Purchase Agreement we signed on August 23, 2016 to sell the ProductCenter and Connector technologies contemplates repurchasing these 110,000 shares at a discount of approximately $6.50 per share.\nRevenue declines in our product lines may have a material adverse impact upon our business and overall financial performance.\nRevenue from our ProductCenter technology declined for eight straight fiscal years from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2014 before increasing by 14.7% in fiscal 2015. In fiscal year 2016, ProductCenter revenue remained constant compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue declines from fiscal 2006 through 2014 described above were due to several factors. In July 2007, PTC informed us that it would not renew its partnership agreement with us when the agreement expired in January 2008. We had been a member of the PTC partnership program for 12 years. The PTC partnership agreement, among other things, provided us with the right to distribute certain information that allowed for our technology to directly interface with PTC\u2019s proprietary CAD tools. The non-renewal has essentially prevented us from marketing our ProductCenter solution to new customers that utilize PTC\u2019s technology and has negatively impacted our product revenue from this technology offering. In addition to the PTC partnership termination, ProductCenter revenues have been negatively affected by: (i) an increased number of competitive offerings in the marketplace, (ii) elongation of purchase decisions by customers of a technology that already has a long sales cycle, and (iii) uncertain economic conditions. The improved revenue over the last two fiscal years was due to expansion in the use of this technology at several long time customers, increased maintenance renewal rates and increased consulting services related to the expansions.\nSubscription revenue from our Connector technology increased by 41.6% from fiscal 2015 to 2016. We added eight (8) new customers and we hope to continue to build on that momentum. This solution is offered only as a subscription which makes revenue growth a more likely event year-over-year as compared to the perpetual license model employed with our ProductCenter technology. The customers for our Connector technology are Aras Innovator (a third party PLM solution) users that have already made the investment in that technology and are now trying to get more functionality from that investment. It is our understanding that Aras Innovator continues to grow at a much faster rate than the overall PLM market which provides us with an opportunity to continue to grow our Connector revenue.\nWhile the recent revenue trend for ProductCenter is encouraging and the market acceptance for our Connector technology is building, we do not have enough broad based momentum from either technology to yet be able to definitively conclude that the historical revenue declines we experienced from 2006 to 2014 are behind us.\nSignificant future declines in our total revenues may have a material adverse impact upon our business and overall financial performance.\nWe compete against numerous technology companies in the mature PLM industry that are significantly larger and have vastly greater financial resources at their disposal.\nMany of our competitors, including PTC, SolidWorks, Siemens and Autodesk, have substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do and represent significant competition for us. Our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or products which may gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products. Existing or proposed products of our competitors may render our existing or proposed products noncompetitive or obsolete. If we are unable to compete successfully in the future, the competitive pressures that we face could adversely affect our profitability or financial performance.\nOur agreements with certain software vendors may be terminated at will by the vendors.\nWe utilize third party vendors to provide certain software and utilities which help us to continue to develop and support ProductCenter customers with their integrations from ProductCenter to their respective CAD solutions. These agreements are subject to termination at will by the vendors, and, if terminated, we would need to seek alternative methods of providing continuing support to our existing customers and an alternative solution to meet the needs of prospective customers, which could have a material adverse effect on future performance. For example, in July 2007, we were informed that our agreement with one such vendor, PTC, was not going to be extended beyond its renewal date of January 31, 2008. Thus the agreement with PTC has since expired. A significant number of our current ProductCenter customers utilize PTC\u2019s proprietary CAD technology. We continue to support our current customers who are utilizing PTC\u2019s CAD solution with a customer specific consulting solution. While this customer specific consulting solution has allowed us to retain the majority of our customers utilizing PTC\u2019s CAD tool, it has precluded us from proposing our solution to new customers using that CAD technology. Our inability to offer our solution to new customers utilizing PTC\u2019s technology or similar restrictions that could result from any future terminations of similar agreements with other vendors could have an adverse effect on our future revenues.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to reduce taxable income generated in the future could be substantially limited or eliminated.\nAs of May 31, 2016, we had approximately $22 million of federal NOLs available to offset future taxable income, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022, if unused. We may not generate taxable income in time to use these NOLs prior to their expiration, and the Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the amount or timing of prior losses, thereby limiting the value of our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to use our NOLs is subject to an annual limitation due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as determined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state regulations. Depending on the actual amount of any limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, our future taxable income could be subject to federal and/or state income tax, creating federal and/or state income tax liabilities. We previously maintained a tax benefits preservation plan with respect to our NOLs, which expired in February 2015.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly for several reasons including: the timing and success of introductions of any new products or product enhancements or those of our competitors; uncertainty created by changes in the market; variations in the size and timing of individual orders; competition and pricing; seasonality; and customer order deferrals or cancellations as a result of general economic conditions or industry decline. Furthermore, we have often recognized a substantial portion of our product revenues in the last month of a quarter, with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter. As a result, product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter and revenues from any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy. We typically do not experience order backlog. For these reasons, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nOur financial condition could be adversely affected if significant errors or defects are found in our software.\nSophisticated software can sometimes contain errors, defects or other performance problems. If errors or defects are discovered in our current or future products, we may need to expend significant financial, technical and management resources, or divert some of our development resources, in order to resolve or work around those defects, and we may not be able to correct them in a timely manner or provide an adequate response to our customers.\nErrors, defects or other performance problems in our products could cause us to delay new product releases or customer deployments. Any such delays could negatively impact our ability to realize revenue from the licensing and shipment of new or enhanced products and give our competitors a greater opportunity to market competing products. Such difficulties could also cause us to lose customers. Technical problems or the loss of customers could also damage our business reputation and cause us to lose new business opportunities.\nWe are dependent on key personnel whose loss could impair our operations, our product development or our sales efforts.\nWe are a small company especially for one that is publicly held. Our technologies are complex and have been developed over many years. While we enjoy the benefit of a very experienced, long-tenured employee group, we are dependent on many of those employees for the familiarity, expertise and unique insight they have developed with our products that would be extremely difficult and time consuming to replace. The loss of services of any of our key personnel could make it difficult for us to meet important objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals.\nWe may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur ProductCenter technology was launched in the early 1990\u2019s. Over the decades that our technologies have been in the marketplace, a significant number of patents have been filed by competitors. It is difficult if not impossible for us to monitor these patent awards to become familiar with their claims and we do not attempt to do so. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on the patent or proprietary rights of others. Parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products, and such claims could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products or be required to cease offering affected products and our operating results would be harmed.\nOur sales and operations are globally dispersed, which exposes us to additional operating and compliance risks.\nWe sell and deliver software and services, and maintain support operations in multiple countries whose laws and practices differ from one another. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, North America accounted for approximately 78% and 81%, Europe for approximately 22% and 19% and Asia for approximately zero percent of our revenue. Managing these geographically dispersed operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance with laws. Accordingly, while we maintain a compliance program, we cannot guarantee that an employee, agent or business partner will not act in violation of our policies or U.S. or other applicable laws. Such violations can lead to civil and/or criminal prosecutions, substantial fines and the revocation of our rights to continue certain operations and also cause business and reputation loss.\nWe are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn December 2011, we filed a Form 8-A with the SEC in connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement (333-174818), subjecting us again to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. As a public company, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We may not be able to remediate future material weaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nBecause we are a relatively small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management; and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we need to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations of the SEC. If we list our securities on an exchange, the exchange will impose additional requirements on listed companies, including enhanced corporate governance practices. For example, the NASDAQ listing requirements require that listed companies satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors, audit committees, distribution of annual and interim reports, shareholder meetings, shareholder approvals, solicitation of proxies, conflicts of interest, shareholder voting rights and codes of business conduct. Complying with the SEC statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and could increase our costs and expenses.\nFrom time to time we may make acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we have in the past and may make acquisitions in the future. We may also make significant investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWeakness in the United States and international economies may continue to adversely affect our business.\nThe past few years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions. Because we market, sell and license our products throughout the world, in addition to the ongoing adverse effects on our business of continued weakness in the U.S. economy, we could be significantly affected by continuing weak economic conditions in foreign and domestic markets that could reduce demand for our products.\nRisks Related to the Market for our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nSince the Recapitalization Transaction, the closing stock price has ranged from a low price of $1.00 per share to a high price of $4.95 per share. A contributing factor to the price fluctuation is the low average daily volume, which over the last three fiscal years has averaged fewer than 1,000 shares per day. Given the lack of market makers in the stock and the low demand, a shareholder\u2019s attempt to sell a large number of shares relative to the average daily volume in a short period of time will likely have a material negative impact on the share price.\nOur common stock may be considered \u201cpenny stock\u201d, further reducing its liquidity.\nOur common stock may be considered \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which will further reduce the liquidity of our common stock. Trading in penny stocks is limited because broker-dealers are required to provide their customers with disclosure documents prior to allowing them to participate in transactions involving the common stock. These disclosure requirements are burdensome to broker-dealers and may discourage them from allowing their customers to participate in transactions involving our common stock, thereby further reducing the liquidity of our common stock.\nPenny stocks are equity securities with a market price below $5.00 per share other than a security (i) that is registered on a national exchange or included for quotation on the NASDAQ system, (ii) whose issuer has net tangible assets of more than $2,000,000 if it has been in continuous operation for greater than three years, or net tangible assets of more than $5,000,000 if it has been in continuous operation for less than three years or (iii) whose issuer has average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three fiscal years.\nRules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act require broker-dealers engaging in transactions in penny stocks, to first provide to their customers a series of disclosures and documents including:\n\u00b7\na standardized risk disclosure document identifying the risks inherent in investment in penny stocks;\n\u00b7\nall compensation received by the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction;\n\u00b7\ncurrent quotation prices and other relevant market data; and\n\u00b7\na monthly account statement reflecting the fair market value of the securities.\nThese rules also require that a broker-dealer obtain financial and other information from a customer, determine that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for such customer and deliver a written statement to such customer setting forth the basis for this determination.\nA small number of shareholders own a large number of shares thereby potentially exerting significant influence over us.\nAs of August 24, 2016, the three members of our board of directors beneficially owned approximately 35.7% of our outstanding shares and two other shareholders together beneficially own approximately 33.5% of outstanding shares. This concentration of ownership could significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval and could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other business combinations that might otherwise be beneficial to our other shareholders. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock. In addition, the interest of our significant shareholders may not always coincide with the interest of the Company\u2019s other shareholders. In deciding how to vote on such matters, they may be influenced by interests that conflict with our other shareholders.\nOur stock is thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all.\nThe shares of our common stock are traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. Shares of our common stock are thinly traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stockbrokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even in the event that we come to the attention of such persons, they would likely be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value of the business. Also, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. A broader or more active public trading market for our common shares may not develop or if developed, may not be sustained. Due to these conditions, you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock.\nWe do not presently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Cash dividend payments in the future may only be made out of legally available funds and, if we experience substantial losses, such funds may not be available. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. Smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. We have taken advantage of some of these reduced disclosure obligations, and thus the information we provide shareholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.\nRisks Related to the CADRA Sale\nA portion of the purchase price was deferred and we may not receive those payments.\nUp to $750,000 of the total purchase price from the CADRA Sale is based on the revenues generated by the CADRA business during the three-year period following the asset sale. Specifically, the Company will be paid earn-out payments equal to 10% of CADRA revenue generated by Mentor up to the $750,000 maximum. Through May 31, 2016 we have received a total of $527,000 of the maximum earn-out payments for the revenue recorded by Mentor through January 31, 2016. The Company is due one additional earn-out payment based on CADRA revenues generated between February 1, 2016 and October 31, 2016 (the \u201cRemaining Earn-Out Period\u201d). Mentor has broad discretion to operate its post-closing business, and may choose to do so in a manner which may or may not result in the payment of all of the CADRA earn-out payments.\nCADRA royalty payments were recorded at the transaction date based on fair value of the expected royalty payments as described in the financial statements. As of May 31, 2016, the Company estimated the fair value of the one remaining future payment at $130,000 which is subject to adjustment each fiscal quarter based on an independent third party valuation. There can be no assurance that the Company will receive all of the royalty payments it has recorded on its balance sheet as of May 31, 2016. If the actual CADRA revenue results are lower than the forecasted results the Company may have to adjust the royalty asset through a charge to earnings.\nMentor did not assume any of the excluded liabilities under the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, Mentor did not assume all of the liabilities associated with the CADRA business. Certain liabilities remained with the Company post-closing. For example, Mentor only assumed customer support obligations related to certain assigned contracts and obligations for performance under contracts that arise after the closing, and did not assume liability for any obligation or breach by the Company that occurred or arose prior to the closing. While the Company believes that it has adequately accrued for these liabilities or is adequately insured against certain of the risks associated with such excluded liabilities, there can be no assurances that additional expenditures will not be incurred in resolving these liabilities.", "PERMNO": 71002, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SOFT"}
