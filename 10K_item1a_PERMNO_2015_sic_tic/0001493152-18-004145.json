{"cik": "730349", "company": "TOFUTTI BRANDS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to maintain profitable operations in the future. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations in the future.\nWhile we returned to profitable operations in fiscal 2016 and maintained profitable operations in 2017, we incurred losses in prior years. As of December 30, 2017, we had $1,414,000 in cash and cash equivalents and our working capital was $3,721,000. The lack of sufficient working capital could negatively impact our ability to introduce and adequately promote new products. To the extent that we incur operating losses in the future or are unable to generate free cash flows from our business, we may not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations and will be required to obtain additional financing. Such financing may not be available, or, if available, may not be on terms satisfactory to us. If adequate funds are not available to us, our business, and results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe are indebted to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to a promissory note which is secured by substantially all of our assets. Any failure to meet our obligations under the note could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 6, 2016, we received a $500,000 loan from Mr. David Mintz, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The loan bears interest at 5% per annum and may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The loan is secured by substantially all of our assets and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.01 per share. Initially due on December 31, 2017, the loan has been extended until December 31, 2019.\nIn the event we are unable to repay the loan, or if there is an event of default, without any action on the part of Mr. Mintz, the interest rate will increase to 12% per annum and the entire principal and interest balance under the loan, and all of our other obligations under the loan, will be immediately due and payable, and Mr. Mintz will be entitled to seek and institute any and all remedies available to him. Any failure to meet our obligations under the note could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a few key distributors for a significant portion of our sales.\nA significant portion of our sales are to several key distributors, which are large distribution companies with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 47% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 and 46% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Although we believe that the business associated with any of our primary distributors can be readily transferred to other distributors or directly to supermarket warehouses if necessary, no assurance can be given that a change in distributors would not be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on several key suppliers to produce our products.\nWe do not produce any of our own products. During the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we purchased approximately 41% and 36% of our finished goods, respectively, from Franklin Foods, our BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE, WHIPPED BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE, SOUR SUPREME, and BETTER THAN RICOTTA co-packer, and 17% and 25%, respectively, of our finished goods from Ice Cream Specialties, our frozen dessert novelty co-packer. In 2017, Ice Cream Specialties, the co-packer of our frozen dessert stick novelties, Tofutti Cuties, and Yours Truly Cones, stopped manufacturing our frozen dessert stick novelties and Yours Truly Cones. They also ceased manufacturing Tofutti Cuties at the end of January 2018. We have been able to secure a new co-packing facility that will be making our Tofutti Cutie sandwiches and Yours Truly Cones beginning mid-April and mid-May 2018, respectively. We are currently investigating other facilities to co-pack our frozen dessert stick novelties. Our frozen dessert pints are still being produced by Leiby\u2019s Dairy in Pennsylvania. Any continued or future disruption in supply could have a further material adverse effect on our company.\nSuccessful customer relationships are vital to our business and continued growth.\nWe must maintain strong relationships with our existing customers and build relationships with new customers in order to ensure our products are well presented to our consumers and available for purchase in major markets. The strength of our customer relationships also affects our ability to obtain pricing and competitive trade terms. Failure to maintain strong relationships with customers could negatively impact our terms of business with affected customers and reduce the availability of our products to consumers.\nWe rely on a limited number of key executives to manage our business.\nOur success is significantly dependent on the services of David Mintz (age 86), Chief Executive Officer, and Steven Kass (age 66), Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of either of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a branded goods business, our success depends on the value and relevance of our brand and products to consumers and on our ability to innovate and remain competitive.\nConsumer tastes, preferences and behaviors are constantly changing and our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes and to continue to maintain loyalty to our brand and products is vital to our business. We are dependent on creating innovative products that continue to meet the needs of our consumers. If we are unable to innovate effectively, our sales or margins could be materially adversely affected.\nThe successful introduction of innovative products and packaging on a periodic basis has become increasingly important to our ability to maintain and grow our sales. Accordingly, the future degree of market acceptance of any of our new products, and continued acceptance of our current products, which may be accompanied by significant promotional expenditures, is likely to have an important impact on our future financial results.\nOur suppliers are subject to federal, state and local government regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nVirtually all food manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As producers of food products for human consumption, our suppliers are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations mandated by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA, OSHA, the EPA and the USDA. Future regulation by various federal, state or local governmental entities or agencies could, among other things, increase our suppliers\u2019 cost of production, cause them to incur unexpected expenditures or encumber productivity, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive frozen dessert and health food markets may affect our operational performance and financial results.\nThe frozen dessert, dairy free cheese food and health food markets are highly competitive. In addition, many of our principal competitors are large, diversified companies with resources significantly greater than ours. We expect strong competition to continue, including competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert and dairy free cheese food categories in supermarkets and other retail food outlets. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our market share and ability to grow our revenue could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over competitive products.\nFrom time to time, we and our customers experience price pressure in some of our markets as a result of competitors\u2019 promotional pricing practices as well as general market conditions. Our failure to match or exceed our competitors\u2019 cost reductions through innovative products and other improvements could weaken our competitive position. Competition is based on product quality, reliability, food safety, distribution effectiveness, brand loyalty, price, effective promotional activities, the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences and the ability to provide ancillary support services. We may not be able to compete effectively with these larger, more diversified companies.\nA material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\nWe are a consumer food products company and rely on continued demand for our products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits.\nOur operating costs are subject to fluctuations which could affect our business results.\nThe principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements.\nEconomic downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally. Worsening economic conditions may result in diminished demand for our products and in decreased sales volumes. Recessionary environments adversely affect the demand for our products as a result of constraints on discretionary spending by our retail customers. In addition, this could result in longer sales cycles, slower acceptance of new products and increased competition for our products, which in turn could cause us to reduce prices for our products resulting in reduced gross margins. Any of these events would likely harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, the current economic climate, and particularly the increased difficulty in securing credit, could impact the ability of our customers to purchase our products. Certain of our retail customers who have seen significant dampening of consumer demand, could face increased financial pressures that could impact their ability to purchase our products and make payments in a timely manner. The continued high unemployment levels in the U.S. and the lingering effects of the global credit crisis, will impact the ability of our customers to purchase our products.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.\nNatural disasters, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security, terrorist acts or acts of war may cause disrupt our systems and operations. We expect that our inability to operate our facilities as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to our competitors. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results vary quarterly.\nWe have often recognized a slightly greater portion of revenues in the second and third quarter of the year. We expect to continue to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters, as a result of reduced sales of dairy free frozen desserts. In addition, sales to our major customers fluctuate widely from period to period and there is no way to accurately predict that their sales pattern from one year will be repeated in the corresponding period of the next fiscal year. Due to the foregoing factors, in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of investors. In such event, it is likely that the price of our common stock would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have no registered patents. The absence of patent protection could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely upon the confidentiality of our formulas and our know-how rather than upon patent protection. There is no assurance that such confidentiality can or will be maintained or that our know-how cannot be obtained by others or that others do not now possess similar or even more effective capabilities. The failure to maintain the confidentiality of our know-how could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with international operations.\nIn fiscal 2017, approximately 12% of our revenues were from international sales. Although we intend to expand our international operations, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. To the extent that we cannot do so in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. International operations are subject to inherent risks, including the following:\n\u25cf different and changing regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future;\n\u25cf the impact of possible recessionary environments in multiple foreign markets;\n\u25cf export restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and supporting foreign operations;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf political and economic changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we currently sell or products or may sell our products in the future; and\n\u25cf seasonal reductions in business activities.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur foreign transactions are always in U.S. dollars, and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. Therefore, our future export sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar, which could increase the local currency price of our products. Although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has not had a material effect on our business, there can be no assurance such fluctuations in the future will not materially and adversely affect our revenues from international sales and, consequently, our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProduct liability suits, if brought, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business, we become subject to product liability claims. If a product liability claim exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us, it could harm our business. We cannot assure you that such coverage will be sufficient to insure against claims which may be brought against us, or that we will be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance covering existing or new products. As a marketer of food products, we are subject to the risk of claims for product liability. We maintain general product liability and umbrella insurance coverage and generally require that our co-packers maintain product liability insurance with us as a co-insured. Similarly, most of our customers require us to name them as additional insureds as well, and in some cases we are required to sign hold harmless and indemnification agreements.\nIf our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we would need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured as a result.\nFood products occasionally contain contaminants due to inherent defects or improper storage or handling. Under adverse circumstances, food producers may be required to recall some of their products if they become adulterated or misbranded or as a result of a government-mandated recall. The scope of such a recall could result in significant costs incurred as a result of the recall, potential destruction of inventory, and lost sales. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a settlement or judgment against us. A widespread product recall could result in changes to one or more of our business processes, product shortages, a loss of customer confidence in our brand or other adverse effects on our business.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors. Our efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention, and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of resources. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to provide management\u2019s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for each fiscal year. Based on our evaluation under the frameworks described above, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 30, 2017 because of the following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting:\n\u25cf a continuing lack of sufficient resources and an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight, which may restrict our ability to gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements in a timely manner.\n\u25cf The limited size of the accounting department makes it impracticable to achieve an optimum separation of duties.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities, and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that our exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being consummated, and speculation and uncertainty regarding the outcome of our exploration of strategic alternatives may adversely impact our business.\nOn September 30, 2016, we announced that we had engaged a financial advisor and were pursuing strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a possible sale or other form of business combination. In August 2017, we announced that we had terminated our engagement with the financial advisor. While we are continuing to pursue value-enhancing initiatives, there can be no assurance that any transaction will be consummated. The process of exploring strategic alternatives involves the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by our exploration of strategic alternatives, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur principal shareholder has the ability to control the policies and management of our company.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, David Mintz, holds 2,630,440 shares of common stock representing approximately 51.0% of the outstanding shares. For as long as Mr. Mintz has a controlling interest in our company, he will have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to potential mergers or other business combinations involving us, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our incurrence of indebtedness, our issuance of any additional common shares or other equity securities, our repurchase or redemption of common shares and our payment of dividends. Similarly, as long as Mr. Mintz has a controlling interest in our company, he will have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and prevent an acquisition or any other change in control of us.\nTrading on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nSince October 24, 2016 our common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB tier of the electronic quotation system operated by OTC Markets. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the NYSE MKT. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares and the lack of liquidity may negatively impact our ability to pursue strategic alternatives.\nPenny stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders to sell their stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for its shares.\nVolatility of the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our shareholders and us.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to fluctuations in the past and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new and enhanced products;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights;\n\u25cf introduction and adoption of new industry standards;\n\u25cf market conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions;\n\u25cf entry into strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events; and\n\u25cf other events or factors in any of the countries in which we do business, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has been highly volatile. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our performance. In the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation relating to the stock trading and price volatility of the company in question. If we were involved in any securities litigation, it could result in substantial cost to us to defend and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nOur policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our business and, for this reason, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to Changes in the Tax Code\nFederal income tax reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We are still in the process of analyzing this law and its possible effects on our company. The law includes a number of provisions, including the lowering of the United States corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. We have reflected the impact of the Act in our financial statements for 2017, the year of enactment. There are also provisions that may partially offset the benefit of such rate reduction. Financial statement impacts include adjustments for, among other things, the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. While the provisions of the law generally are expected to benefit us, the law remains subject to implementation through rulemaking and administrative guidance that has not yet been implemented. We anticipate that the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations; however, the intended and unintended consequences of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and of future tax legislation on our business are uncertain.", "PERMNO": 68718, "SIC": 2024, "TIC": "TOFB"}
