{"cik": "10048", "company": "BARNWELL INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-12-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell\u2019s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted.\nEntity-Wide Risks\nThe Company faces issues that could impair our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.\nThe Twining reserves acquired consist of proved producing reserves as well as a significant amount of proved reserves that are undeveloped. Our proved undeveloped reserves are estimated to require roughly $14,000,000 in future oil and natural gas capital expenditures to develop within the next five years. Cash flows generated by developed Twining reserves are estimated by our independent reserve engineering firm to be sufficient to fund such capital expenditures. However, as the independent reserve engineering firm\u2019s estimates do not consider items such as our ongoing general and administrative expenses, it is possible that we will need to obtain a significant amount of new financing in the form of debt or equity in order to develop the reserves to the level estimated by our independent reserve engineers.\nOur ability to sustain our business in the future will depend on sufficient oil and natural gas operating cash flows, which are highly sensitive to potentially volatile oil and natural gas prices, sufficient future land investment segment proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell\u2019s control, and our ability to fund our needed oil and natural gas capital expenditures and the level of success of such capital expenditures, as well as our ability to fund oil and natural gas asset retirement obligations and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses.\nManagement believes our current cash balances, working capital and future cash inflows from operations will be sufficient to fund its estimated cash outflows for the next 12 months. However, if oil and natural gas and land investment cash inflows and any needed new financing sources are not sufficient to sustain our longer term business plans, which are currently based upon assumptions and estimates that may not materialize, or if unforeseen circumstances arise that impair our ability to sustain or grow our business, the Company may need to consider further sales of our assets or alternative strategies, or we may be forced to wind down our operations, either through liquidation or bankruptcy, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern in 2020 and beyond.\nA small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two others hold approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.\nOur operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations.\nOur operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.\nAdverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell\u2019s results and financial condition.\nRetirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022\nvariations in results of operations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\ngeneral trends in the industry;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nlitigation; and\n\u2022\nanalysts\u2019 estimates and other events applicable to our industries.\nFailure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.\nRisks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment\nAcquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow.\nSince fiscal 2014, Barnwell has been selectively divesting oil and natural assets to improve operational focus, reduce abandonment liabilities, and decrease the Company's debt burden, however, as a result of these sales, our oil and natural gas segment revenues and operating cash flow have significantly declined. Most notably, in September 2015, we sold our interest in our principal oil and natural gas property Dunvegan, which resulted in a 60% decrease in our proved natural gas reserves and a 34% decrease in our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves. In fiscal 2015, Dunvegan contributed 46% of our total oil and natural gas revenues. In February 2018, we sold our interest in our oil and natural gas property Red Earth. Red Earth represented 0.07% of our proved natural gas reserves and 25% of our proved oil and natural gas liquids reserves as of September 30, 2017, and 22% of our total oil and natural gas revenues in the year ended September 30, 2017.\nIn August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada which resulted in a significant increase in our proved reserves. However, a significant portion of those proved reserves include proved undeveloped reserves for which it is estimated that $14,000,000 in future capital expenditures will need to be made to convert those undeveloped reserves into developed reserves. The ability to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves will be heavily influenced by the cash flows generated by the oil and natural gas segment, the results of such drilling, and the need for and sufficiency of any potential future capital financing. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, our future reserves and resulting operating results and cash flows from our reserves will be less than our expectations and less than the estimations included in this report. Also, continued reinvestment in oil and natural gas segment assets are needed to replace the significant amount of reserves produced and sold.\nFuture oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.\nWe may have difficulty funding oil and natural gas segment capital expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nConversion of our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves will require substantial capital expenditures which we intend to fund using cash on hand and operational cash generated, if any. However, the Company's current cash on hand is likely to be needed to fund upcoming cash needs including asset retirement obligations, retirement plan funding, and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses, such that some or potentially all of the cash will not be available for reinvestment. Future cash flows from operations are uncertain and are based on a number of variables including the level of production from existing wells, oil and natural gas prices, and our success in acquiring and developing new reserves.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Decreases in commodity prices in recent years, among other factors, are causing and may continue to cause lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not be able to satisfy, and reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If additional capital is required, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash on hand and cash generated by operations, if any, is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could limit our ability to fund capital expenditures, and we may need to curtail the development of our proved undeveloped reserves or be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMuch of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.\nVarious factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.\nThe inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nFor our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.\nLiquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds a 10% working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 80 wells where the operator is in receivership.\nWe may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of \u201cclean up\u201d orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations.\nBarnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (\u201cAER\u201d) Licensee Liability Rating (\u201cLLR\u201d) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability Management Ratio (\u201cLMR\u201d) for a company based on the ratio of the company\u2019s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2018, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future.\nThe AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers.\nA requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.\nWe are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy.\nWe may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.\nWe periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller\u2019s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities.\nIn connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.\nIf oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.\nWe compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues.\nAn increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nHigher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.\nOur operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nOur business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline.\nWe are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator\u2019s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs.\nActual reserves will vary from reserve estimates.\nEstimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others:\n\u2022\noil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;\n\u2022\nhistorical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;\n\u2022\nfuture commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ninitial production rates;\n\u2022\nproduction decline rates;\n\u2022\nultimate recovery of reserves;\n\u2022\nsuccess of future development activities;\n\u2022\nmarketability of production;\n\u2022\neffects of government regulation; and\n\u2022\nother government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves.\nIf these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates.\nDelays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows.\nIn addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by:\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by lenders;\n\u2022\naccounting delays;\n\u2022\ndelays in the sale or delivery of products;\n\u2022\ndelays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;\n\u2022\nblowouts or other accidents;\n\u2022\nadjustments for prior periods;\n\u2022\nrecovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and\n\u2022\nthe establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses.\nAny of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks.\nThe oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other\nenvironmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others.\nWhile we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive.\nDeficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions.\nOur operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States.\nBarnwell\u2019s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers\u2019 health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell\u2019s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 41% in fiscal 2018.\nAdditionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S.\nGovernment regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers\u2019 activities, reducing demand for our products and services.\nCompliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.\nTax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nUnforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves.\nAlthough we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized.\nRisks Related to Land Investment Segment\nReceipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer\u2019s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property.\nWe are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. KD II is required to submit an overall status report of the project, including the percentage of completed development, by April 20, 2019. There is a possibility that regulatory authorities could impose adverse conditions of approval that impede the developer's goals, or outright refuse to extend the allowed zoning beyond April 20, 2019, which would have an adverse impact on the value of the property. Currently, a formal request for a 20-year time extension of the original development period was submitted by the general partner and reviewed by the regulatory authorities. Although the initial response has been favorable, a 20-year extension has not been granted to date. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property.\nWe hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid.\nThese investments involve risks which include:\n\u2022\nthe lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;\n\u2022\npotential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;\n\u2022\nthe reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict\nour ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nundisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022\ncertain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.\nWe may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management\u2019s and the general partner\u2019s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii.\nBarnwell\u2019s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii\u2019s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii\u2019s economy and Hawaii\u2019s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell\u2019s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii\u2019s economy.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii.\nRisks Related to Contract Drilling Segment\nDemand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nDemand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.\nContracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.\nA significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business.\nA significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 58% in fiscal 2018. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services.
