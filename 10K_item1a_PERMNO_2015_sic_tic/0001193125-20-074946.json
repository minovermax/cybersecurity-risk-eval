{"cik": "1042074", "company": "CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nRecent clinical setbacks may cause us to liquidate the company.\nIn November 2019, due to histologic observations in our NASH clinical trial, the NASH and PSC clinical trials and programs were terminated and the PBC program was placed on hold. In December 2019 the PBC clinical trials were terminated, pending further analysis of data from the NASH trial and further discussions with the FDA. This course of action terminated, or put on hold, substantially all of our active development programs. While we have several early stage development programs that are continuing, we are exploring various strategic alternatives, including liquidation, sale, merger, asset acquisitions and/or continuing development of our internal programs. If we are unable to restart clinical development of seladelpar, advance our earlier stage development programs, enter into a strategic transaction or acquire or in-license\nadditional assets, or if we determine such alternatives will not be in the best interests of stockholders, we may choose to liquidate the company. Liquidation would take time and the proceeds of the liquidation are uncertain given the extent to which we may need to follow patients from our terminated clinical trials that may or may not have histologic observations.\nWe will need additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations and research.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $190.9 million. If appropriate opportunities become available, or if we are unable to restart clinical development of seladelpar, advance our earlier stage development programs and/or are unable to enter into a strategic transaction and/or acquire or in-license\nadditional assets, we may need to raise additional equity and/or debt capital to fund our continued operations, including clinical trials and other product development. Our monthly spending levels vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete.\nIn the event we do not successfully raise sufficient funds in financing our product development activities or do not have appropriate developmental assets, we will curtail our product development activities commensurate with the magnitude of the shortfall or our product development activities may cease altogether. To the extent that any costs of the ongoing development exceed our current estimates and we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to cover such additional costs, we will need to reduce operating expenses, sell assets, enter into another strategic transaction, or effect a combination of the above. No assurance can be given that we will be able to affect any of such transactions on acceptable terms, if at all.\nBeyond the plan of operations outlined above, our future funding requirements and sources will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 the rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;\n\u2022 the need for additional or expanded clinical studies;\n\u2022 the rate of progress and cost of our Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control development, registration, validation and commercial programs;\n\u2022 the timing, economic and other terms of any licensing, collaboration or other similar arrangement into which we may enter;\n\u2022 the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the extent of our other development activities;\n\u2022 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 the effect of competing products and market developments.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects and on our ability to develop our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate future revenues from product sales is uncertain and depends upon our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize, product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if ever. Our ability to generate revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in generating a pipeline of product candidates.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. Our anticipated development costs would likely increase if we do not obtain favorable results or if development of our product candidates is delayed. In particular, we would likely incur higher costs than we currently anticipate if development of our product candidates is delayed because we are required by a regulatory authority such as the U.S. FDA to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, including whether we will resume development of seladelpar, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of any increase in our anticipated development costs.\nIn addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for\nseveral years, if at all. Even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs in connection with commercialization. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate revenues from sales of any approved product candidates, or that we will achieve or maintain profitability even if we do generate sales.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. If appropriate opportunities become available, we may seek to raise additional equity and/or debt capital to fund our continued operations, including clinical trials and other product development.\nTo raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or debt securities, enter into collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements or other marketing or distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, and declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements or other marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts, or grant others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and we will devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of operating as a public company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated\nfrom time to time. We expect to incur expense and devote management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, including but not limited to system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our future\ntesting may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Implementing certain appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate consolidated financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and/or we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe depend on the success of our product candidates and we may not obtain regulatory approval or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have not marketed, distributed or sold any products. The success of our business depends upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our lead product candidate, seladelpar, has been placed on clinical hold, pending further analysis of data from the NASH trial and further discussions with the FDA. It is uncertain if seladelpar will be taken off clinical hold or what requirements would need to be satisfied to lift the clinical hold. The success of any product candidate will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022 successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022 receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States for the product candidate;\n\u2022 establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities by making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022 launching commercial sales of the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022 acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022 effectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following marketing approval; and\n\u2022 obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidate, which would materially harm our business.\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials for our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. For example, in November 2019, due\nto histologic observations in our NASH clinical trial, the NASH and PSC clinical trials and programs were terminated and the PBC program was placed on hold. In December 2019, the PBC clinical trials were terminated, pending further analysis of data from the NASH trial and further discussions with the FDA. This course of action terminated, or put on hold, substantially all of our active programs. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nWe may experience a number of unforeseen events during clinical trials for our product candidates, including seladelpar, that could delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of our clinical trials, including the following:\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022 the clinical study protocol may require one or more amendments delaying study completion;\n\u2022 clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022 the number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, we may have to compete with other clinical trials to enroll eligible subjects, or subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022 clinical investigators or study subjects fail to comply with clinical study protocols;\n\u2022 trial conduct and data analysis errors may occur, including, but not limited to, data entry and/or labeling errors;\n\u2022 our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022 we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022 the supply or quality of our clinical trial materials or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022 our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nBecause successful development of product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development.\nNegative or inconclusive results of our future clinical trials of product candidates could cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to require that we repeat or conduct additional clinical studies. The histologic observations in our NASH clinical trial may cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to require additional testing in order to lift the clinical hold on seladelpar. If later stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.\nWe have terminated development of seladelpar for all indications. If seladelpar is not taken off clinical hold or does not demonstrate safety or efficacy, or if the benefits of treatment with seladelpar do not outweigh the risks, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize seladelpar will be stopped.\nWe commenced clinical trials of seladelpar for the indications for PBC, PSC and NASH. In November 2019, due to histologic observations in our NASH clinical trial, the NASH and PSC clinical trials and programs were terminated and the PBC program was placed on hold. In December 2019 the PBC clinical trials were terminated, pending further analysis of data from the NASH trial and further discussions with the FDA. This course of action terminated, or put on hold, substantially all of our active development programs. Seladelpar may not be demonstrated to be effective in these indications or other indications we may target. There is no guarantee that seladelpar will be taken off clinical hold or will prove to be safe or efficacious in the treatment of any disease, or that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any indication.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates and any delay could result in increased costs to us. Any clinical trials we undertake may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nEvents that may result in delays or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials include the following:\n\u2022 inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022 delays in reaching agreement with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on final trial design;\n\u2022 imposition of a clinical hold following a reported safety event;\n\u2022 an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining required institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site;\n\u2022 delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022 delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022 delays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u2022 changes to treatment guidelines or the introduction of a new standard of care;\n\u2022 delays caused by clinical sites dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022 time required to add new clinical sites;\n\u2022 delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials; and\n\u2022 delays in importing clinical trial materials into foreign countries where our clinical trials are being conducted.\nIf initiation or completion of any clinical trials we may undertake for our product candidates is delayed for any of the above reasons, our development costs may increase, the approval process could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates may be reduced\nand our competitors may bring products to market before us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nIn May 2016, we announced results a High Dose Phase 2 clinical study of seladelpar in patients with PBC. During the course of this trial three cases of asymptomatic, reversible transaminase elevations occurred, and we made the decision to discontinue the study early after review of safety and efficacy data demonstrated a need for further dose reduction to optimize clinical safety and efficacy. In November 2019, due to histologic observations in our NASH clinical trial, the NASH and PSC clinical trials were terminated and programs and the PBC program was placed on hold. In December 2019 the PBC clinical trials were terminated, pending further analysis of data from the NASH trial and further discussions with the FDA. This course of action terminated, or put on hold, substantially all of our active development programs. The emergence of adverse events (AEs) and histological observations in a seladelpar clinical trial could prevent us from further developing seladelpar or could result in the denial of regulatory approval.\nFurthermore, if any of our approved products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including the following:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) plan;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as black box or other warnings or contraindications that could diminish the usage of the product or otherwise limit the commercial success of the affected product;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022 we may choose to discontinue sale of the product;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community, the revenues that it generates from its sales will be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety, as demonstrated in clinical studies;\n\u2022 the risk/benefit profile of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022 the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u2022 acceptance of the product by physicians, other health care providers and patients as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including if physicians prescribe our products for uses outside the approved indications;\n\u2022 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022 the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our or our partners\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution efforts.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and we may not become or remain profitable.\nPotential conflicts of interest arising from relationships with principal investigators for our clinical studies and any related compensation with respect to clinical studies could adversely affect the drug approval process.\nPrincipal investigators for our clinical studies may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us or may be affiliated with our other service providers, including clinical research organizations or site management organizations, and from time to time receive cash compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical study site or in the applicable study may be questioned or jeopardized.\nWe may be subject to costly claims related to our clinical studies and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.\nBecause we conduct clinical studies in humans, we face the risk that the use of seladelpar or other product candidates will result in adverse side effects. We cannot predict the possible harms or side effects that may result from our clinical studies. Although we have clinical study liability insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover any such events. There is also a risk that we may not be able to continue to obtain clinical study coverage on acceptable terms. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limit of, our insurance coverage. There is also a risk that third parties that we have agreed to indemnify could incur liability. Any litigation arising from our clinical studies, even if we are ultimately successful, would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and may create adverse publicity.\nAfter the completion of our clinical trials, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue from our product candidates. Regulatory approval of a product candidate is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive, uncertain and lengthy.\nWe cannot commercialize our product candidates until the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, have reviewed and approved the product candidate. The regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. Additional delays may result if a product candidate is brought before an FDA advisory committee, which could recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non-approval\nof the product candidate. In addition, we may\nexperience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. As a result, we cannot predict when, if at all, we will receive any future revenue from commercialization of any of our product candidates. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical studies sufficient or may differ in the interpretation of the data;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require additional nonclinical or clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA or foreign regulatory authority might not approve our third party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities for clinical or commercial product;\n\u2022 the FDA or foreign regulatory authority may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n\u2022 the FDA or foreign regulatory authority may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA or foreign regulatory authority may not accept clinical data from studies that are conducted in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the United States;\n\u2022 the results of clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022 we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; and\n\u2022 the data collection from clinical studies of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application (NDA), marketing authorization or other equivalent submission, or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased caution by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. Our product candidates would be subject to additional ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. Furthermore, promotional materials must be approved by the FDA prior to use for any drug receiving accelerated approval.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with\ncurrent Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we, or a regulatory agency, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as quality issues or AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requesting recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we, or our third party contractors, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of our product candidate, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue an untitled or warning letter asserting violation of the law;\n\u2022 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties up to and including imprisonment or monetary fines;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA; or\n\u2022 request recall and/or seize product.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and inhibit our ability to generate revenues.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. If we are found to have improperly promoted our products for off-label\nuses, we may become subject to significant fines and other liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, physicians may nevertheless prescribe such products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label\nuses, we may become subject to significant government fines and other related liability. For example, the federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label\npromotion. The FDA also has requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval for our product candidates in the United States, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country\nbasis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials that could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction,\nincluding international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized.\nOur relationships with health care professionals, customers and payors may be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealth care professionals and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare professionals, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the federal false statements statute, the federal transparency requirements under the PPACA, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded health care programs.\nCurrent laws and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFor example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the PPACA Although the full effect of the PPACA remains uncertain, it appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens\nand operating costs. Further, other legislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted, such as the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which have resulted in reduced reimbursement under the Medicare program.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. In addition, there have been several recent congressional inquiries, proposed bills and other proposals designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products including instituting reference pricing. At the federal level, the Trump administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates.\nWe do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers for supply of our preclinical and clinical drug supplies. We expect that in the future we will continue to rely on such manufacturers for drug supplies that will be used in clinical trials of our product candidates, and for commercialization of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture the approved product must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted only after we submit an NDA to the FDA, if at all. A representative from the EMA or another regulatory authority may also require inspection and approval of such contract manufacturing facilities. We are completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements for manufacture of finished pharmaceutical products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the FDA\u2019s strict regulatory requirements of safety, purity and potency, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for our product candidates. In addition, we have no direct control over the ability of the contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If our contract manufacturers cannot meet FDA standards, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product. No assurance can be given that our manufacturers can continue to make clinical and commercial supplies of product candidates, at an appropriate scale and cost to make it commercially feasible.\nIn addition, we do not have the capability to package and distribute finished products to pharmacies and other customers. If we receive marketing approval from the FDA, we intend to sell pharmaceutical product packaged and distributed by one or more pharmaceutical product packagers/distributors. Although we have entered into agreements with our current contract manufacturers and packager/distributor for clinical trial\nmaterial, we may enter into commercial agreements with contract manufacturers and with one or more pharmaceutical product packagers/distributors to ensure proper supply chain management once we are authorized to make commercial sales of our product candidates. However, we may be unable to maintain agreements or negotiate commercial supply agreements on commercially reasonable terms with contract manufacturers and pharmaceutical product packagers/distributors, which could delay our ability to launch commercial sales and/or have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nWe rely on limited sources of supply for our product candidates, and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause delay in developing and commercializing for each product candidate.\nIf supply from an approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply of our products. An alternative vendor would need to be qualified through a supplemental registration, which would be expensive, time consuming and could result in further delay. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if a new drug substance or drug product supplier is relied upon for commercial production. These factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our products, and cause us to incur additional costs. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, the supply chain for our products may be delayed, which could inhibit our ability to generate revenues.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization of our products.\nAs the manufacturing processes are scaled up they may reveal manufacturing challenges or previously unknown impurities that could require resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the commercial marketing of our products. In the future, we may identify manufacturing issues or impurities that could result in delays in the clinical program and regulatory approval for our products, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including the following:\n\u2022 the inability to meet our product specifications, including product formulation, and quality requirements consistently;\n\u2022 a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022 manufacturing and product quality issues, including those related to scale-up\nof manufacturing;\n\u2022 costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u2022 a failure to comply with cGMP and similar quality standards;\n\u2022 the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022 termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022 the reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for key materials, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these key materials, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;\n\u2022 the lack of qualified backup suppliers for those materials that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;\n\u2022 operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;\n\u2022 disruption of the distribution of chemical supplies between the U.K. and E.U. due to Brexit;\n\u2022 carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022 the failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nAny of these events could lead to delays in any clinical study we may undertake, failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory authorities\u2019 action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe rely on contract service providers (CSPs), including clinical research organizations, clinical trial sites, central laboratories and other service providers to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We have relied and plan to continue to rely upon CSPs to monitor and manage data for clinical programs for our product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CSPs\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CSPs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and our CSPs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s guidance, which follows the International Counsel for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our product candidates in clinical development. The FDA enforces the ICH GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CSPs fail to comply with the ICH GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Our CSPs are not our employees, and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs. These CSPs may also have relationships with other entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our confidential information, including our intellectual property, by CSPs, which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology, among other things. If our CSPs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe commercial success of any product candidate will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless be unable to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, health care payors and others in the medical community. If\nthese products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 the risk/benefit profile of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022 limitations or warnings contained in the FDA and other regulatory authorities approved label for the relevant product candidate;\n\u2022 acceptance of the product by physicians, other health care providers and patients as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022 pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain formulary approval;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement, which may vary from country to country; and\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution efforts.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not become or remain profitable.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe currently do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical\ncapabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We may enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to build our own sales force or negotiate a strategic partnership for the commercialization of our product candidates, we may be forced to delay the potential commercialization of the product, or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring the product to market or generate product revenue.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable.\nWe will be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIn addition, there are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf our product candidates are approved for commercialization outside the United States, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to international operations, including the following:\n\u2022 different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022 reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay\nsystems and price controls;\n\u2022 economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022 compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022 foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022 foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022 workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022 production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022 business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, pandemics, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, floods and fires.\nWe have no prior experience in these areas. In addition, there are complex regulatory, tax, labor and other legal requirements imposed by both the European Union and many of the individual countries in Europe with which we will need to comply. Many U.S.-based biopharmaceutical companies have found the process of marketing their own products in Europe to be very challenging.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our own, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and possibly from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions that are researching, developing and marketing\nproducts designed to address diseases that we are seeking to treat. Our competitors generally have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in the clinical testing of, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and marketing of, drugs. New developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace.\nThese developments may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, potential competitors may have substantially greater:\n\u2022 research and development resources, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022 regulatory experience;\n\u2022 experience in pharmaceutical development and commercialization;\n\u2022 ability to negotiate competitive pricing and reimbursement with third-party payors;\n\u2022 experience and expertise in the exploitation of intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 capital resources.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. The competitors may also develop products that are more effective, better tolerated, more useful and less costly than our products and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of seladelpar, and our other product candidates, in human clinical studies, and will face an even greater risk if we sell our products commercially. An individual or a group of individuals may bring a liability claim against us if one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in the following:\n\u2022 decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022 impairment to our business reputation;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022 distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u2022 loss of revenues.\nWe carry product liability insurance for our clinical studies. Further, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for any of our product candidates. However, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms and with insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits relating to marketed pharmaceuticals. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. We may focus our efforts and resources on product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our products and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our products and product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own, co-own\nor in-license\nmay fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover the products in the United States or in other countries. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against our product candidates in development. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability, scope or ownership, which may result in such patents, or our rights to such patents, being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the patent applications we hold or license with respect to our product candidates fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us and threaten our ability to commercialize our products. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will be found invalid or unenforceable, will be challenged by third parties or will adequately protect our products and product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in development or regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market our products under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be provoked by a third party or instituted by us to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license it from the prevailing party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how\nthat is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how,\ninformation or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we expect all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how,\ninformation or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, that such agreements provide adequate protection\nand will not be breached, that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not otherwise be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented\nintellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect patents and other proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property abroad. We may also fail to pursue or obtain patents and other intellectual property protection relating to our products and product candidates in all foreign countries.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts or otherwise affect our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement and other violations of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter party re-examination\nproceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. PTO) and its foreign counterparts. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that our product candidates or other business activities may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriating the trade secrets of others, and to the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property or proprietary information owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how\nand inventions.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our affected\nproducts, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our products or product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nWe license certain key intellectual property from third parties, and the loss of our license rights could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe are a party to a number of technology licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For example, we rely on an exclusive license to certain patents and know-how\nfrom Janssen Pharmaceutical NV (Janssen NV), which include seladelpar and certain other PPARd\ncompounds (the PPARd\nProducts). Under the exclusive license with Janssen NV we have full control and responsibility over the research, development and registration of any PPARd\nProducts and are required to use diligent efforts to conduct all such activities. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our agreement with Janssen NV, including our obligations to expend more than a de minimis amount of effort and resources on the research and/or development of at least one PPARd\nproduct, to make any payment called for under the agreement, not to disclose any non-exempt\nconfidential information related to the agreement, or to use diligent efforts to promote, market and sell any PPARd\nProduct under the agreement, such action would constitute a default under the agreement and Janssen NV may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license, including in the case of the Janssen NV license, seladelpar, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter-claims against us.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be harmed if in a litigation if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance\nwith these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The U.S. PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance\nevents that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment\nof fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors that control the prosecution and maintenance of our licensed patents fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, we may lose our rights and our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and impact the trading value of our securities. Stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Stockholder activism, including a proxy contest, could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key executives and business partners, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist stockholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by stockholder activism.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team. While we have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. We also experience competition from universities and research institutions for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. In addition, failure of any of our clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. If we are unable to successfully recruit key employees or replace the loss of services of any executive or key employee, it may adversely affect the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with\nother entities that may limit their availability to us, which could also adversely affect the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe recently reduced the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties as a result of this downsizing.\nIn December 2019 we announced a reduction in workforce of approximately 60% and have proceeded with additional cost cutting measures. This has resulted in a decrease in our managerial, clinical, and operational resources resulting in significant additional responsibilities for our remaining management and employees. We may not be able to effectively manage our downsized operations with the remaining workforce, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of additional employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. If our management is unable to effectively manage our downsized operations, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our downsized operations and any future growth.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event is to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or our vendors, it may result in a material disruption of our product development programs and our reputation could be materially damaged. We could also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and failures to comply with United States and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as\ninformation that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our vendors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. In the event that we are subject to HIPAA or other United States privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our customers, or our vendors must comply. For example, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal information of EU subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR is likely to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for robust regulatory enforcement and fines for a noncompliant company. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue and the market price for our common stock may decline in value.\nOur common stock has historically been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCBAY\u201d and in the second quarter of 2018 it began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Historically, trading volume for our common stock has been limited. The historical trading prices of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Nasdaq Global Select Market may not be indicative of the price levels at which our common stock will trade in the future, and we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us generally will continue to support an active public trading market for our common stock or how liquid will be that public market.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price is volatile, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur stock price is volatile, and our stockholders\u2019 investment in our stock could decline in value.\nThe historical trading price of our common stock has been volatile. Our stock price may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 adverse or inconclusive results or delays in preclinical testing or clinical trials;\n\u2022 inability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022 any delay in filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or NDA for any of our future product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of an IND or NDA;\n\u2022 failure to maintain our existing collaborations or enter into new collaborations;\n\u2022 failure of our collaboration partners to elect to develop or commercialize product candidates under our collaboration agreements or the termination of any programs under our collaboration agreements;\n\u2022 failure by us or our licensors and collaboration partners to prosecute, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 failure to successfully develop and commercialize our future product candidates;\n\u2022 changes in laws or regulations applicable to future products;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of payment systems;\n\u2022 inability to obtain adequate product supply for our future product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022 adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022 introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022 failure to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022 failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022 the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022 announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us, our collaboration partners or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements of significant or potential equity or debt sales by us;\n\u2022 announcements of clinical trial plans or results by us;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022 significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022 changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u2022 trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, companies trading in the stock market in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nSignificant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our product development efforts, in particular clinical trial, and operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If in the future we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in new investors gaining rights superior to our existing stockholders. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under our equity incentive plans as of February 29, 2020 was 2,722,567 shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price is volatile, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Finally, our charter documents establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14691, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CBAY"}
