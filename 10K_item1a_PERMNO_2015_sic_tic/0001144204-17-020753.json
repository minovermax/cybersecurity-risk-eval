{"cik": "1606163", "company": "Limbach Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. Any risk described below may have a material adverse impact on Limbach's business or financial condition. Some statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Limbach management's current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCertain of the markets where we work have not experienced a full recovery of construction activity coming out of the most recent economic downturn.\nConstruction activity and opportunity in certain markets in Ohio and Western Pennsylvania has not returned to pre-recessionary levels. Competition in these markets remains intense. This lack of construction activity may materially and adversely affect our business because our business is dependent on levels of construction activity.\nOur contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nWe cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in the contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may materially and adversely affect the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\nBecause we bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above estimates.\nOur contract prices are established largely upon estimates and assumptions of our projected costs, including assumptions about: future economic conditions; prices, including commodities prices; availability of labor, including the costs of providing labor, equipment, and materials; and other factors outside our control. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate, if circumstances change in a way that renders assumptions and estimates inaccurate or we fail to successfully execute the work, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. For instance, unanticipated technical problems may arise; we could have difficulty obtaining permits or approvals; local laws, labor costs or labor conditions could change; bad weather could delay construction; raw materials prices could increase; suppliers or subcontractors may fail to perform as expected; or site conditions may be different than expected. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date. This includes our performance contracting services tied to energy savings on retrofitted energy conservation projects. Failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs to us, and in some cases may also create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. Performance problems for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated and could damage our reputation within the industry and our customer base.\nThe costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 on-site conditions that differ from those in the original bid or contract;\n\u2022 failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum or guaranteed maximum price contract;\n\u2022 contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;\n\u2022 failure by the customer, owner or general contractor to properly approve and authorize change orders for work that is required and as a result, the inability to bill and collect for the value of the work performed;\n\u2022 failure by suppliers, vendors, subcontractors, designers, engineers, consultants, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022 delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during contract execution;\n\u2022 changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including pipe, sheet metal, and other construction materials;\n\u2022 claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part;\n\u2022 difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022 availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;\n\u2022 citations issued by any governmental authority, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;\n\u2022 unexpected labor conditions or work stoppages;\n\u2022 changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022 delays caused by weather conditions;\n\u2022 fraud, theft or other improper activities by suppliers, vendors, subcontractors, designers, engineers, consultants, joint venture partners or customers or our own personnel; and\n\u2022 mechanical or performance problems with equipment.\nMany of our contracts with our customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. We are not always able to shift this risk to subcontractors. Our experience has often been that customers are willing to negotiate equitable adjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. However, customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.\nWith our IPD contracts, a portion of our overhead and profit may be at risk.\nWith IPD projects, the parties to the agreement typically place a portion of their overhead and profit into a profit pool. If savings exist, the profit pool could increase. If there are cost overruns by any party, the profit pool could be reduced or eliminated, leading to the Company having its costs and certain overheads recovered, but it could lead to no gross profit being recognized on an IPD project.\nIntense competition in our industry could reduce our market share and profit.\nThe markets we serve are highly fragmented and competitive. The industry is characterized by many small companies whose activities are geographically concentrated. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, industry reputation and dependability. While we believe our customers consider a number of these factors in awarding available contracts, a large portion of our work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often the principal factor in determining which contractor is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower cost and financial return requirements. We expect competition to intensify in the industry, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. We also expect increased competition from in-house service providers, because some of our customers have employees who perform service and maintenance work similar to the services we provide. Vertical consolidation is also expected to intensify competition in the industry. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we will lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. In addition, our profitability will be impaired if we have to reduce prices to remain competitive.\nOur business has union and open shop operations, subjecting the business to risk for labor disputes.\nWe have separate subsidiary employers that have union and non-union operations. Our management regularly reviews our organizational structure for compliance with all contractual and legal obligations. Our management and professional advisors believe that the Company is properly organized, but there is a risk that the structure and operations could be challenged by one of the unions. An adverse claim or judgment resulting from such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur success depends upon the continuing contributions of certain key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. If we lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of one or more of these individuals, our operating results could suffer.\nOur continuing success depends on the performance of our management team. We cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of our key executives who may choose to leave the company for any number of reasons, such as other business opportunities, differing views on strategic direction or other reasons. We rely on the experience, efforts and abilities of these individuals, each of whom would be difficult to replace.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers, employees, joint venture partners and subcontractors, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur business is labor intensive, and many of our operations experience a high rate of employment turnover. At times of low unemployment rates in the United States, it will be more difficult to find qualified personnel in some geographic areas where we operate. Additionally, our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers. Generally, the industry is facing a shortage of trained, skilled, and qualified management, operational, and field personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain the sufficient skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. Changes in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners may make it difficult to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work. Our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages, increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel could reduce our profitability and negatively impact our business. Further, our relationship with some customers could suffer if we are unable to retain the employees with whom those customers primarily work and have established relationships.\nOur inability to properly utilize our workforce could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nThe extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. Underutilizing the workforce could result in lower gross margins and, consequently, a decrease in short-term profitability. On the other hand, overutilization of our workforce could negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction and project execution, leading to a potential decline in future project awards. The utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022 our estimates of headcount requirements and our ability to manage attrition;\n\u2022 efficiency in scheduling projects and our ability to minimize downtime between project assignments;\n\u2022 productivity;\n\u2022 labor disputes; and\n\u2022 availability of skilled labor at any given time.\nOur failure to comply with immigrant labor regulations could affect our business.\nIn certain markets, we rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our management has identified, or will identify in the future, all illegal immigrants who work for us. The failure to identify illegal immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon the company, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.\nAs part of our business, we are a party to special purpose, project specific joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon the various risks discussed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.\nWe and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of the joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner\u2019s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner\u2019s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduction to our profit on a project.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) contractors to perform as subcontractors.\nCertain of our projects contain minimum DBE participation clauses. If we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum DBE participation, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects, as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed the original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nStrikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results.\nWe are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of our craft workforce. Although strikes, work stoppages and other labor disputes have not had a significant impact on our operations or results in the past, such labor actions, or an inability to renew the collective bargaining agreements, could materially and adversely impact on our operations and results if they occur in the future.\nTiming of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow.\nA substantial portion of our revenues and earnings is generated from large-scale project awards. The timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including a customer\u2019s decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions, and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid upon due to price, a customer\u2019s perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable. Because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly and annually depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated.\nThe uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.\nIn addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions; other subcontractors delaying the progression of proceeding work; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have material and adverse effects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions.\nDesign-build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery as it provides the customer with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. When we are awarded these projects we typically perform the design and engineering work in-house. In the event of a design error or omission by us causing damages, there is risk that we, the subcontractor or the respective professional liability insurance or errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDue to the size and nature of our regional construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past, and may in the future, represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, a single customer represented approximately 24% and 11% of our consolidated total revenues for the Successor period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016, respectively. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.\nWe rely heavily on third-party subcontractors to perform some, and often a majority, of the work on many of our contracts. We also rely almost exclusively on third-party suppliers to provide the materials (including pipe, sheet metal and control systems) for our contracts. If we are unable to retain qualified subcontractors or suppliers, or if our subcontractors or suppliers do not perform as anticipated for any reason, our execution and profitability could be harmed. By contract, we remain liable to our customers for the performance or failures of our subcontractors and suppliers.\nWe generally do not bid on projects unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials and equipment and from subcontractors for the services required to complete the projects at prices that have been included in the bid. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials and equipment, and from subcontractors for services needed, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier or subcontractor is unable to deliver materials, equipment or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for any reason, including the deterioration of our financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials, equipment and services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.\nEarnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment each year, and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred. We may determine in the future that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized intangible assets or fixed assets, which could require us to write off a portion of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition or reported results of operations.\nActual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.\nWe have been and are likely to continue to be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages in connection with the operation of our business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, or allegations of violations of applicable securities laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. We also are, and will likely continue to be, from time to time a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payment of contractual amounts we are owed, as well as claims for increased costs we incur. When appropriate, we will establish provisions against possible exposures, and adjust these provisions from time to time according to ongoing exposure. If the assumptions and estimates related to these exposures prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating the business.\nWe typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. If warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied work in place at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits.\nA material portion of our revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which results in recognizing contract revenue and earnings ratably over the contract term in the proportion that our actual costs bear to our estimated contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on an ongoing basis. Prior to contract completion, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original contract, collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced, or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred by us due to customer-induced delays and other factors. Contract losses are recognized in the fiscal period when the loss is determined. Contract profit estimates are also adjusted in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment is required. As a result of the requirements of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, the possibility exists, for example, that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several periods and later determined, usually near contract completion, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be reported for the period in which such determination is made, thereby eliminating all or a portion of any profits from other contracts that would have otherwise been reported in such period, or even resulting in a loss being reported for such period. On a historical basis, we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long-term contracts. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to materially and adversely vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits.\nA significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. Any difficulties in the financial and surety markets may cause a material adverse effect on our bonding capacity and availability.\nIn the past we have expanded, and it is possible we will continue to expand, the number and percentage of total contract dollars that require an underlying construction surety bond (bid, payment, and performance bonds). Historically, surety market conditions have experienced times of difficulty as a result of significant losses incurred by many surety companies and the results of macroeconomic trends outside of our control. Consequently, during times when less overall bonding capacity is available in the market, surety terms have become more expensive and more restrictive. As such, we cannot guarantee our ability to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude our ability to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with some customers. Additionally, even if we continue to be able to access bonding capacity to sufficiently bond future work, we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds, which would decrease the liquidity we would have available for other purposes. Our surety providers are under no commitment to guarantee our access to new bonds in the future; thus, our ability to access or increase bonding capacity is at the sole discretion of our surety providers. If our surety companies were to limit or eliminate our access to bonds, the alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. As such, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, it is likely we would be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\nWe place significant decision making powers with our subsidiaries\u2019 management, which presents certain risks.\nWe believe that our practice of placing significant decision making powers with local management is important to our successful growth and allows us to be responsive to opportunities and to customers\u2019 needs. However, this practice presents certain risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less effective in our attempts to identify or react to problems affecting an important business issue than we would under a more centralized structure, or that we would be slower to identify a misalignment between a subsidiary\u2019s and our overall business strategy. Further, if a subsidiary location fails to follow our compliance policies, we could be made party to a contract, arrangement or situation that requires the exposure of large liabilities or has less advantageous terms than is typically found in the market.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions or cyber security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe use sophisticated information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure in conducting some of our day-to-day operations and providing services to certain customers, including technology used for building designs, project modeling and scheduling. Information technology system failures, including suppliers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 system failures, could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, other business disruptions, or the loss of employee personal information. In addition, these systems, networks, and infrastructure may be vulnerable to deliberate cyber-attacks that interfere with their functionality or the confidentiality of our information or our customers\u2019 data. These events could impact our customers, employees and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business or potential liability, or an increase in expense, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur insurance policies against many potential liabilities require high deductibles. Additionally, difficulties in the insurance markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary insurance.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to our related exposures, these policies are subject to high deductibles; as such, we are, in effect, self-insured for substantially all of our typical claims. Our estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses and the appropriateness of the estimated liability are reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents that have occurred but are not reported, and the effectiveness of our safety program. Our accruals are based on known facts, historical trends (both internal trends and industry averages) and our reasonable estimate of our future expenses. We believe our accruals are adequate. However, our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating the risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. If any of the variety of instruments, processes or strategies we use to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies or that exceed our accruals or coverage limits.\nAdditionally, we typically are contractually required to provide proof of insurance on projects we work on. Historically, insurance market conditions become more difficult for insurance consumers during periods when insurance companies suffer significant investment losses as well as casualty losses. Consequently, it is possible that insurance markets will become more expensive and restrictive. Also, our prior casualty loss history might adversely affect our ability to procure insurance within commercially reasonable ranges. As such, we may not be able to maintain commercially reasonable levels of insurance coverage in the future, which could preclude our ability to work on many projects. Our insurance providers are under no commitment to renew our existing insurance policies in the future; therefore, our ability to obtain necessary levels or kinds of insurance coverage are subject to market forces outside our control. If we are unable to obtain necessary levels of insurance, we likely would be unable to compete for or work on most projects.\nIf we experience delays and/or defaults in customer payments, we could be unable to recover all expenditures.\nBecause of the nature of our contracts, at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred. Delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment. If a customer defaults in making their payments on a project to which we have devoted resources, it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.\nMisconduct by our employees, subcontractors or partners or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one or more of our employees, subcontractors or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Examples of such misconduct include employee or subcontractor theft, the failure to comply with safety standards, laws and regulations, customer requirements, environmental laws, DBE regulatory compliance, and any other applicable laws or regulations. While we take precautions to prevent and detect these activities, such precautions may not be effective and are subject to inherent limitations, including human error and fraud. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, harm our reputation, damage relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nFailure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations, and business.\nWe plan to continue to maintain and strengthen internal controls and procedures to enhance the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are ineffective due to two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with our 2016 audit, our management conducted an assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the existence of two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were ineffective. Specifically, our management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016:\n\u00b7 We have not yet fully developed the required accounting and financial reporting control environment to achieve sufficient precision and timeliness of review. We have not established access review controls for employees who post journal entries to ensure that access is required for their job responsibilities. The infrastructure of the accounting department, including the complement of personnel, is not sufficient to account for complex or infrequent transactions, such as business combinations, preferred stock, warrants and convertible debt, to review the work of third-party consultants, material agreements, and journal entries and medical claims incurred but not reported and underlying support with the necessary level of precision in management review controls, or to fully handle SEC reporting requirements. Limitations with our current financial close processes and supporting systems adversely impact our ability to generate financial statements that are free of material misstatement on a timely basis; and\n\u00b7 We have not yet established processes and internal controls sufficient to properly accrue for all goods and services received at project sites, but not invoiced to the Company on a timely basis.\nSee Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures for further discussion of these material weaknesses.\nOur remediation efforts will require significant resources and attention from our management. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to assert in future reports that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. This could cause investors, counterparties and customers to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness and/or a decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have subsidiary operations throughout the United States and are exposed to multiple state and local regulations, as well as federal laws and requirements applicable to government contractors. Changes in laws, regulations or requirements, or a material failure of any of our subsidiaries or us to comply with any of them, could increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nOur 10 branch locations operate in 18 states, which exposes us to a variety of state and local laws and regulations, particularly those pertaining to contractor licensing requirements. These laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business, and there are often different standards and requirements in different locations. In addition, our subsidiaries that perform work for federal government entities are subject to additional federal laws and regulatory and contractual requirements. Changes in any of these laws, or any subsidiary\u2019s material failure to comply with them, can adversely impact our operations by, among other things, increasing costs, distracting management\u2019s time and attention from other items, and harming our reputation.\nAs Federal Government Contractors under applicable federal regulations, our subsidiaries are subject to a number of rules and regulations, and our contracts with government entities are subject to audit. Violations of the applicable rules and regulations could result in a subsidiary being barred from future government contracts.\nFederal Government Contractors must comply with many regulations and other requirements that relate to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. A violation of these laws and regulations could result in imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of a government contract, or debarment from bidding on government contracts in the future. Further, despite our decentralized nature, a violation at one of our locations could impact the ability of the other locations to bid on and perform government contracts; additionally, because of our decentralized nature, we face risk in maintaining compliance with all local, state and federal government contracting requirements. Prohibition against bidding on future government contracts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPast and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.\nHVAC systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including the Clean Air Act and those regulating the production, servicing and disposal of certain ozone-depleting refrigerants used in HVAC systems. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future. Various local, state and federal laws and regulations impose licensing standards on technicians who install and service HVAC systems. And additional laws, regulations and standards apply to contractors who perform work that is being funded by public money, particularly federal public funding. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines, the loss of licenses or potentially debarment from future publicly-funded work. It is impossible to predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.\nOur projects are conducted at a variety of sites including construction sites and industrial facilities. Each location is subject to numerous safety risks, including electrocutions, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, weather-related incidents, transportation accidents and damage to equipment. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages, and could lead to suspension of operations, large damage claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. While we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize safety risks, we have experienced serious accidents in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in significant costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, like other companies in our industry, we track our injury history in the form of an Experience Modification Rate (\u201cEMR\u201d). In the event that the EMR associated with certain of our operating units exceeds the minimum threshold set by customers, we may be unable to pursue certain projects. Poor safety performance could also jeopardize our relationships with our customers and harm our reputation.\nIf we do not effectively manage the size and cost of our operations, our existing infrastructure may become either strained or over-burdensome, and we may be unable to increase revenue growth.\nThe growth that we have experienced in the past, and that we may experience in the future, may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to expand our personnel and operations. Future growth may strain our infrastructure, operations and other managerial and operating resources. We have also experienced severe constriction in the markets in which we operated in the past and, as a result, in our operating requirements. Failing to maintain the appropriate cost structure for a particular economic cycle may result in us incurring costs that affect our profitability. If our business resources become strained or over-burdensome, our earnings may be adversely affected and we may be unable to increase revenue growth. Further, we may undertake contractual commitments that exceed our labor resources, which could also adversely affect our earnings and ability to increase revenue growth.\nWe are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, which may harm our business and financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by severe weather in areas where we have significant operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022 curtailment of services;\n\u2022 suspension of operations;\n\u2022 inability to meet performance schedules in accordance with contracts and potential liability for liquidated damages;\n\u2022 injuries or fatalities;\n\u2022 weather related damage to facilities;\n\u2022 disruption of information systems;\n\u2022 inability to receive machinery, equipment and materials at jobsites; and\n\u2022 loss of productivity.\nForce majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorists\u2019 actions, could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure, or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact us. We attempt to negotiate contract language seeking to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. When successful, we remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nDeliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism and sabotage, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us.\nIntentional acts of destruction could damage or destroy our facilities, reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace facilities at substantial cost. Additionally, employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury from acts of terrorism for which we could be liable. Governmental authorities may also impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. The consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce future profitability.\nIn 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the majority of the provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The Affordable Care Act places requirements on employers to provide a minimum level of benefits to employees and assesses penalties on employers if the benefits do not meet the required minimum level or if the cost of coverage to employees exceeds affordability thresholds specified in the Affordable Care Act. The minimum benefits and affordability requirements took effect in 2015. The Affordable Care Act also imposes an excise tax beginning in 2018 on plans whose average cost exceeds specified amounts. Although our initial assessment indicates that the provisions in the Affordable Care Act will not have a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, it is difficult to predict the financial and operational impacts due to the breadth and complexity of this legislation.\nOur future acquisitions may not be successful.\nWe expect to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses. We cannot assure that we will be able to locate acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that acquired businesses will be profitable. Acquisitions may expose us to additional business risks different than those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions.\nWe may choose to finance future acquisitions with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. Future acquisitions could dilute earnings. To the extent we succeed in making acquisitions, a number of risks will result, including:\n\u2022 the assumption of material liabilities (including for environmental-related costs and multiemployer pension plans);\n\u2022 failure of due diligence to uncover situations that could result in legal exposure or to quantify the true liability exposure from known risks;\n\u2022 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022 difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees, in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations, and the retention of employees generally;\n\u2022 the risk of additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022 potential inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits anticipated prior to the acquisition; and\n\u2022 increased exposure to challenges to the validity of our \u201cdouble breasted\u201d structure (i.e., union and open shop subsidiaries) under the National Labor Relations Act if an \u201copen shop\u201d business is acquired.\nThe failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA change in tax laws or regulations of any federal or state jurisdiction in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal or state legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S. federal or state taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing the cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur obligation to contribute to multiemployer pension plans could give rise to significant expenses and liabilities in the future.\nWe contribute to approximately 50 multiemployer pension plans in the United States under collective bargaining agreements that generally provide pension benefits to employees covered by these agreements. Approximately 53.6% of our current employees are members of collective bargaining units. Our Predecessor contributions to multiemployer pension plans were approximately $26.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and $16.7 million for the period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016. Our Successor contributions to these plans were approximately $16.1 million for the period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer pension plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability. Based upon the information available to us from the multiemployer pension plans\u2019 administrators, we believe that several of these multiemployer pension plans are underfunded. The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in required increased future payments by us and the other participating employers. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan.\nWith limited exception, an employer who is obligated under a collective bargaining agreement to contribute a to multiemployer pension plan is liable, upon termination of such contribution obligation to the plan or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested pension liabilities. In the event that we withdraw from participation in a plan, applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability contributions to such plan, and we would have to reflect that liability and the related expense in our consolidated financial statements. Our withdrawal liability payable to an individual multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. If the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate have significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. No liability for underfunding of multiemployer pension plans was recorded in our Predecessor consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, or the period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016, or in our Successor Consolidated Financial Statements for the period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nRising inflation and/or interest rates, or deterioration of the United States economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, could have a negative impact on our business. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. To the extent that Congress is unable to lower United States debt substantially, a decrease in federal spending could result, which could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new infrastructure projects. In addition, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world, which may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain financing and/or could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. These and related economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFailure to remain in compliance with covenants under our debt and credit agreements or service our indebtedness could adversely impact our business.\nOur credit agreement and other debt obligations include certain debt covenants, including, certain financial covenants, are more described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our failure to comply with any of these covenants, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements. Under certain circumstances, the occurrence of an event of default under one of these agreements (or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of these agreements) may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt agreements. Default under our debt agreements could result in, among other things, us no longer being entitled to borrow under one or more of the agreements, acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements, and/or foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreements. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, or if we are unable to comply with our financial or other debt covenants, and our indebtedness becomes immediately due and payable, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure (including through bankruptcy proceedings), or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though any amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2016, we had $21.6 million of available capacity under our revolving line of credit and $22.5 million outstanding under the term loan provided by the Credit Agreement. In addition, we may determine to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of variable for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk and could be subject to credit risk themselves.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022 recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022 news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022 perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022 new technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022 changes in government regulations.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nOur common stock is controlled by insiders, who currently own, in the aggregate, approximately 60% of our outstanding shares of common stock and, as a result, are able to exert significant control over matters submitted to our board and stockholders for approval.\nOur officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 60% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As such, our insiders are able to significantly influence or even unilaterally approve matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, certain decisions relating to our capital structure, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders and investors may have no effective voice in the management of our company.\nIf equity research analysts publish unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be affected by equity research analysts\u2019 research or reports about us and our business. The price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business. In addition, if any of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, up to the 100,000,000 shares of voting common stock authorized by our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which could be increased by a vote of a majority of our shares. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our common stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, amounts of our common stock in the public market after the contractual lock-up and other legal restrictions on resale lapse, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of December 31, 2016, 7,454,491 shares of common stock were outstanding. Of these shares, approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock were freely tradable.\nOur directors, officers and holders of greater than 10% of our outstanding common stock are subject to a contractual lock-up agreement that prevents them from selling their securities prior to June 15, 2017, except that 1347 Investors LLC, one of our significant stockholders, may sell up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of our common stock, subject to applicable securities laws. These lock-up agreements were entered into in connection with our public offering of common stock completed in December 2016. The underwriters involved in that transaction may, in their sole discretion, permit securities subject to the lock-up agreements to be sold prior to its expiration.\nAfter the market stand-offs and lock-up agreements pertaining to that transaction expire, our directors, executive officers and other affiliates may sell a significant number of shares of our common stock into the market, subject to the availability of and volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various contractual agreements.\nIn addition, we are obligated under a registration rights agreement pursuant to file a registration statement to register the resale of a substantial number of shares held by certain of our existing stockholders, as well as to cooperate in certain public offerings of such shares. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration, except for shares purchased or subscribed for by affiliates. As such, upon registration of such shares, a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold in the public market, which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe also may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us in a transaction perceived to be favorable to our stockholders or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur board has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as described in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. The JOBS Act also permits an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, which we intend to take advantage of.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2019, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on the exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including all documents incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company and represents our expectations and beliefs concerning future events.
