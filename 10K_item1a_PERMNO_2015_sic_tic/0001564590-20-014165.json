{"cik": "1095981", "company": "PLUS THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risk factors described below, as well as statements described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d, or in other SEC filings, describe risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could also cause the trading price of our equity securities to decline. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred losses since inception, we expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future and we may never become profitable.\nWe generated negative cash flows from operations and have incurred net operating losses each year since we started business. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred net losses of $10.9 million and our net cash used in operating activities was $5.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $425.3 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for at least the next year. As our focus on development of Nanomedicine and the development of therapeutic applications has increased, losses have resulted primarily from expenses associated with research and development and clinical trial-related activities, as well as general and administrative expenses. While we have implemented and continue to implement cost reduction measures where possible, we nonetheless expect to continue operating in a loss position on a consolidated basis and expect that recurring operating expenses will be at higher levels for the year ended December 31, 2020 as we prepare for and perform clinical trial and other development activities for our Nanomedicine product candidates.\nOur ability to generate sufficient revenues from any of our products, product candidates or technologies to achieve profitability will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture, test and validate our product candidates in compliance with applicable laws and as required for submission to applicable regulatory bodies, including manufacturing, testing and validation of our DocePLUS and DoxoPLUS product candidates;\n\u2022\nour or our partners\u2019 ability to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour or our partners\u2019 ability to negotiate and receive favorable reimbursement for our product candidates, including for our product candidates that have been granted or may be granted orphan drug status or otherwise command currently anticipated pricing levels;\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate favorable arrangements with third parties to help finance the development of, and market and distribute, our products and product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe degree to which our approved products are accepted in the marketplace.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization and product development efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when or if we will become profitable and it is possible we will never become profitable. If we do not generate significant sales from any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects which could result in our inability to continue operations.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to develop our products and for our future operations. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to do so, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate our product development activities or may be unable to continue our business.\nWe have had, and we will continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to continue funding our operations, including our continuing substantial research and development expenses. We do not currently believe that our cash balance will be sufficient to fund the development and marketing efforts required to reach profitability without raising additional capital from accessible sources of financing in the near future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to raise capital to fund our operations on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u2022\nour perceived capital needs with respect to our development programs, and any delays in, adverse events and excessive costs of such programs beyond what we currently anticipate;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborative and other arrangements with third parties to assist in bringing our products to market and the cost of such arrangements at the time;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with operating at our San Antonio, Texas facility;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates, including compliance with good manufacturing practices applicable to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities for product candidates awaiting approval or products that have been approved;\n\u2022\nthe level of our sales and marketing expenses;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce and sell new products.\nWe will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations. Our financing plans include pursuing additional cash through the use of debt and/or equity offering programs, strategic corporate partnerships, state and federal development programs, licensing and sales of assets and equity. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of its clinical development efforts.\nWe have secured capital historically from grant revenues, collaboration proceeds, and debt and equity offerings. To obtain additional capital, we may pursue debt and/or equity offering programs, strategic corporate partnerships, state and federal development programs, licensing arrangements, and sales of assets or debt or equity securities. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise any such additional capital, we may be required to take actions that could materially and adversely harm our business, including a possible significant reduction in our research, development and administrative operations (including reduction of our employee base), the surrender of our rights to some technologies or product opportunities, delay of our clinical trials or regulatory and reimbursement efforts, or curtailment or cessation of operations.\nFailure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.\nOur level of indebtedness, and covenant restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nUnder the Loan and Security Agreement, Oxford made a term loan to us in an aggregate principal amount of $17.7 million (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $11.1 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Term Loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate (with a floor of 1.00%) plus 7.95% per annum. On March 29, 2020, we and Oxford amended the Loan and Security Agreement to extend the interest-only period. Beginning May 1, 2021, we will be required to make payments of principal and accrued interest in equal monthly installments to amortize the Term Loan through June 1, 2024, the new maturity date.\nAs security for our obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement, we granted a security interest in substantially all of our existing and after-acquired assets, excluding our intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement. If we are unable to discharge these obligations, Oxford could foreclose on these assets, which would, at a minimum, have a severe material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nOur indebtedness to Oxford could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things:\n\u2022\ncausing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures and other business activities;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, requires us to maintain at least $2.0 million in unrestricted cash and/or cash equivalents and includes certain reporting and other covenants, that, among other things, restrict our ability to (i) dispose of assets, (ii) change the business we conduct, (iii) make acquisitions, (iv) engage in mergers or consolidations, (v) incur additional indebtedness, (vi) create liens on assets, (vii) maintain any collateral account, (viii) pay dividends, (ix) make investments, loans or advances, (x) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and (xi) prepay certain other indebtedness or amend other financing arrangements. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions, such failure may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in Oxford causing the outstanding loan amount to become immediately due and payable. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have, or be able to timely procure, sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations, and such acceleration would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains an emphasis paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nThe audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm covering the December 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph that states that our recurring losses from operations, liquidity position, and debt service requirements raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This going concern opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt or equity securities or otherwise. Future reports on our financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, our operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital and gross profits. We have had, and we will likely continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our future operations. However, no assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise any such additional capital, we may be required to take actions that could materially and adversely harm our business, including a possible significant reduction in our research, development and administrative operations (including reduction of our employee base), the surrender of our rights to some technologies or product opportunities, delay of our clinical trials or regulatory and reimbursement efforts, or the curtailment or cessation of operations. We also cannot give assurance that we will achieve sufficient revenues in the future to achieve profitability and cash flow positive operations to allow us to continue as a going concern. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause third parties to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to access the full amounts available under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, which could prevent us from accessing the capital we need to continue our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn September 2018, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \u201cLincoln Park Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) pursuant to which we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $5.0 million in shares of our common stock from time to time over the 24-month period following October 15, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Thereafter, on any trading day selected by us, we may sell shares of common stock to Lincoln Park in amounts up to 5,000 shares per regular sale (such purchases, Regular Purchases) up to the aggregate commitment of $5.0 million. The amount we may sell to Lincoln Park under a single Regular Purchase may increase under certain circumstances as described in the Purchase Agreement but in no event will the amount of a single Regular Purchase exceed $1.0 million. The purchase price of shares of common stock related to the Regular Purchases will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales. We may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase other amounts as accelerated purchases or additional accelerated purchases if the closing sale price of the common stock is not below the threshold prices as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. There are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Purchase Agreement. There is no upper limit on the price per share that Lincoln Park must pay for common stock under a Regular Purchase or an accelerated purchase and in no event will shares be sold to Lincoln Park on a day our closing price is less than the floor price as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.\nDepending on the prevailing market price of our common stock, we may not be able to sell shares to Lincoln Park for the maximum $5.0 million over the term of the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. For example, under the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may be restricted in our ability to issue more than 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock (which is approximately 775,729 shares based on 3,880,588 shares outstanding as of March 20, 2020) unless we obtain stockholder approval or we obtain an exception pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market to issue more than 19.99%. We are not required or permitted to issue any shares of common stock under the Purchase Agreement if such issuance would breach our obligations under the rules or regulations of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, Lincoln Park will not be required to purchase any shares of our common stock if such sale would result in Lincoln Park\u2019s beneficial ownership exceeding 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. Our inability to access a portion or the full amount available under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, in the absence of any other financing sources, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the resale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nDepending on market liquidity at the time, sales of shares under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. We generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. Whether or not we make sales of our common stock, if any, under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of the shares it purchases from us under this agreement. Sales of our common stock under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future research and development activities. We may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected events. Accordingly, unexpected events could have an immediate and material impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur operating results have been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nOur prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies and particularly by such companies in rapidly evolving and technologically advanced biotech, pharmaceutical and medical device fields. From time to time, we have tried to update our investors\u2019 expectations as to our operating results by periodically announcing financial guidance. However, we have in the past been forced to revise or withdraw such guidance due to lack of visibility and predictability of product demand. If we revise or withdraw guidance, it could materially harm our reputation and the market\u2019s perception of us, and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe do not expect to make profits in the near future. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income and taxes may be limited. We may have experienced, or may in the future experience, \u201cownership changes\u201d as a result of shifts in stock ownership. Any such ownership changes could limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes. Furthermore, under 2017 U.S. tax legislation, although the treatment of tax losses generated before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in calendar year 2018 and beyond may be used to offset only 80% of taxable income. This change may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur future success is in large part dependent upon our ability to successfully integrate and develop our Nanomedicine platform and commercialize DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS and any failure to do so could significantly harm our business and prospects.\nOur ability to successfully integrate, develop and commercialize DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe do not have substantive drug development, manufacturing, and commercialization experience, and thus we may be required to hire and rely on significant numbers of scientific, quality, regulatory and other technical personnel with the experience and expertise necessary to develop, manufacture, and commercialize our Plus Therapeutics Nanomedicine product candidates. We may be unable to identify, hire and retain personnel with the requisite experience to conduct the operations necessary to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS product candidates, in which case our business would be materially harmed;\n\u2022\nwe intend to find a commercialization partner to share or assume responsibility for marketing, sales, and distribution activities and related costs and expenses for our DocePLUS product candidate. There can be no assurance that we would obtain sufficient capital to fund the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our Nanomedicine program ourselves, or if we do obtain such capital, that our development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts would be successful;\n\u2022\nconduct of this acquired business will require significant capital, and to the extent that we incur unanticipated expenses in our business, are unable to timely obtain sufficient additional capital on terms acceptable to us (or at all) to fund this business, our ability to develop our DocePLUS product candidate could be materially and adversely impacted;\n\u2022\nwe have discontinued development activities for DoxoPLUS and are actively seeking to monetize this asset. New competitive products become commercially available before we launch DocePLUS; and\n\u2022\nwe are not experienced in acquiring and integrating new businesses.\nIf we are unable to successfully partner with other companies to commercialize our product candidates, our business could materially suffer.\nA key part of our business strategy is to leverage strategic partnerships/collaborations to commercialize our product candidates. We do not have the financial, human or other resources necessary to develop, commercialize, launch or sell our therapeutic offerings in all of the geographies that we are targeting, and thus it is important that we identify and partner with third parties who possess the necessary resources to bring our products to market. We expect that any such partners will provide regulatory and reimbursement/pricing expertise, sales and marketing resources, and other expertise and resources vital to the success of our product offerings in their territories. We further expect, but cannot guarantee, that any such partnering arrangements will include upfront cash payments to us in return for the rights to develop, manufacture, and/or sell our products in specified territories, as well as downstream revenues in the form of milestone payments and royalties.\nOur current business strategy is high-risk.\nOur current business strategy is to aggressively develop our Nanomedicine platforms, while simultaneously controlling expenses, which is a high-risk strategy for a number of reasons including the following:\n\u2022\nwe do not have an operating history as a drug company, or prior experience with obtaining regulatory, reimbursement or other approvals for product candidates such as DocePLUS;\n\u2022\nour Nanomedicine product candidates, if commercialized, will compete against established competitive drugs that are marketed and sold by large companies with significant human, technical and financial resources;\n\u2022\nwe are not experienced in acquiring and integrating new assets;\n\u2022\nthere is an intense and rapidly evolving competitive landscape for our Nanomedicine product candidates, including chemotherapies, targeted therapies and immuno-oncology therapies, and as such key assumptions regarding market entry, pricing, and revenue/unit share may not be realized;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may never become commercially viable; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by selling products based on our intellectual property and developments.\nWe face intense competition, and if our competitors market and/or develop products that are marketed more effectively, approved more quickly than our product candidates or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our products, our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated.\nThe life science industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our products or product candidates, including small and large, domestic and multinational, medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well-established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than we do.\nWe expect that product candidates in our pipeline, if approved, to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. One or more of our competitors may develop other products that compete with ours, obtain necessary approvals for such products from the FDA, EMA, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare or other agencies, if required, more rapidly than we do or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than any products developed by us. The competition that we encounter with respect to any of our product candidates that receive the requisite regulatory approval and classification and are marketed may have an effect on our product prices, market share and results of operations. We may not be able to differentiate any products that we are able to market from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better results than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. In addition, competitors may seek to develop alternative formulations of or technological approaches to our product candidates and/or drug delivery technologies that address our targeted indications.\nWe may face competition for our DocePLUS product candidate (which is intended for the treatment of small cell lung cancer) from multiple drug classes.\nCompanies that are developing or have commercialized nanoparticle-docetaxel products, including both oral and intravenous formulations, and may be future competitors for our DocePLUS product candidate include, but are not limited to, Adocia, Athenex, Bind Therapeutics, Cerulean, Cristal Therapeutics, Intas, LIDDS, Merrimack, Modra, NanOlogy, Oasmia, and Starpharma.\nCompetitors may have greater experience in developing drugs, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, manufacturing and commercialization. It is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection, approval, or clearance from the FDA or achieve commercialization earlier than we can, any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022\ncapital resources;\n\u2022\nresearch and development resources and experience, including personnel and experience;\n\u2022\nproduct development, clinical trial and regulatory resources and experience;\n\u2022\nsales and marketing resources and experience;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and distribution resources and experience;\n\u2022\nname, brand and product recognition; and\n\u2022\nresources, experience and expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more quickly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit or block us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed or accepted or less costly than ours and may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively with the marketed therapeutics of our competitors or if such competitors are successful in developing products that compete with any of our product candidates that are approved, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety and efficacy for our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval and commercialization, which would have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nClinical testing of our product candidates is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and the failure or delay of a clinical trial can occur at any stage. Many factors, currently known and unknown, can adversely affect clinical trials and the ability to evaluate a product candidate\u2019s efficacy. During the course of treatment, patients can die or suffer other adverse events for reasons that may or may not be related to the proposed product being tested. Even if initial results of preclinical and nonclinical studies or clinical trial results are promising, we may obtain different results in subsequent trials or studies that fail to show the desired levels of safety and efficacy, or we may not obtain applicable regulatory approval for a variety of other reasons.\nFurther, with respect to the conduct and results of clinical trials generally, in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions, the conduct and results of clinical trials can be delayed, limited suspended, or otherwise adversely affected for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nclinical results may not meet prescribed endpoints for the studies or otherwise provide sufficient data to support the efficacy of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nclinical and nonclinical test results may reveal side effects, adverse events or unexpected safety issues associated with the use of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our contract research organizations, and other third parties;\n\u2022\ninability to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulatory review may not find a product safe or effective enough to merit either continued testing or final approval;\n\u2022\nregulatory review may not find that the data from preclinical testing and clinical trials justifies approval;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require that we change our studies or conduct additional studies which may significantly delay or make continued pursuit of approval commercially unattractive;\n\u2022\na regulatory agency may reject our trial data or disagree with our interpretations of either clinical trial data or applicable regulations;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials required for product approval may be greater than what we originally anticipate, and we may decide to not pursue regulatory approval for such a product;\n\u2022\na regulatory agency may identify problems or other deficiencies in our existing manufacturing processes or facilities or the existing processes or facilities of our collaborators, our contract manufacturers or our raw material suppliers;\n\u2022\na regulatory agency may change its formal or informal approval requirements and policies, act contrary to previous guidance, adopt new regulations or raise new issues or concerns late in the approval process;\n\u2022\na product candidate may be approved only for indications that are narrow or under conditions that place the product at a competitive disadvantage, which may limit the sales and marketing activities for such products or otherwise adversely impact the commercial potential of a product; and\n\u2022\na regulatory agency may ask us to put a clinical study on hold pending additional safety data (and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the regulator agencies\u2019 requests in a timely manner, which can lead to significant uncertainty in the completion of a clinical study).\nWe also face clinical trial-related risks with regard to our reliance on other third parties in the performance of many of the clinical trial functions, including contract research organizations, that help execute our clinical trials, the hospitals and clinics at which our trials are conducted, the clinical investigators at the trial sites, and other third-party service providers. Failure of any third-party service provider to adhere to applicable trial protocols, laws and regulations in the conduct of one of our clinical trials could adversely affect the conduct and results of such trial (including possible data integrity issues), which could seriously harm our business.\nOur success depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our DocePLUS product candidate. However, we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approval for this product candidate or our other product candidates.\nWe have only a limited number of product candidates in development, and our business depends substantially on their successful development and commercialization. Our product candidates will require development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenues from sales of our product candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, whose regulations differ from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the regulatory authorities of such countries (including centralized marketing authorization from EMA), and we may never receive such regulatory approvals. Obtaining regulatory approval for a product candidate is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and may not be obtained. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates would limit our ability to generate future revenues (and any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenue), would potentially harm the development prospects of our product candidates and would have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nEven if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, on our ability to commercialize such products as well as the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets for our product candidates are not as significant as we estimate, our business and prospects will be harmed.\nIf a product candidate is not approved in a timely fashion on commercially viable terms, or if development of any product candidate is terminated due to difficulties or delays encountered in the regulatory approval process, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, and we may become more dependent on the development of other proprietary products and/or our ability to successfully acquire other products and technologies. There can be no assurance that any product candidate will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all.\nIf our product candidates and technologies receive regulatory approval but do not achieve broad market acceptance, especially by physicians, the revenues that we generate will be limited.\nThe commercial success of any of our approved products or technologies will depend upon the acceptance of these products and technologies by physicians, patients and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of these products and technologies will depend on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nany negative publicity or political action related to our or our competitors\u2019 products or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\ndemonstration to authorities of the pharmacoeconomic benefits;\n\u2022\ndemonstration to authorities of the improvement in burden of illness;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\npayers\u2019 level of restrictions and/or barriers to coverage;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which a product is approved;\n\u2022\navailability and perceived advantages of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or future collaborators\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution strategies; and\n\u2022\npricing and cost effectiveness.\nOur DocePLUS product candidate, if developed and commercialized, would compete against a number of established drugs, including Taxotere\u00ae (docetaxel) (Sanofi S.A.) and Hycamtin\u00ae (topotecan) (Novartis), as well as other products being developed and commercialized by competitors for the same target clinical indication.\nWe expect physicians\u2019 inertia and skepticism to also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products. We believe we will continue to need to finance lengthy time-consuming clinical studies to provide evidence of the medical benefit of our products and resulting therapies in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism.\nOverall, our efforts to educate the medical community on the benefits of any of our products or technologies for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities and gain broad market acceptance may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our products and technologies do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, pharmacists and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products to become or remain profitable.\nAll potential applications of our product candidates are pre-commercial, which subjects us to development and marketing risks.\nOur product candidates are at various stages of development. Successful development and market acceptance of our products is subject to developmental risks, including risk of negative clinical data from current and anticipated trials, failure of inventive imagination, ineffectiveness, lack of safety, unreliability, manufacturing hurdles, failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances or approvals, high commercial cost, preclusion or obsolescence resulting from third parties\u2019 proprietary rights or superior or equivalent products, competition from copycat products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns. There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates, or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or superior. Failure to successfully develop and market our product candidates would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or any party to a key collaboration, licensing, development, acquisition or similar arrangement fails to perform material obligations under such arrangement, or any arrangement is terminated for any reason, there could be an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are currently party to certain licensing, collaboration and acquisition agreements under which we may make or receive future payments in the form of milestone payments, maintenance fees, royalties and/or minimum product purchases. Our collaborators may not devote the attention and resources to such efforts to be successful. The termination of a key collaboration agreement by one of our collaborators could materially impact our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements with new collaborators on favorable terms.\nIn February 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Azaya Therapeutics Inc (\u201cAzaya\u201d), including DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS, and related manufacturing equipment and inventory pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cAzaya Purchase Agreement\u201d). Under the Azaya Purchase Agreement, we are required to use commercial reasonable efforts to develop our DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS product candidates. Further, we are subject to future milestone, earn-out and other payments to Azaya all of which are tied to our commercialization and sale activities for these product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to develop our DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS drug assets, or if Azaya and we were to enter into a dispute over the terms of our agreement, then our business could be seriously harmed.\nOn March 29, 2020, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with NanoTx, Corp. (\u201cNanoTx\u201d) for the global rights to develop and commercialize NanoTx\u2019s glioblastoma treatment. Under the license agreement with NanoTx, we are required to use commercial reasonable efforts to develop the assets acquired under the license agreement. Further, we are subject to future milestone, earn-out and other payments to NanoTx all of which are tied to our commercialization and sale activities for product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to develop these assets, or if NanoTx and we were to enter into a dispute over the terms of our agreement, then our business could be seriously harmed.\nIf we or collaborators fail to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to the development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products, regulatory agencies may take action against us or them, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur product candidates, along with the clinical development process, the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for these products, are subject to continual requirements and review by the FDA and state and foreign regulatory bodies. Regulatory authorities subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. We, our collaborators, and our and their respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including complying with regulations and laws regarding advertising,\npromotion and sales of products, required submissions of safety and other post-market information and reports, registration requirements, Clinical Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations (including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation), and the requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping requirements. Regulatory agencies may change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We, our collaborators, and our and their respective contractors, suppliers and vendors, may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in any of the following:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our products or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination of any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure;\n\u2022\ninjunctions; or\n\u2022\nimposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, and the requirements to obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions can be costly, time-consuming and unpredictable. If we or our partners are unable to obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business may be substantially harmed.\nThe worldwide regulatory process for our Nanomedicine drug candidates can be lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of approval.\nBefore any new drugs may be introduced to the U.S. market, the manufacturer generally must obtain FDA approval through either an ANDA process for generic drugs off patent that allow for bioequivalence to an existing RLD or the lengthier NDA process, which typically requires multiple successful and successive clinical trials to generate clinical data supportive of safety and efficacy along with extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic preclinical testing to demonstrate safety. DocePLUS is subject to the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) NDA process. NDA drugs can take significant time due to the preclinical and clinical trial requirements.\nThere are numerous risks arising out of the regulation of our Nanomedicine product candidates include the following:\n\u2022\nwe can provide no assurances that our current and future oncology drugs will meet all of the stringent government regulation in the United States, by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and/or in international markets such as Europe, by the EMA under its Medicinal Products Directive;\n\u2022\nour Nanomedicine product candidates, if approved, will still be subject to post-market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the drug may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury, or serious adverse events;\n\u2022\nthere are no assurances that our product candidates will not have safety or effectiveness problems occurring after the drugs reach the market;\n\u2022\nthere are no assurances that regulatory authorities will not take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the drug due to safety concerns; and\n\u2022\nit is possible that the new legislation in our priority markets will yield additional regulatory requirements for therapeutic drugs for our Nanomedicine product candidates.\nChanging, new and/or emerging government regulations may adversely affect us.\nAny regulatory review committees and advisory groups and any contemplated new guidelines may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we may be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a product candidate to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient revenue to maintain our business. Divergence in regulatory criteria for different regulatory agencies around the globe could result in the repeat of clinical studies and/or preclinical studies to satisfy local territory requirements, resulting in the repeating of studies and/or delays in the regulatory process. Some territories may require clinical data in their indigenous population, resulting in the repeat of clinical studies in whole or in part. Some territories may object to the formulation ingredients in the final finished product and may require reformulation to modify or remove objectionable\ncomponents; resulting in delays in regulatory approvals. Such objectionable reformulations include, but are not limited to, human or animal components, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and/or Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy risks, banned packaging components, prohibited chemicals, banned substances, etc. There can be no assurances that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will accept our pre-clinical and/or clinical data.\nAnticipated or unanticipated changes in the way or manner in which the FDA or other regulators regulate products or classes/groups of products can delay, further burden, or alleviate regulatory pathways that were once available to other products. There are no guarantees that such changes in the FDA\u2019s or other regulators\u2019 approach to the regulatory process will not deleteriously affect some or all of our products or product applications.\nOur nanoparticle technology and pipeline oncology products, such as DocePLUS, are being developed under existing government criteria, which are subject to change in the future. Clinical and/or pre-clinical criteria in addition to cGMP manufacturing requirements may change and impose additional regulatory burdens. Clinical requirements are subject to change which may result in delays in completing the regulatory process. Divergence in regulatory criteria for different regulatory agencies around the globe could result in the repeat of clinical studies and/or preclinical studies to satisfy local jurisdictional requirements, which would significantly lengthen the regulatory process and increase uncertainty of outcome. Some jurisdictions may require clinical data in their indigenous population, resulting in the repeat of clinical studies in whole or in part. Some jurisdictions may object to the formulation ingredients in the final finished product and may require reformulation to modify or remove objectionable components; resulting in delays in regulatory approvals. Such objectionable reformulations include, but are not limited to, human or animal components, bovine spongiform encephalopathy/ transmissible spongiform encephalopathy risks, banned packaging components, prohibited chemicals, banned substances, etc. There can be no assurance that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will accept our pre-clinical and/or clinical data.\nOrphan drug designation may not ensure that we will enjoy market exclusivity in a particular market, and if we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or other regulatory exclusivity for some of our product candidates, our competitive position would be harmed.\nA product candidate that receives orphan drug designation can benefit from potential commercial benefits following approval. Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as affecting a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 10,000 persons in the European Union. Currently, this designation provides market exclusivity in the U.S. and the European Union for seven years and ten years, respectively, if a product is the first such product approved for such orphan indication. This market exclusivity does not, however, pertain to indications other than those for which the drug was specifically designated in the approval, nor does it prevent other types of drugs from receiving orphan designations or approvals in these same indications. Further, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a drug with similar chemical structure for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the new drug is clinically superior to the orphan product or a market shortage occurs. In the European Union, orphan exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the drug no longer satisfies the original designation criteria or can be lost altogether if the marketing authorization holder consents to a second orphan drug application or cannot supply enough drug, or when a second applicant demonstrates its drug is \u201cclinically superior\u201d to the original orphan drug.\nIf we experience an interruption in supply from a material sole source supplier, our business may be harmed\nWe acquire some of our components and other raw materials from sole source suppliers. If there is an interruption in supply of our raw materials from a sole source supplier, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate quantities of the raw materials within a reasonable time or at commercially reasonable prices. Interruptions in supplies due to pricing, timing, availability or other issues with our sole source suppliers could have a negative impact on our ability to manufacture products and product candidates, which in turn could adversely affect the development and commercialization of our Nanomedicine product candidates and cause us to potentially breach our supply or other obligations under our agreements with certain other counterparties.\nWe are dependent on sole source suppliers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and certain other components of our Nanomedicine product candidates. There are no assurances that these sole source suppliers will enter into supply agreements with us to provide contractual assurance to us around supply and pricing. Regardless whether a sole source supplier enters into a written supply arrangement with us, such supplier could still delay, suspend or terminate supply of raw materials to us for a number of reasons, including manufacturing or quality issues, payment disputes with us, bankruptcy or insolvency, or other occurrences.\nIf a sole source supplier ceases supply of raw materials necessary there is no guarantee that we will find an alternative supplier for the necessary raw materials on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further the qualification process for a new vendor could take months or even years, and any such day in qualification could significantly harm our business.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Growth of the Nanomedicine business will require significant management time and attention. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any additional transactions of the nature described above, any additional transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe must maintain quality assurance certification and manufacturing approvals.\nThe manufacture of our products is, and the manufacture of any future drug and/or cell-related therapeutic products would be, subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and distribution partners. The manufacture of drugs and devices products for human use is subject to regulation and inspection from time to time by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP, Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSRs\u201d), as well as equivalent requirements and inspections by state and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. There can be no assurance that the FDA or other authorities will not, during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities, identify what they consider to be deficiencies in our compliance with QSRs or other requirements and request, or seek remedial action.\nFailure to comply with such regulations or a potential delay in attaining compliance may adversely affect our manufacturing activities and could result in, among other things, injunctions, civil penalties, FDA refusal to grant pre- market approvals or clearances of future or pending product submissions, fines, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production and criminal prosecution. There can be no assurance that after such occurrences that we will be able to obtain additional necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances, or the loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to identify, hire and/or retain key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nWe maintain a very small executive team. Our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled and qualified research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial and financial personnel. We compete for talent with numerous companies, as well as universities and non-profit research organizations. In the future, we may hire a significant number of scientists, quality and regulatory personnel, and other technical staff with the requisite expertise to support and expand our Nanomedicine business. The manufacturing of our oncology drug assets is a highly complex process that requires significant experience and know-how. If we are unable to attract personnel with the necessary skills and experience to reestablish and expand our Nanomedicine business, which is currently conducted out of our San Antonio, Texas facility, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success also depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff to provide strategic direction, manage our operations, and maintain a cohesive and stable environment. In particular, we are highly dependent on our executive officers, especially Marc Hedrick, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer. Given his leadership, extensive technical, scientific and financial expertise and management and operational experience, Dr. Hedrick would be difficult to replace. Consequently, the loss of services of Dr. Hedrick or any other executive officer could result in product development delays or the failure of our collaborations with current and future collaborators, which, in turn, may hurt our ability to develop and commercialize products and generate revenues. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of the members of our senior management. The loss of key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire, retain, and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business.\nOur restructuring activities may not be successful, and our restructuring activities may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention, our stock price and our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn July 1, 2019, we announced a corporate restructuring, including reducing combined staffing in our Texas and California facilities by 46% overall, reducing our office space in San Diego, California and streamlining and outsourcing our operations to better focus on our drug pipeline, and in particular DocePLUS, in order to extend our cash resources. As a result, we expect to incur a restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 million in connection with one-time employee termination costs, including severance and other benefits, which costs primarily incurred in the third quarter of 2019. We are not yet able to make a determination of each other major type of cost associated with the restructuring. The estimates of costs that we expect to incur and the timing thereof are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ from initial estimates.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits, including the anticipated cost savings, of our restructuring activities within expected timeframes is subject to many estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Additional restructuring or reorganization activities may also be required in the future, which could further increase the risks associated with these activities. There is no assurance that we will successfully implement, or fully realize the anticipated impact of, our restructuring or execute successfully on our restructuring plan, in the timeframes we desire or at all. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from these measures, or if we incur charges or costs in amounts that are greater than anticipated, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, our restructuring efforts, including a significant reduction in our employee headcount, may disrupt our staff and our business, and we may not be successful, or as successful, in advancing our existing Nanomedicine candidates, or in discovering or developing new Nanomedicine candidates as a result of lower staffing levels and potential reductions in our spending on these programs due to the restructuring.\nThe changes and potential changes to our operations and the workforce reduction measures as a result of the restructuring, may introduce uncertainty regarding our prospects and may result in disruption of our business. As a result of these actions, we incurred significant expenses and charges, including the approximately $570,000 charge incurred as a result of restructuring and cancelation of our San Diego headquarters lease announced on February 2018, and we may incur additional expenses and charges related to these actions. In addition, these changes and measures could distract our employees, decrease employee morale and make it more difficult to retain and hire new talent, and harm our reputation. These changes and activities caused our stock price to decline and may cause it to further decline in the future. As a result of these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nThe clinical use of our product candidates exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk exists even if a product or product candidate is approved for commercial sale by applicable regulatory authorities and manufactured in facilities regulated by such authorities. Our product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. For example, DoxoPLUS is cytotoxic, or toxic to living cells, and, if incorrectly or defectively manufactured or labeled, or incorrectly dosed or otherwise used in a manner not contemplated by its label, could result in patient harm and even death. In addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury.\nProduct liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or product candidates, if approved, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022\nloss of revenues.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for clinical trials with a $10 million per occurrence and annual aggregate coverage limit. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage, we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nA failure to adequately protect private health information could result in severe harm to our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThroughout the clinical trial process, we may obtain the private health information of our trial subjects. There are a number of state, federal and international laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d), Congress amended the privacy and security provisions of the Healthcare Information Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). HIPAA imposes limitations on the use and disclosure of an individual\u2019s healthcare information by healthcare providers conducting certain electronic transactions, healthcare clearinghouses, and health insurance plans, collectively referred to as covered entities. The HIPAA amendments also impose compliance obligations and corresponding penalties for non-compliance on certain individuals and entities that provide services to or perform certain functions on behalf of healthcare providers and other covered entities involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, collectively referred to as business associates. ARRA also made significant increases in the penalties for improper use or disclosure of an individual\u2019s health information under HIPAA and extended enforcement authority to state attorneys general. The amendments also create notification requirements to federal regulators, and in some cases local and national media, for individuals whose health information has been inappropriately accessed or disclosed. Notification is not required under HIPAA if the health information that is improperly used or disclosed is deemed secured in accordance with certain encryption or other standards developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d). Most states have laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory contractual terms to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the U.S. implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. The European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, Canada\u2019s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and other data protection, privacy and similar national, state/provincial and local laws may also restrict the access, use and disclosure of patient health information abroad. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nWe and our collaborators must comply with environmental laws and regulations, including those pertaining to use of hazardous and biological materials in our business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe and our collaborators are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, those relating to manufacturing, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, and those relating to the health and safety of employees with respect to laboratory activities required for the development of our products and activities. In particular, our Nanomedicine products and processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of certain cytotoxic, or toxic to living cells, materials. Even if we and these suppliers and collaborators comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials, or other violations of applicable environmental laws, rules or regulations cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any violation of such laws, rules or regulations, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of any insurance we may obtain and could exceed our financial resources. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We may incur significant costs in complying with environmental laws, rules and regulations.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products.\nIncreased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee refreshers, monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) and on March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom submitted a formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As a result, the United Kingdom ceased to be a member state of the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period will apply until the end of 2020 (or later, if extended) during which the pre-Brexit legal regime will continue to apply (including with respect to aviation) while the United Kingdom and European Union negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, it is expected that the United Kingdom\u2019s regulatory regime will remain aligned to European Union regulations. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. In the longer term, Brexit could materially impact us in the commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom. In the short term, there is a risk of incremental costs and delays related to the marketing authorization and regulatory processes.\nWe may face business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur development programs could be disrupted and materially adversely affected by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. As a result of measures imposed by the governments in affected regions, many commercial activities, businesses and schools have been suspended as part of quarantines and other measures intended to contain this outbreak. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern,\u201d and the World Health Organization characterizing COVID-19 as a pandemic. While the COVID-19 outbreak may still be in early stages, international stock markets have begun to reflect the uncertainty associated with the potential economic impact of the outbreak and the significant declines in the Dow Industrial Average at the end of February and in March 2020 has been largely attributed to the effects of COVID-19. We are still assessing the potential impact COVID-19 may have on our ability to effectively conduct our commercialization efforts and development programs and otherwise conduct our business operations as planned, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-019 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our industry and business in particular.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and technology, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our platform technology and current product candidates, including but not limited to our Nanomedicine product candidates, including DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS, as well as successfully defending our intellectual property against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making using selling, offering to sell or importing our platform technology and/or our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nwe, or Azaya, as the case may be, might not have been the first to file patent applications for the covered inventions;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are dominating patents to our products of which we are not aware;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our patents, of which we are not aware;\n\u2022\nit is possible that others may circumvent our patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our products or technology similar to ours;\n\u2022\nthe claims of our patents or patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our system or products, or our system or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour owned or in-licensed issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be narrowed in scope, be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal administrative challenges by third parties;\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make or use compounds that are the same or similar to the DocePLUS product but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to detect infringement against our patents, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents, such as the patents/applications related to DocePLUS;\n\u2022\nthe API in DoxoPLUS and DocePLUS are commercially available in generic drug products;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies for which we can obtain patent protection; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents in these fields has emerged to date in the United States. There have been recent changes regarding how patent laws are interpreted, and both the USPTO and Congress have recently made significant changes to the patent system. There have been three U.S. Supreme Court decisions that now show a trend of the Supreme Court which is distinctly negative on patents. The trend of these decisions along with resulting changes in patentability requirements being implemented by the USPTO could make it increasingly difficult for us to obtain and maintain patents on our products. We cannot accurately predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws which might be enacted into law. Those changes may materially affect our patents, our ability to obtain patents and/or the patents and applications of our collaborators and licensors. The patent situation in these fields outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents we own or to which we have a license or third-party patents.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors\u2019 patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to obtain or maintain patent protection or protect trade secrets, for any reason (or third-party claims against our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, or our involvement in disputes over our patents, trade secrets, or proprietary rights, including involvement in litigation), could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our trade secrets.\nWe may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially with respect to the Nanomedicine products, as well as in areas where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our collaborators and suppliers. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, state laws in the Unites States vary, and their courts as well as courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If our confidential or proprietary information is divulged to or acquired by third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets could be severely compromised.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights to our products and technology.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights, which would result in substantial costs to us and diversion of effort on our part. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the United States, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any such litigation or interference proceeding, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time-consuming.\nSuccessful challenges to our patents through oppositions, reexamination proceedings or interference proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe the patents of third-parties, we may be subject to litigation, prevented from commercializing potential products in the relevant jurisdiction and/or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCompetitors or third parties may infringe on or upon our patents. We may be required to file patent infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable or that the third party\u2019s technology does not in fact infringe upon our patents. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nLitigation may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries outside the United States where patent rights may be more difficult to enforce. Further, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success will also depend, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing on patents issued by others. There may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware, that are infringed or are alleged to be infringed by our product candidate or proprietary technologies. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents.\nIf a third-party\u2019s patent was found to cover our products, proprietary technologies or their uses, we could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies unless we or they obtained a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies or methods pending a trial on the merits, which could be years away.\nRisks Relating to the Securities Markets and an Investment in Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of clinical trials involving the use of our products, including our sponsored trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the markets we currently serve or which we intend to target with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour continuing ability to list our securities on an established market or exchange;\n\u2022\nthe timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals of our products;\n\u2022\nthe commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by the holders of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the Nasdaq markets may experience a loss of investor confidence. A loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, our financial condition or results of operations, which may materially harm the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our share price.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 3,880,588 shares of our common stock outstanding. Sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public market, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also sell additional common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or other transactions, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have granted demand registration rights for the resale of certain shares of our common stock to each of Astellas Pharma Inc. and Green Hospital Supply, Inc. pursuant to common stock purchase agreements previously entered into with each of these stockholders. An aggregate of approximately 30,000 shares of our common stock are subject to these demand registration rights. If we receive a written request from any of these stockholders to file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, covering its shares of unregistered common stock, we are required to use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC within 30 business days of such request a registration statement covering the resale of the shares for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.\nOur stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nOur charter allows us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock and to issue and designate the rights of, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. To raise additional capital, we may in the future sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that are lower than the prices paid by existing stockholders, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders, which could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe could be delisted from Nasdaq, which would seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital.\nOn August 16, 2019, we received a written notice from Nasdaq staff indicating that we no longer meet the minimum publicly held shares requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4), which requires listed companies to maintain at least 500,000 publicly held shares. On September 11, 2019, we received written notice from Nasdaq staff that, based on having 786,807 publicly held shares outstanding as of August 31, 2019, we had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4).\nHowever, on August 19, 2019, we received a written notice from Nasdaq staff indicating that, based on our stockholders\u2019 deficit of $6.3 million as of June 30, 2019, we no longer meet the alternative compliance standards of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we do not meet the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations. We intend to evaluate various courses of action to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) within the compliance period specified by Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance within such compliance period or, if we regain compliance, that we will not fall out of compliance with one of Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards at some future point in time.\nIf we cease to be eligible to trade on Nasdaq:\n\u2022\nWe may have to pursue trading on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d\n\u2022\nShares of our common stock could be less liquid and marketable, thereby reducing the ability of stockholders to purchase or sell our shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically. If our stock is traded as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d transactions in our stock would be more difficult and cumbersome.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as less attractive investments with higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested in, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock. This may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may be or become the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities, the reporting of unfavorable news or continued decline in a company\u2019s stock price, security holders have often instituted class action litigation. The market value of our securities has steadily declined over the past several years for a variety of reasons discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, which heightens our litigation risk. If we face such litigation, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to suffer. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, guarantees, preferred stock, hybrid securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive distributions of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may be influenced by market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nOur charter documents contain anti-takeover provisions.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our Board of Directors. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue without stockholder approval up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and cannot be taken by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nWe presently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends in the past, and we currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on the common stock in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford currently prohibits our issuance of cash dividends. This could make an investment in our common stock inappropriate for some investors, and may serve to narrow our potential sources of additional capital. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance the future expansion of our business.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThere is currently a limited market for our securities, and any trading market that exists in our securities may be highly illiquid and may not reflect the underlying value of our net assets or business prospects.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there is currently a limited market for our common stock and an active market may never develop. An active trading market in our common stock may not develop.", "PERMNO": 91021, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PSTV"}
