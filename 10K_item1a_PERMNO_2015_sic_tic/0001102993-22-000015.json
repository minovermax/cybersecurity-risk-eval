Risk Factors\nThe following are certain of the important risk factors that could cause, or contribute to causing, our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated, expected, or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, could also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and/or the price of our outstanding securities, and make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\n\u2022Our business depends significantly on our ability to retain our key personnel, attract new personnel, and manage attrition.\n\u2022Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\n\u2022The success of our business depends on retention of existing customers and their purchase of additional services, and attracting new customers and new consumer users of our consumer services.\n\u2022Our expansion into new products, services, and technologies could subject us to additional risks.\n\u2022Major public health issues, and specifically the pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\n\u2022If we do not successfully integrate past or potential future acquisitions, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and our business could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022Capital needs necessary to execute our business strategy could increase substantially and we may not be able to secure additional financing to execute this strategy.\n\u2022Our sales cycles can be lengthy, and the timing of sales can be difficult to predict, which may cause our operating results to vary significantly.\n\u2022Delays in our implementation cycles could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Operating Results\n\u2022Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause a substantial decline in the trading price of our securities.\n\u2022In the past we have experienced losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $516.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and we may incur losses in the future.\n\u2022The non-payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of customers may negatively impact our financial condition or make it difficult to forecast our revenues accurately.\n\u2022Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, declines in business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nRisks Related to Industry Dynamics and Competition\n\u2022If we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with partners, service partners, social media, and other third-party consumer messaging platforms and endpoints, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may lose customers and revenue if we are not able to innovate or effectively compete.\n\u2022Downturns in the global economic environment or in particular industries in which our sales are concentrated may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Security Vulnerabilities and Service Reliability\n\u2022Failures or security breaches in our services or systems, those of our third party service providers, or in the websites of our customers, including those resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities, defects, or errors, could harm our business.\n\u2022We may be liable if third parties access or misappropriate confidential or personal data from our systems or services.\n\u2022We provide service level commitments to certain customers. If we do not meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our reputation.\n\u2022Failure to license necessary third party software for use in our products and services, or failure to successfully integrate third party software, could cause delays or reductions in our sales, or errors or failures of our service.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Data Privacy Issues\n\u2022Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, and increased public scrutiny of privacy and security issues could result in increased government regulation, industry standards, and other legal obligations that could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We may be subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and could subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\n\u2022Industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions could harm our business.\n\u2022Future regulation of the Internet or mobile devices may slow our growth, resulting in decreased demand for our services and increased costs of doing business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\n\u2022Our products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management.\n\u2022Our business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022Issues in the use of AI in our product offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.\nRisks Related to our International Operations and Tax Issues\n\u2022Our results of operations may be adversely impacted due to our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\u2022We may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally and/or into direct-to-consumer services due to additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022Our operations may expose us to greater than anticipated income, non-income, and transactional tax liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\n\u2022Political, economic, and military conditions in Israel could negatively impact our Israeli operations.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes\n\u2022Servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\n\u2022We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\n\u2022Provisions in the indentures for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\n\u2022The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\n\u2022The capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\n\u2022Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, which could reduce the value of your investment and subject us to litigation.\n\u2022Our common stock is traded on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\n\u2022If our officers, directors and largest stockholders choose to act together, they may be able to significantly influence our management and operations, acting in their own best interest and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\n\u2022Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\n\u2022Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\nOur business depends significantly on our ability to retain our key personnel, attract new personnel, and manage attrition.\nOur success depends largely on the continued services of our senior management team. The loss of one or more members of senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of other key personnel, including key sales executives responsible for revenue generation and key development personnel accountable for product and service innovation and timely development and delivery of upgrades and enhancements to our existing products and services. Changes to senior management and key employees could also lead to additional unplanned losses of key employees. The loss of key employees could seriously harm our ability to release new products and services and upgrade existing products and services on a timely basis, and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nIn the technology industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel, including skilled engineers, sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate and retain qualified personnel in the future, which could impact our ability to innovate and deliver new or updated products to our customers, which could harm our\nbusiness. Among other things, our decision to close virtually all of our offices following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it harder for us to recruit and retain our personnel. If our retention and recruitment efforts are ineffective, employee turnover could increase and our ability to provide services to our customers would be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates may require in order to join our company.\nIn addition, we may not be able to outsource certain functions. We expect to evaluate our needs and the performance of our staff on a periodic basis, and may choose to make adjustments in the future. If the size of our staff is significantly reduced, either by our choice or otherwise, it may become more difficult for us to manage existing, or establish new, relationships with customers and other counter-parties, or to expand and improve our service offerings. It may also become more difficult for us to implement changes to our business plan or to respond promptly to opportunities in the marketplace. Further, it may become more difficult for us to devote personnel resources necessary to maintain or improve existing systems, including our financial and managerial controls, billing systems, reporting systems and procedures. Thus, any significant amount of staff attrition could cause our business and financial results to suffer.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. We may also need to make additional investments with third party outsourcing providers, such our announced plans to work with a digital services and consulting company to move our technology infrastructure to the public cloud. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term, and there is no guarantee that they will be successful or meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nWe regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the market price of our securities could decline.\nThe success of our business depends on retention of existing customers and their purchase of additional services, and attracting new customers and new consumer users of our consumer services.\nOur customers typically subscribe for our services for a twelve month term and may have no obligation to renew their subscription after expiration of the twelve month term. In some cases, our agreements are terminable or may terminate upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice without penalty. If a significant number of our customers, or any one customer to whom we provide a significant amount of services, were to terminate services, reduce the amount of services purchased, or fail to purchase additional services, our results of operations may be negatively and materially affected. Dissatisfaction with the nature or quality of our services could also lead customers to terminate our service.\nWe depend on monthly fees and interaction-based fees from our services for substantially all of our revenue. As part of our strategy, we are increasingly offering customers subscriptions with interaction-based fees. While this interaction-based fee model has demonstrated success in our business to date, it could potentially produce greater variability in our revenue as revenue in this model is impacted by the number of interactions that our customers generate through use of our products. Because of the historically small amount of services sold in initial orders, we depend significantly on the growth of our customer base and sales to new customers and sales of additional services to our existing customers. The success of our\nconsumer offerings similarly depends on our ability to attract and retain new customers. Our revenue could decline unless we are able to obtain additional customers or alternate revenue sources.\nOur Gainshare program offers contingent pricing and if we are unsuccessful at achieving customer objectives, the program could result in operating losses.\nThe Company has developed Gainshare, a fully managed solution where LivePerson provides messaging and AI automation technology as well as the labor, automation, and end-to-end program management. Gainshare pricing is contingent on the degree to which a customer achieves its financial objectives, such as increased revenue or reduced operating costs. If we are unsuccessful in achieving these objectives for our customers (including as a result of broader market events, such as normalization of pandemic-specific shopping trends and returns to physical, in-store shopping experiences), it will reduce the revenue that we recognize from Gainshare and could result in our operating the program at a financial loss, which could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur expansion into new products, services, and technologies could subject us to additional risks.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to expand in new products, services, and technologies. We may have limited or no experience in new market segments that we enter or new services that we decide to offer, and customers may not choose to buy or use our service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our newer activities may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, as well as, in certain circumstances, the use of alternative investment, governance, or revenue strategies that may fail to adequately align incentives across our business or otherwise accomplish our objectives. In addition, new and evolving products, services, and technologies, including those that use AI, machine learning, and blockchain, can raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our business and demand for our products and services. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.\nMajor public health issues, and specifically the pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\nOur results of operations could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on our business. While still evolving, the COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence and spread of more transmissible variants) has created significant economic disruption, and financial volatility and uncertainty both in the U.S. and around the world. Although vaccines believed to be highly effective at preventing hospitalization from COVID-19 continue to be produced and distributed, it is not possible to predict the longer term-effects that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business, including after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the rate of vaccine adoption, the effectiveness of global vaccine distribution efforts and vaccine efficacy; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions, including the potential lengthening of the sales cycle; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including through global customer summits (which were held virtually in 2020 and 2021); the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; travel restrictions and working from home; and any closures of our and our clients\u2019 offices and facilities. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work, seek to terminate existing agreements and/or delay payment terms.\nWhile we have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain. In 2020, due to health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we vacated our physical offices around the world, and transitioned to a work-from-anywhere model. While we have been able to operate effectively from remote locations, the long-term impact of such work arrangements remains unknown. For example, such remote work arrangements may increase the risk of cyber incidents or data\nbreaches and may present workplace culture challenges. Furthermore, we have incurred expenses associated with the early termination of various leases at our office locations around the world.\nWe also outsource certain critical business activities to third parties and plan to continue to increasingly do so. As a result, we rely upon the successful implementation and execution of the business continuity and repopulation planning of such entities in the current environment. While we closely monitor the business continuity activities of these third parties, successful implementation and execution of their business continuity and repopulation strategies are largely outside our control. If one or more of the third parties to whom we outsource certain critical business activities experience operational failures as a result of the impacts from the spread of COVID-19, or claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWhile governmental and non-governmental organizations are engaging in efforts to combat the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues, these measures may not be effective. We also cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues will impact our business. Such events or conditions could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future.\nAny of these events or other currently unforeseen consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, or of other pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the price of our outstanding securities.\nIf we do not successfully integrate past or potential future acquisitions, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and our business could be adversely impacted.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and will continue to make acquisitions to add complementary businesses, products, technologies, revenue and intellectual property rights. In October 2018, we acquired AdvantageTec, Inc., a leading provider of texting solutions for service departments of automotive dealerships that helps enable the conversational experience across the entire dealership, including variable and fixed operations. In September 2018, we acquired the employees and technology assets of Conversable, Inc. a SaaS based AI powered conversational platform. In January 2018, we acquired the employees and technology assets of BotCentral, Inc., a Silicon Valley based startup which has created a number of bot solutions for major brands in banking, insurance, and travel, running on LivePerson\u2019s conversational platform. In July 2021, we acquired German conversational AI company e-bot7. In October 2021, we acquired VoiceBase, Inc., a leader in real-time speech recognition and conversational analytics; and Callinize Inc., dba Tenfold, an advanced customer engagement platform for integrating communication systems with leading CRM and support services.\nAcquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to us, including:\n\u2022potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u2022inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment cost;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, products, and personnel;\n\u2022diversion of financial and management resources from efforts related to existing operations;\n\u2022risks of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u2022potential loss of our existing key employees or key employees of the company we acquire;\n\u2022inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022the tax effects of any such acquisitions.\nThese difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, expose us to unexpected costs, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nIf we do not effectively implement our plans to migrate our technology infrastructure to the public cloud, our operations could be significantly disrupted.\nWe have announced plans to migrate our technology infrastructure to the public cloud. This initiative is a major undertaking as we migrate and reconfigure our current system processes, transactions, data and controls to a new cloud-based platform. It could have a significant impact on our business processes, financial reporting, information systems and internal controls.\nAs we implement the transition of our technology infrastructure to the public cloud, we may need to divert resources away from other important business operations, including management attention. While we plan to implement business contingency and other plans to facilitate continuous internet access, sustained or concurrent service denials or similar failures could limit our ability to provide our customers access to cloud-based services or otherwise operate our business. Additionally, we may experience issues with customer migration, as many of our customers may not migrate to cloud-based technologies on a timely basis or at all or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloud-based technologies, which could negatively impact our revenue. Additionally, we may experience difficulties as we manage these changes and transition our technology infrastructure to the public cloud, including loss or corruption of data, interruptions in service and downtime, increased cyber threats and activity, delayed financial reporting, unanticipated expenses including increased costs of implementation and of conducting business, and lost revenue. Although we plan to conduct design validations and user testing, these may cause delays in transacting our business due to system challenges, limitations in functionality, inadequate management or process deficiencies in the development and use of our systems. Difficulties in implementing or an inability to effectively implement our migration plans could disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nAs we increase our reliance on public cloud infrastructure, our products and services will become increasingly reliant on continued access to, and the continued stability, reliability, and flexibility of third-party public cloud services. We have limited control over the public cloud operations and facilities on which we plan to host our technology infrastructure. Any changes in third-party service levels or any disruptions or delays from errors, defects, hacking incidents, security breaches, computer viruses, DDoS attacks, bad acts or performance problems could harm our reputation, damage our customers\u2019 businesses, and harm our business. Our public cloud providers are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, public health crises, such as COVID-19, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. Although our transition and migration to the public cloud may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs, we may have limited remedies against third-party providers in connection with such liabilities.\nAdditionally, our public cloud providers may not be able to effectively manage existing traffic levels or increased demand in capacity requirements, especially to cover peak levels or spikes in traffic, and as a result, our customers may experience delays in accessing our solutions or encounter slower performance in our solutions, which could significantly harm the operations of our customers. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, and cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates. Finally, we may in the future be unable to secure additional cloud hosting capacity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If any of our public cloud providers increases pricing terms, terminates or seeks to terminate our contractual relationship or changes or interprets their terms of service or policies in a manner that is unfavorable, we may be required to transfer to another provider and may incur significant costs and experience service interruptions.\nCapital needs necessary to execute our business strategy could increase substantially and we may not be able to secure additional financing to execute this strategy.\nTo the extent that we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business, or to pay for acquisitions, we may need to sell additional equity, issue debt or convertible securities, or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions. In the past, we have obtained financing principally through the sale of preferred stock, common stock, warrants, and convertible notes. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt or preferred equity securities, these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to holders of common stock, and could have terms that impose restrictions on our operations. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities, our stockholders could suffer dilution. We cannot assure you that additional funding, if required, will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund any potential expansion, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or products, or\notherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Those limitations would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur sales cycles can be lengthy, and the timing of sales can be difficult to predict, which may cause our operating results to vary significantly.\nThe sales cycle for our products can be several months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer, particularly for sales to enterprise customers. Because we sell complex, integrated solutions, it can take many months to close sales as customers evaluate our product offering against available alternatives and define their requirements. We are often required to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating potential customers them about the value of our offerings. The increasingly complex needs of our customers can contribute to a longer sales cycle.\nAdditionally, our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter\u2019s total sales occur in the last month, weeks and days of each quarter. These patterns make prediction of revenue especially difficult and uncertain and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in our results of operations. As a result, we are not always able to precisely predict the quarter in which expected sales will occur. In addition, historically a large portion of our revenue has derived from large orders from large clients. Consequently, delays in the closing of sales, especially from large clients, could have a material impact on the timing of revenue and results of operations.\nDelays in our implementation cycles could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain of our products require some implementation services, including but not limited to, training our customers. As an open platform, we also work with other third parties on implementing a variety of integrations into our platform. We have historically experienced a lag between signing a customer contract and recognizing revenue from that customer. Although this lag has typically ranged from 30 to 90 days, it may take more time between contract signing and recognizing revenue in certain situations. If we experience delays in implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner, we could be obligated to devote more customer support, engineering and other resources to a particular project. If new or existing customers cancel or have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services, support, or customized features, revenue recognition could be canceled or delayed and our costs could increase, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur services are subject to payment-related risks.\nFor certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards and debit cards and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted in such a way as to make compliance infeasible. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThrough our consumer-facing platform, we facilitate online transactions between individual service providers who provide online advice and information to consumers. In connection with these services, we accept payments using a variety of methods, such as credit card, debit card and PayPal. These payments are subject to \u201cchargebacks\u201d when consumers dispute payments they have made to us. Chargebacks can occur whether or not services were properly provided. Susceptibility to chargebacks puts a portion of our revenue at risk. We take measures to manage our risk relative to chargebacks and to recoup properly charged fees, however, if we are unable to successfully manage this risk our business and operating results could be adversely affected. As we offer new payment options to our users, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, and fraud.\nWe are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business.\nWe may experience difficulties integrating e-bot7, VoiceBase and Tenfold, and may not realize expected business or financial benefits and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we acquired e-bot7, a Conversational AI company. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired VoiceBase, a leader in real time speech recognition and conversational analytics and Tenfold, an advanced customer engagement platform for integrating communication systems with leading CRM and support systems. We intend to maintain the business operations of each of these companies while integrating and leveraging e-bot7\u2019s self-service capabilities, Tenfold\u2019s technology platform, and VoiceBase\u2019s technology with our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings. However, acquiring and integrating a technology company presents unique risks including difficulties in adapting and developing new software technologies and systems protocols, increased software integration expenses, and incompatibility of acquired technologies in addition to the risks discussed under \u201cIf we do not successfully integrate past or potential future acquisitions, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and our business could be adversely impacted.\u201d\nOur business of facilitating at-home rapid-testing solutions poses substantial risks.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, our subsidiary Bella Health began to offer its corporate customers access to a digital mobile application that provides our customers\u2019 employees with FDA-approved rapid-antigen COVID-19 tests (provided by a qualified third-party), guided self-administration, and access to experts through messaging and Conversational AI.\nThe business of Bella Health poses certain risks, including our lack of experience operating in the healthcare industry and elevated risks related to compliance with federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations pertaining to the healthcare and diagnostic testing industry.\nThese risks include among other things, potential fines and other penalties for failure to protect the security of, and the unauthorized sharing of, health information, or our failure to comply with health care laws and regulations, for each of which we may not have sufficient insurance or indemnification rights. In addition, the revenue we generate from Bella Health may decrease due to reduced demand for COVID-19 testing if the number of COVID-19 infections continues to decrease, unless we are able to develop other product offerings that offset this decrease.\nOur expansion into digital healthcare poses substantial new risks to which we have not previously been exposed.\nThese risks include our lack of experience operating in the healthcare industry and elevated risks relating to compliance with certain U.S. federal, state, and local healthcare laws, regulations, and rules in the heavily-regulated healthcare industry, including: state laws relating to the licensure of medical professionals; state laws regulating telehealth and online healthcare services; state laws that prohibit general business corporations from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions, or engaging in certain practices, such as splitting fees with physicians; state law provisions relating to anti-kickback, self-referral, and false claims; provisions of, and regulations relating to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its accompanying regulations (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), including provisions relating to the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information; and federal and state laws relating to the provision of services by non-physician clinical providers (such as physician assistants or nurses); and exposure to liability, which may include liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws, regulations, and rules for which we may not have sufficient insurance or indemnification rights.\nIn addition, if we were to start accepting payments from third party payors, including, among others, private insurance companies or government payors (such as Medicaid or Medicaid), it would create additional compliance obligations, including: federal laws that prohibit entities from submitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs; federal laws that prohibit the receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of patients for items and services covered, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs; federal laws prohibiting physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician (or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family) has a direct or indirect financial relationship with the entity; federal laws relating to failure to disclose or refund overpayments by a government payor; federal and state laws the prohibit healthcare providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare or Medicaid for services, unless the services are medically necessary; and federal laws that impose civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs, or employing individuals who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs.\nAccordingly, to the extent they are or become applicable as and if we continue to grow in the digital healthcare space, we must monitor our compliance with applicable healthcare laws, regulations, and rules in every jurisdiction in which we operate,\non an ongoing basis, and we cannot provide assurance that our activities and arrangements, if challenged, will be found to be in compliance. Even if our activities and arrangements are found to be in compliance, investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. Compliance may require obtaining appropriate licenses or certificates, increasing our security measures and expending additional resources to monitor developments in applicable rules and ensure compliance. Additionally, it is possible that the laws, regulations and rules governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. Any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or rules or any review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation depends, in part, on factors which are partially or entirely outside of our control.\nOur services typically appear under the LivePerson brand or as a LivePerson-branded icon on our customers\u2019 websites. The customer service operators and Experts who respond to the inquiries of our customers\u2019 users are employees or agents of our customers or independent consultants rather than employees of LivePerson. As a result, we are not able to control the actions of these operators or Experts and the impression that such operator or Expert leaves the user with whom they interact. A user may not know that the operator or Expert is not a LivePerson employee. If a user were to have a negative experience in a LivePerson-powered real-time dialogue, it is possible that this experience could be attributed to us, which could diminish our brand and harm our business. Additionally, we believe the success of our business services is aided by the prominent placement of the chat icon on a customer\u2019s website, over which we also have no control.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers, business partners and other key stakeholders. Businesses face increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, sustainability and social responsibility. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention, our corporate culture and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Operating Results\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause a substantial decline in the trading price of our securities.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses and experience negative cash flows, either or both of which may be significant and may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly. These fluctuations may result from a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain new customers;\n\u2022our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers;\n\u2022demand from customers and consumers for our services;\n\u2022our ability to innovate and provide new services to current and future customers;\n\u2022our ability to continue to add artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation into our services;\n\u2022the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to avoid and/or manage service interruptions, disruptions, or security incidents;\n\u2022changes in our pricing models or policies or in those of our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and add integrations with third-party consumer messaging platforms and endpoints;\n\u2022continued adoption by companies of mobile and cloud-based messaging solutions;\n\u2022investments in growing our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022continued adoption by Experts and Users of web-based advice services;\n\u2022exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs related to operation and expansion of our business, including those related to acquisitions.\nOur revenue and operating results may also fluctuate significantly in the future due to the following factors that are entirely outside of our control:\n\u2022new laws, regulations, or regulatory or law enforcement initiatives;\n\u2022economic conditions specific to the web, mobile technology, electronic commerce, and cloud computing; consequences of unexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, outbreaks of contagious disease (e.g., COVID-19), or climate change; and\n\u2022general, regional, and/or global economic and political conditions.\nAs a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely upon these comparisons or our past results as indicators of our future performance. Due to the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors or below any guidance we may provide to the market. If this occurs, the trading price of our securities could decline significantly.\nIn the past we have experienced losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $516.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and we may incur losses in the future.\nWe have in the past incurred, and we may in the future incur, losses and experience negative cash flow, either or both of which may be significant. We recorded net losses from inception through the year ended December 31, 2003. We recorded net income for the years ended December 31, 2004 through 2007 and 2009 through 2012, while we recorded net losses for the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2013 through 2021. We recorded a net loss of $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was approximately $516.9 million. We cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Failure to maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThe non-payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of customers may negatively impact our financial condition or make it difficult to forecast our revenues accurately.\nDuring 2021, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from $5.3 million to approximately $6.3 million. During 2020, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from $3.1 million to approximately $5.3 million. We base our allowance for doubtful accounts on specifically identified credit risks of customers, historical trends, and other information that we believe to be reasonable. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles. We adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts previously reserved have been collected. As a result of increasingly long payment cycles, we have faced increased difficulty in predicting our operating results for any given period, and have experienced significant unanticipated fluctuations in our revenues from period to period. Any failure to achieve anticipated revenues in a period could cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our securities could decline.\nWith the recent volatility in the capital markets, there is a risk that we could suffer a loss of principal in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and suffer a reduction in our interest income or in our return on investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $521.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. We regularly invest excess funds from our cash and cash equivalents in short-term money market funds. We currently hold no mortgaged-backed or auction rate securities. However, some of our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by any ongoing uncertainty in the United States and global credit markets. In the future, these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may harm the results of our operations, liquidity and financial condition. Although we believe we have chosen a portfolio reasonably designed to preserve our existing cash position, it may not adequately protect the value of our investments. Furthermore, this more cautious portfolio is unlikely to provide us with any significant interest income in the near term.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, declines in business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 or more months. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or cancellations of existing subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new customers and additional revenue from existing customers is generally recognized over the applicable subscription term, rather than immediately.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We review our goodwill for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. Based on our annual review for 2021, we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying amount. However, future assessments may yield a different result, and from time to time, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Industry Dynamics and Competition\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with partners, service partners, social media, and other third-party consumer messaging platforms and endpoints, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that continued growth for companies in our industry depends, in part, on enabling brands to connect with consumers across consumers\u2019 preferred conversational interfaces and messaging endpoints, such as SMS, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, and Alexa. In order to grow our business, we have identified and developed, and maintain, strategic relationships with many key technology partners. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to further develop partnerships and specific solution areas with additional technology partners. We typically rely on our strategic partners and third-party service providers to supplement our own subject matter expertise and to leverage industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. If we fail to establish these relationships in a timely and cost-effective manner or at all, if these strategic partners or third-party service providers fail to provide the services expected, or if we lose any or all of our current relationships, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Replacing a strategic relationship could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses. Additionally, even if we are successful at developing these relationships, but there are problems or issues with the integrations, or our ability to scale and onboard our customers onto new endpoints, our reputation, and ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have announced plans to migrate our technology infrastructure to the public cloud, and may in the future be unable to secure additional cloud hosting capacity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If any of our public cloud providers increases pricing terms, terminates or seeks to terminate our contractual relationship, establishes more favorable relationships with our competitors, or changes or interprets their terms of service or policies in a manner that is unfavorable with respect to us, we may be required to transfer to another provider and may incur significant costs and experience service interruptions.\nIf we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet and complete transactions over the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including smartphones, handheld tablets, and mobile phones, has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. To address these developments, we continue to extend our products and services to support messaging on mobile phone and tablet applications belonging to our company and our customers. If the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet our customers\u2019 needs or the needs of their website visitors, or are not widely adopted by our customers and consumers, we may fail to retain existing customers and we may have difficulty attracting new customers. Such solutions may also create new risks related to privacy and security, which could subject us to investigations, litigation, or reputational harm. If we are unable to rapidly innovate and grow mobile revenue, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to continue to grow overall revenue may be negatively affected.\nAdditionally, our mobile phone and tablet applications and those of our customers depend on their interoperability with popular mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we and they do not control, such as Android and iOS operating systems, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade the functionality of our solutions or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect our revenue. We may not be successful in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, or standards. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may lose customers and revenue if we are not able to innovate or effectively compete.\nThe markets for mobile and online business messaging and digital engagement and AI technology are intensely competitive, rapidly changing, and characterized by aggressive marketing, pricing pressure, evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments, and frequent new product introductions. We believe that competition will continue to increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market, which may cause additional pressure. If we are unable to accurately anticipate technology developments and continue to innovate in the markets in which we compete and develop successful integrations with third-party consumer messaging platforms, AI providers, and endpoints, or our competitors are more successful than us at developing compelling new products, services, and integrations, or at attracting and retaining customers, we may lose revenue and market share and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have current and potential competition from providers of messaging and digital engagement solutions that enable companies to engage and connect with their consumer customers, as well as technology providers that offer customer relationship management and contact center solutions. We have current and potential competitors in many different industries, including:\n\u2022technology or service providers offering or powering competing digital engagement, contact center, communications, or customer relationship management solutions, such as eGain, Genesys, Nuance, Oracle, Salesforce.com, and Twilio;\n\u2022service providers that offer basic messaging products or services with limited functionality free of charge or at significantly reduced entry level prices;\n\u2022social media, social listening, messaging, artificial intelligence, bots, e-commerce, and/or data and data analytics companies, such as Facebook, Google, and WeChat, which may leverage their existing or future capabilities and consumer relationships to offer competing B2B solutions; and\n\u2022customers that develop and manage their messaging solutions in-house.\nIn addition, many of our current and potential competitors have substantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand recognition, significantly larger financial, marketing, and resource and development budgets, access to larger customer and/or\nconsumer bases, larger and more established marketing and distribution relationships, and/or more diverse product and service offerings. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to any change in the general market acceptance of messaging services or any new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, pricing strategies, or customer requirements. Also, because of these advantages, potential customers may select a competitor\u2019s products and services, even if our services are more effective. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing customer preferences in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or online consumer services industries and this may harm our business.\nIf we are unable, for technological, legal, financial, or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or e-commerce industry or our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 requirements or preferences, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Online business is characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the market for online sales, marketing, customer service, and expert advice solutions is relatively new. Sudden changes in customer and consumer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry and regulatory standards and practices such as but not limited to data privacy and security standards, could render the LivePerson services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. The rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022enhance the features and performance of our services;\n\u2022develop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online as well as consumers; and\n\u2022respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nIf any of our new services, including upgrades to our current services, do not meet our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 expectations, we could lose customers and our business may be harmed. Updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf new services require us to grow rapidly, this could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow, our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDownturns in the global economic environment or in particular industries in which our sales are concentrated may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. and other global economies have experienced in the past and could in the future experience economic downturn that affects all sectors of the economy, particularly in the financial services and retail industries, resulting in declines in economic growth and consumer confidence, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Further, there is increased uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and trade policies in the U.S., which could impact our global operations and our business. Global credit and financial markets have in the past experienced extreme disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations. Our business has been affected by these conditions in the past and could be similarly impacted in the future by any downturn in global economic conditions.\nOur business is, and will continue to be, dependent on sales to customers in the telecommunications, financial services, retail, automotive, real estate and technology industries. A downturn in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event that industry conditions deteriorate in one or more of these industries, we could experience, among other things, cancellation or non-renewal of existing contracts, reduced demand for our products and reduced sales. It could be difficult to predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, either relating to the global economic environment or to the particular industries in which our sales are concentrated, which, in turn, could make it more challenging for us to forecast\nour operating results, make business decisions and identify risks that may adversely affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeak economic conditions may also cause our customers to experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans. Our customers may reduce their spending on our services, may not be able to discharge their payment and other obligations to us, may experience difficulty raising capital, or may elect to scale back the resources they devote to customer service and/or sales and marketing technology, including services such as ours. Economic conditions may also lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to decrease or delay their purchases of our products and services. If economic conditions deteriorate for us or our customers, we could be required to record charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets, may not be able to collect receivables on a timely basis, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Security Vulnerabilities and Service Reliability\nFailures or security breaches in our services or systems, those of our third party service providers, or in the websites of our customers, including those resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities, defects, or errors, could harm our business.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and personal data related to our customers and their users, as well as experts and consumers, and theft and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of such information and data, improper use and disclosure thereof, litigation, regulatory investigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee or other error, intentional malfeasance and other third party acts, and system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our third party service providers, or customers, or otherwise. We have announced plans to move our technology infrastructure to the public cloud, which will require us to rely on third-party cloud providers to maintain appropriate safeguards. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our office employees are working remotely. We currently expect this to continue for the foreseeable future, which may potentially further increase the risk of cyber incidents or data breaches. Any such breach or unauthorized access, or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, users, vendors, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or data of our customers, users, experts, or consumers, including, but not limited to, individual personal information and financial credit or debit card data that is protected by law or contract, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we continue to expand our focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products and services from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones and handheld devices, cyber-attacks, and other security incidents continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, are constantly evolving in sophisticated ways to avoid detection and often are not recognized until launched against a target, it may be difficult or impossible for us to anticipate or identify these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. And while technological advancements enable more data and processes, such as mobile computing and mobile payments, they also increase the risk that cyber-attacks and other security incidents will occur. We engage third parties to review and assist in safeguarding our products and services from such threats. Those parties may identify vulnerabilities, some of which may not be immediately remedied. A significant cyber-attack, or a security incident of any magnitude that is profiled in the media, involving our, our third party service providers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 systems, could result in material harm to our brand and reputation, our ability to deliver our services or retain customers, and expose us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and significant damages, fines or penalties.\nIn addition, our customers may authorize third party access to their customer data located in our cloud environment. Because we do not control the transmissions to customer-authorized third parties, or the processing of such data by customer authorized third parties, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Because our services are responsible for critical communication between our customers and consumers, any security failures, defects or errors in our components, materials or software or those used by our customers could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and on the end users of their websites. Such adverse impact could include a decrease in demand for our services, damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships, legal exposure, and other financial liability or harm to our business.\nWe may be liable if third parties access or misappropriate confidential or personal data from our systems or services.\nThe dialogue transcripts of the text-based chats, email interactions and other interactions between our customers and their users may include information, such as personal contact and demographic information. Although we employ and continually\ntest and update our security measures to protect this information from unauthorized access, it is still possible that our security measures could be breached and such a breach could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques employed by hackers to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated in circumventing security measures and avoiding detection, we may be unable to anticipate all techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in disclosure of our trade secrets or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee data. If third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate personal data relating to our customers\u2019 users or the text of customer service inquiries, our competitive position may be harmed and we could be subject to liability. In the event of a security incident, we could be required to comply with a myriad of breach notification laws at the state, federal and international level, which may cause business disruption and extensive notification costs, and could lead to penalties, government investigations and lawsuits for compliance failures. We may as a result of a security incident be deemed out of compliance with U.S. federal and state laws, international laws, or contractual commitments, and we may be subject to government investigations, lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, and other costs to respond to breach or security incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate the harm and alleviate problems caused by such breaches. While we currently maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber security risks, such insurance coverage is subject to certain exclusions and exceptions and may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nFurthermore, certain software and services that we use to operate our business are hosted and/or operated by third parties or integrated with our systems. For example, as we expand our use of cloud-based services, we will increasingly rely on third-party cloud providers to maintain appropriate safeguards to protect confidential or personal data we receive. While we intend to conduct due diligence on these cloud providers with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the visibility to effectively monitor the implementation and efficacy of these controls. If third-party services were to be interrupted or their security breached, our business operations could be similarly disrupted and we could be exposed to liability and costly investigations or litigation. The need to properly secure, and securely transmit and store, confidential information online has historically been a significant barrier to e-commerce and online communications, and will become increasingly highlighted as a consumer and regulatory focus and concern. Any publicized compromise of security could deter people from using online services such as the ones we offer or from using them to conduct transactions, which involve transmitting confidential information. Because our success depends on the general acceptance and reputation of our services and electronic commerce, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nWe provide service level commitments to certain customers. If we do not meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our reputation.\nAs is common for many cloud service providers, we offer service level commitments in certain of our customer contracts, primarily related to uptime of our service. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer periods of downtime that exceed the periods allowed under our customer contracts, whether due to downtime caused by us or our third-party service providers, which has occurred on several occasions in the past and could occur in the future (including in connection with the migration of our technology infrastructure to the public cloud), we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits and/or pay financial penalties, which could significantly impact our revenue. In addition, even if our contracts provide otherwise, these customers may attempt to terminate or reduce their contracts, which has occurred from time to time, and/or pursue other legal remedies. Recurring or extended service outages could also cause damage to our reputation and result in substantial customer dissatisfaction or loss, which could adversely affect our current and future revenue and operating results.\nWe are dependent on technology systems and third-party content that are beyond our control.\nThe success of our services depends in part on our customers\u2019 online services as well as the Internet and mobile connectivity of consumers, both of which are outside of our control. As a result, it may be difficult to identify the source of problems if they occur. In the past, we have experienced problems related to connectivity, which has resulted in slower than normal response times to user messaging requests and interruptions in service. Our services rely both on the Internet and on our connectivity vendors for data transmission. Therefore, even when connectivity problems are not caused by our services, our customers or their consumers may attribute the problem to us. This could diminish our brand and harm our business, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts or cause significant customer relations problems.\nIn addition, we rely in part on third party service providers and other third parties for various services, including, but not limited to, Internet connectivity, network infrastructure hosting, security and maintenance, and software and hardware from a variety of vendors. These providers may experience problems that result in slower than normal response times and/or interruptions in service. If we are unable to continue utilizing the third party services that support our web hosting and infrastructure or if our services experience interruptions or delays due to existing third party service providers or transition to new third party service providers, our reputation and business could be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal and reputational risk, and significant remediation costs.\nWe also rely on the security of our third party service providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. Information technology system failures, including a breach of our or our third party service providers\u2019 data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, an unintentional disclosure of customer information or loss of information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third party service providers, information systems may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, ransomware, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, obtain, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 data. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of business collaboration and communications solutions and could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, as well as government investigations and claims for damages or injunctive relief under state, federal and foreign laws or contractual agreements.\nWe also depend on third parties for hardware and software, and our consumer services depend on third parties for content. Such products and content could contain defects or inaccurate information. Problems arising from our use of such hardware or software or third party content could require us to incur significant costs or divert the attention of our technical or other personnel from our product development efforts or to manage issues related to content. To the extent any such problems require us to replace such hardware or software we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe depend on the continued viability of the infrastructure of the Internet.\nTo the extent that the Internet continues to experience growth in the number of users and frequency of use by consumers resulting in increased bandwidth demands, we cannot assure you that the infrastructure for the Internet will be able to support the demands placed upon it. The Internet has experienced outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. Outages or delays could adversely affect online sites, email and the level of traffic on the Internet. The Internet is also subject to continued and ongoing cyber-attacks and related conduct, which affect all online businesses. We also depend on Internet service providers that provide our customers and Internet users with access to the LivePerson services. In the past, users have experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our service. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity. Insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the Internet also could result in slower response times and negatively impact use of the Internet generally, and our customers\u2019 sites (including their use of the Conversational Cloud) in particular. If the infrastructure of the Internet does not effectively support the growth of the Internet, we may not maintain profitability and our business, results of operations, and financial condition will suffer.\nTechnological or other defects could disrupt or negatively impact our services, which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe face risks related to the technological capabilities of our services. We expect the number of interactions between our customers\u2019 operators and consumers over our system to increase significantly as we expand our customer base. Our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume. Additionally, we must continually upgrade our software to improve the features and functionality of our services in order to be competitive in our markets. If future versions of our software contain undetected errors, our business could be harmed. If third-party content is flawed, our business could be harmed. As a result of software upgrades at LivePerson, our customer sites have, from time to time, experienced slower than normal response times and interruptions in service. If we experience system failures or degraded response times, our reputation and brand could be harmed. We may also experience technical problems in the process of installing and initiating the LivePerson services on new web hosting services, including in connection with our plans to migrate our technology infrastructure to the public cloud. These problems, if not remedied, could harm our business.\nOur services also depend on complex software which may contain defects, particularly when we introduce new versions onto our servers. We may not discover software defects that affect our new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed. It is possible that, despite testing by us, defects may occur in the software. These defects could result in:\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022lost sales;\n\u2022contract terminations;\n\u2022loss of market share;\n\u2022delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors.\nOur products are complex, and errors, failures, or \u201cbugs\u201d may be difficult to correct.\nOur products are complex, integrating hardware, software and elements of a customers\u2019 existing infrastructure. Despite quality assurance testing conducted prior to the release of our products our software may contain \u201cbugs\u201d that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such issues could interfere with the expected operation of a solution, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins. Depending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a negative impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, damage to our reputation, litigation, and/or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover expenses associated with such events.\nFailure to license necessary third party software for use in our products and services, or failure to successfully integrate third party software, could cause delays or reductions in our sales, or errors or failures of our service.\nWe license third party software that we plan to incorporate into our products and services. In the future, we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer requirements. These licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Some of this technology could be difficult to replace once integrated. The loss of, or inability to obtain, these licenses could result in delays or reductions of our products and services until we identify, license and integrate or develop equivalent software, and new licenses could require us to pay higher royalties. If we are unable to successfully license and integrate third party technology, we could experience a reduction in functionality and/or errors or failures of our products, which may reduce demand for our products and services.\nThird-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the impact of new technology integration on our existing technology, open source software disclosure requirements, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods, and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism or cyber-attacks.\nAlthough we intend to migrate our technology infrastructure to the public cloud, a substantial majority of our computer and communications infrastructure is running in our private cloud on hardware that is located at a limited number of facilities in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, other acts of nature, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, cyber-attacks or failures, pandemics or other public health crises, or similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. Our headquarters are located in New York City and we have a significant employee presence located in Israel, each of which regions has experienced acts of terrorism in the past. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, cyber-attacks, such as coordinated denial-of-service attacks or ransomware, or other failures, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer data. Although we have implemented security measures and disaster recovery capabilities, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from business interruption, or unavailability or loss of data, as a result of any such events. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide\nhigh quality service to our customers, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, result in loss of existing or potential customers and increased expenses, and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the reputation of our products and services, any of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Data Privacy Issues\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, and increased public scrutiny of privacy and security issues could result in increased government regulation, industry standards, and other legal obligations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect, process, store, and use personal data and other information generated during mobile and online messaging between brands and consumers and between experts and consumers. We post our privacy policies and practices on our websites and we also often include privacy commitments in our contracts. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, personal information, security, data collection, storage, use and transfer, and the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies. To the extent that additional legislation regarding user privacy is enacted, such as legislation governing the collection and use of information regarding Internet or mobile users through the use of cookies or similar technologies, the effectiveness of our services could be impaired by restricting us from collecting or using information that may be valuable to our customers and/or exposing us to lawsuits or regulatory investigations. The foregoing could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nU.S. and international privacy laws and regulations are evolving and changing, subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in these countries, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements will likely increase. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations relating to data privacy and data protection, or the privacy commitments contained in our contracts, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, consumers, watchdog groups or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals and enactments could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nLaws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental entities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for, and in many instances, enacted increased regulation and changes in industry practices. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, replacing the E.U. Data Protection Directive, imposes significantly greater compliance burdens on companies that control or process personal data of users primarily located in the E.U. and, for noncompliance, provides for considerable fines up to the higher of 20 million Euros or 4% of global annual revenue. European regulators have issued numerous fines pursuant to the GDPR. One material change is that data processors (as that term is defined by applicable E.U. data protection law) have direct obligations, including implementing technical and organizational measures, and are subject to enhanced notification rules. The GDPR also imposes certain technological requirements that may, from time to time, require us to make changes to our services to enable LivePerson and/or our customers to meet legal requirements and may impact how data protection is addressed in our customer and vendor agreements. Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our services or business practices fail to comply. We also must require vendors that process personal data to take on additional privacy and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us to incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. If our policies and practices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient, we could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by Data Protection Authorities (including in the E.U.) or lawsuits by private parties, and our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe E.U. has also released a proposed Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (\u201ce-Privacy Regulation\u201d) to replace the E.U.\u2019s Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (\u201ce-Privacy Directive\u201d) to, among other things, better align with the GDPR, to amend the current e-Privacy Directive\u2019s rules on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, and to harmonize across current E.U. member state e-privacy data protection laws. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations related to privacy may require significant cost, limit the use and adoption of our services, and require material changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in material fines and penalties, litigation, regulatory investigation and/or governmental orders requiring us to change our data practices, which could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nAdditionally, as web and mobile commerce continues to evolve, regulation by federal, state and foreign governments or agencies in the areas of data privacy and data security is likely to increase. For instance, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and regulatory compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d) to the United States and certain other third countries. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the \u201cE.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield\u201d) under which personal information could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield program. Similarly, on September 8, 2020, the Swiss Data Protection Authority announced in a position statement that it no longer considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield adequate for the purpose of transferring personal data from Switzerland to the United States. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of E.U.-specified standard contractual clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism, it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the surveillance laws in and the right of individuals afforded by, the destination country. The CJEU went on to state that, if the competent supervisory authority believes that the SCCs cannot be complied with in the destination country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer unless the data exporter has already done so itself. Ongoing legal challenges in the E.U. to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the EEA to certain other jurisdictions, including the U.S., following the CJEU\u2019s decision may result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that permit cross-border data transfers.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew its membership from the E.U., which is commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result, we became subject to the GDPR as incorporated into UK law through the Data Protection Act of 2018 (\u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d). The relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, however, and it is unclear how U.K. data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, including how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated in the long term. Any changes to these laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. The updated SCCs apply only to the transfer of data outside of the EEA and not the U.K. Although the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the U.K. on June 28, 2021, allowing the continued flow of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom, this decision will automatically expire four years after its entry into force, will be regularly reviewed going forward and may be revoked if the U.K. diverges from its current adequate data protection laws following its exit from the E.U.\nWe rely on a mixture of mechanisms to govern the transfer of personal data from our E.U. and U.K. business to the U.S. and are continuing to evaluate what additional mechanisms may be required to establish adequate safeguards for the cross-border transfer of personal data. The European Commission updated the SCCs on June 4, 2021, and additional regulatory guidance has been released that seeks to impose additional obligations on companies choosing to rely on the SCCs. Parties transferring personal data from the EEA to third countries with \u201cinadequate data protection\u201d such as the U.S. will have until December 27, 2022 to update any existing agreements, or any new agreements executed before September 27, 2021, that rely on SCCs. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of data outside of the EEA and not the U.K., though on January 31, 2022, the U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Officer announced that proposals for the U.K.\u2019s own form of agreement and addendum to the E.U. SCCs (the \u201cU.K. SCCs\u201d), which could be used for transfers for data from the U.K., have been laid before Parliament. If no objections are raised in Parliament and the proposals are approved, the U.K. SCCs will come into force on March 21, 2022 (subject to a grace period for implementation). The outcome of the consultation has yet to be published. As such, any transfers by us or our vendors of personal data from the E.U./U.K. may not comply with E.U./U.K. data protection laws, may increase our exposure to the GDPR\u2019s/U.K. GDPR\u2019s heightened sanctions for violations of their cross-border data transfer restrictions and may reduce demand for our products from companies subject to E.U./U.K. data protection laws. If we are unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services and could adversely affect our financial results, and, until the legal uncertainties regarding how to legally continue transfers pursuant to the SCCs and other mechanisms are settled, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under the GDPR will be sufficient. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nIn addition to the changing regulatory landscape in the E.U. and the U.K., in June 2018, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect in January of 2020. The CCPA gives California residents new data privacy rights, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new private cause of action for data breaches. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with a lookback to January 1, 2022), will significantly modify the CCPA, and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, potentially resulting in further complexity and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Similarly, other states, such as\nVirginia and Colorado, have instituted privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, and many similar laws have been proposed at the federal and state level; accordingly, we also may be subject to additional compliance obligations as such legislation is considered and adopted, which may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established and may continue to establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If our privacy practices are deemed unacceptable by watchdog groups or privacy advocates, such groups may take measures that harm our business by, for example, disparaging our reputation and our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, privacy concerns may cause consumers to avoid online sites that collect various forms of data or to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception of data security and data privacy concerns, whether or not valid, could inhibit sales and market acceptance of our products and services.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, and existing, new and developing regulatory or other legal requirements could subject us to claims or materially impact our business.\nWe and our customers are subject to a number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws related to conducting business on the Internet or mobile devices, such as laws regarding data privacy, data protection, information security, cybersecurity, restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, transfer or other processing of consumer data, content, consumer protection, internet (or net) neutrality, advertising, electronic contracts, taxation, provision of online payment services (including credit card processing), and intellectual property rights, which are continuously evolving and developing. Because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even if we do not have a local entity, employees or infrastructure. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations may often be more restrictive than those in the United States. The scope and interpretation of the laws and other obligations that apply to us, including those related to user privacy and data security, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws and obligations outside the U.S. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied differently in any given jurisdiction in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices, which could cause us to incur substantial cost and could negatively impact our brand, reputation and business.\nBusinesses using our products and services may collect data from their users. Various federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies impose laws regarding collection, use, storage, retention, disposal, transfer or other processing of data from website visitors. We offer our customers a variety of data security procedures and practices, such as encryption for data at rest and masking algorithms for sensitive data prior to transfer to our database, in an effort to protect information. Changes to applicable laws and how they are interpreted relating to privacy and data security could significantly increase the cost to us and our customers of regulatory compliance and could negatively impact our business.\nFor instance, some states in the U.S. have enacted legislation designed to protect consumer privacy by prohibiting the distribution of \u201cspyware\u201d over the Internet. Such legislation typically focuses on restricting the proliferation of software that, when installed on an end user\u2019s computer, is used to intentionally and deceptively take control of the end user\u2019s machine. We do not believe that the data monitoring methods that we employ constitute \u201cspyware\u201d or are prohibited by applicable laws. However, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, many of which can be enforced by government entities or private parties, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant changes in application and interpretation. If, for example, the scope of the previously mentioned \u201cspyware\u201d legislation were changed to include web analytics, such legislation could apply to the technology we use and potentially restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nFurther, various federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies are highly focused on consumer protection initiatives, particularly in light of the increase in new technologies and services that incorporate or use bots, artificial intelligence and/or machine learning. For example, the California B.O.T. Act came into effect in July 2019 and requires that companies using bots on platforms with more than 10 million unique monthly visitors from the U.S. use clear and conspicuous disclosure to inform consumers that they are not speaking to a human. Similar bills have been introduced from time to time at the state and federal level in recent years. Further, use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may be subject to laws and evolving regulations regarding the use of artificial intelligence, controlling for, among other things, data bias, and antidiscrimination. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) enforces consumer protection laws such as Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive practices, including use of biased algorithms in AI. The European Commission also recently published its proposal for a regulation implementing harmonized rules on AI and amending certain union legislative acts. The proposed regulation would impose additional restrictions and obligations on providers of AI systems, including increasing transparency so consumers know they are interacting with an AI system, requiring human oversight in AI,\nand prohibiting certain practices of AI that could lead to physical or psychological harm. Given the increased focus by the FTC and other regulators on the use of AI, it is possible that additional laws, regulations, and standards related to AI may be introduced in the future. Regulation in this area could impact how businesses use our products and services to interact with consumers and how we provide our services to our customers. AI tools can also present unique technological and legal challenges, such as the possibility of insufficient data sets, or (as stated above) data sets that contain biased information, which can negatively impact the decisions, predictions or analyses that AI applications produce. Deficiencies such as these could cause us reputational harm and subject us to legal liability, including claims of product liability, breach of warranty, or negligence.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities and governments around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, collection and use of website visitor data, data storage, data protection, the \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal information, online advertising, email and other categories of electronic spam, and other matters that may be applicable to our business. Compliance with these laws may require substantial investment or may be technologically challenging for us. For example, some jurisdictions, including in the United States, are considering whether the collection of anonymous data may invade the privacy of website visitors. If laws or regulations are enacted that limit data collection or use practices related to anonymous data, we and/or our customers may be required to obtain the express consent of web visitors in order for our technology to perform certain basic functions that are based on the collection and use of technical data. Requirements that a website must first obtain consent from its web visitors before using our technology could reduce the amount and value of the services we provide to customers, which might impede sales and/or cause some existing customers to discontinue using our services.\nIt is also likely that, as our business grows and evolves, an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and our solutions are offered and used in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. We may need to expend considerable effort and resources to develop new product features and/or procedures to comply with any such legal requirements. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will apply to our business and what new laws and legal obligations we may become subject to. If we are not able to comply with these laws or other legal obligations, or if we become liable under them, we may be forced to implement material changes to our business practices, delay release of new and enhanced services and expend substantial resources, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any increased attention focused on liability issues, or as a result of regulatory fines or lawsuits, could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.\nWe monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments. Due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. A range of other proposed or existing laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example:\nGovernment agencies and regulators have reviewed, are reviewing and will continue to review, the personal data handling practices of companies doing business online, including privacy and security policies and practices. This review may result in new laws or the promulgation of new regulations or guidelines that may apply to our products and services. For example, the State of California and other states have passed laws relating to disclosure of companies\u2019 practices with regard to Do-Not-Track signals from Internet browsers, the ability to delete information of minors, and new data breach notification requirements. Outside the E.U. and the U.S., a number of countries have adopted or are considering privacy laws and regulations that may result in significant greater compliance burdens. Existing and proposed laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and monitoring of online behavioral data, such as proposed \u201cDo Not Track\u201d regulations, regulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices and collection and use of data from mobile devices, new and existing tools that allow consumers to block online advertising and other content, and other proposed online privacy legislation could potentially apply to some of our current or planned products and services. Existing and proposed laws and regulations related to email and other categories of electronic spam could impact the delivery of commercial email and other electronic communications by us or on behalf of customers using our services.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) in particular has aggressively investigated and brought enforcement actions against companies that fail to comply with their privacy or data security commitments to consumers, or fail to comply with regulations or statutes such as the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. Any investigation or review of our practices may require us to make changes to our products and policies, which could harm our business. Currently there are many proposals by lawmakers and industry groups in this area, both in the United States and overseas, which address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, and establish data security and breach notification\nrequirements. Further, regulators and industry groups have also released self-regulatory principles and guidelines for various data privacy and security practices. Given that this is an evolving and unsettled area of regulation, the imposition of any new significant restrictions or technological requirements could have a negative impact on our business.\nVarious governmental bodies and many customers and businesses are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance issues, which has in the past resulted, and may in the future continue to result, in the adoption of new laws and regulations and changing buying practices. If we fail to keep pace with these developments, our reputation and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe might unintentionally violate such laws now or in the future; such laws or their interpretation or application may be modified; and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could subject us to legal liability exposure, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and could subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nCertain of our products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Exports of our products and the provision of our services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular deployment may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our products or services, or changes in applicable export or economic sanctions regulations may create delays in the introduction and deployment of our products and services in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products or provision of our services to certain countries or end users. Any change in export or economic sanctions regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products and services, or in our decreased ability to export our products or provide our services to existing or prospective customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products and services or limitation on our ability to export our products and provide our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers\u2019 ability to import our products into those countries. Encryption products and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products and provision of our services, including with respect to new releases of our products and services, may create delays in the introduction of our products and services in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products and using our services throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products or provision of our services to some countries altogether.\nIndustry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions could harm our business.\nOur customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators of various industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers\u2019 use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or that require financial services providers to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed and we may be unable to conduct business with customers in such industries. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as the PCI Data Security Standards,\nmay have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable in the future to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or comply with other similar requirements or standards that are relevant to our customers, our business and our revenue may be adversely impacted.\nIn some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings into new conversational businesses. For example, we recently launched a new conversational banking initiative. While we are relying on the banking license of a third party and certain of their compliance programs for this initiative, if we or our partner fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, fail to successfully manage our regulatory or compliance obligations, or fail to obtain and maintain required licenses, we could be subject to fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies, regulatory bodies, and/or private litigation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture regulation of the Internet or mobile devices may slow our growth, resulting in decreased demand for our services and increased costs of doing business.\nState, federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies that conduct business online or that adversely affect the growth or use of the Internet or mobile commerce. For example, these laws and regulations could discourage communication by e-mail or other web-based communications, particularly targeted e-mail of the type facilitated by our services, which could reduce demand for our services. Laws or regulations that affect the use of the Internet or mobile devices, including but not limited to laws affecting net neutrality could also decrease demand for our services and increase our costs. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by Internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, in the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules effective June 11, 2018, which could lead internet access providers to restrict, block, degrade or charge for access to our products and services, while California, among other states, have passed legislation that seeks to reestablish net neutrality. Further, regulatory focus on data privacy, data security and consumer protection continues to expand on a worldwide basis and is becoming more complex, which will increase the risks to our business on reputational, operational, and compliance bases.\nThe continued growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that will inhibit the use of Internet-based or mobile-based communications or the information contained in these communications or the ways in which information may be collected, stored, used and transferred in the course of providing services. For example, in the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act regulates the transmission and content of commercial emails, and, among other things, obligates the sending of such emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt-out or unsubscribe and other requirements; and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act regulates the ability of certain online services to collect or use certain categories of information from children under age 13 absent parental consent. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, may decrease the expansion of the Internet or smartphone usage. A decline in the growth of the Internet or smartphone usage, particularly as it relates to online communication, could decrease demand for our services and increase our costs of doing business, or otherwise harm our business. Any new legislation or regulations, application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, mobile and other online services could increase our costs and harm our growth.\nWe anticipate making investments in, and potentially holding, creating or managing blockchain-based assets, including cryptocurrency or other digital tokens and development of blockchain-based decentralized applications (\u201cDApps\u201d), which may subject us to exchange risk and additional tax and regulatory requirements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. Under this policy, which was duly approved by our board of directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in investment instruments related to cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based assets through a newly established subsidiary. Our subsidiary is expected to contract with providers to invest in funds and/or directly hold blockchain-based, assets including cryptocurrencies such as USD\nCoin, in order to engage in investment strategies such as yield farming, which involves lending or staking cryptocurrencies to generate returns in the form of transaction fees or interest.\nThe laws surrounding cryptocurrency and blockchain-based assets are uncertain and evolving. Cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender or backed by any government, and any cryptocurrencies we may hold or related investments we may experience price volatility, technological glitches and various law enforcement and regulatory interventions. The use of cryptocurrency is currently limited both in the U.S. and around the world, and the widespread acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or means of payment for goods and services is uncertain. The application of securities laws and other regulations to cryptocurrency and blockchain-based assets is unclear, and it is possible that regulators in the U.S. or other jurisdictions may create new regulations or interpret laws in a manner that adversely affect the price of blockchain-based assets, restrict our future ability to invest in or hold blockchain-based assets and subject us to additional regulatory requirements, including laws governing payments, financial services, virtual currency, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions, privacy and data protection, tax, consumer protection, environmental protection and competition. Further, the use and development of cryptocurrency has been prohibited or effectively prohibited in some countries. If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. If any regulatory authority asserts that we require a license or other regulatory approval to conduct business involving cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-based assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we accept and hold cryptocurrency in the future, we may have exchange rate risk on the cryptocurrencies we hold as well as the risks that regulatory or other developments may adversely affect their value. We may choose not to hedge, or may be unable to fully hedge, our exposure to cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based assets and may at times be unable to convert them to U.S. dollars. If we hold cryptocurrency and its value decreases relative to our acquisition price, our financial condition may be harmed.\nMoreover, cryptocurrency and blockchain-based assets are currently considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in the asset\u2019s fair value below our carrying value for such asset at any time subsequent to its acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale, which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs. Moreover, there is no guarantee that future changes in GAAP will not require us to change the way we account for cryptocurrency held by us.\nAs intangible assets that may lack centralized issuers or governing bodies, cryptocurrencies\u2019 and blockchain-based assets\u2019 lack of a physical form, their reliance on technology for their creation, existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of security breaches, cyberattacks or other malicious activities, as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets have no physical existence beyond the record of transactions on a blockchain, a variety of technical factors related to blockchain technologies could also impact the price of cryptocurrencies and the stability of our investments. For example, malicious attacks by cryptocurrency miners, inadequate mining fees to incentivize validation of transactions, hard \u201cforks\u201d of individual blockchains into multiple blockchains, and advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry, and quantum computing could undercut the integrity of blockchain technologies and negatively affect the price of cryptocurrencies and the stability of our investments. While we intend to take all reasonable measures to secure any digital assets, if such threats are realized or the measures or controls we or our counterparties create or implement to secure our digital assets fail, it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital assets, and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nFinally, blockchain is an emerging technology that offers new capabilities which are not fully proven through sustained widespread use in the marketplace. Furthermore, the creation and use of blockchain technology and DApps in new industries will be subject to potential technical, legal and regulatory constraints. There is no warranty that blockchain-based assets and DApps will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software, network, blockchain-based assets and related technologies and theories could contain undiscovered technical flaws or weaknesses, the cryptographic security measures that authenticate transactions and the distributed ledger could be compromised, and breakdowns could cause the partial or complete inability to use or loss of blockchain-based assets or DApps.\nGlobal or local climate change and natural resource conservation regulations or requirements could adversely impact our business.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the cloud and SaaS industry remain unknown. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. In response to concerns about global climate change, governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources. Our server infrastructure consumes significant energy resources, including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels.\nOur customers, investors and other stakeholders may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business. The costs and any expenses we may incur to make our network more energy-efficient and comply with any new regulations could negatively impact our operating results. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could result in material fines and penalties, litigation, regulatory investigation and/or governmental orders requiring us to change our data practices, which could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management.\nWe have had patent and other infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products and services infringe third party intellectual property rights, and we are subject to the future risk of additional third party claims alleging infringement against us or against our customers for use of our products and services. Many of our customer and partner contracts, including certain suppliers, contain indemnification obligations requiring us to indemnify our customers from certain claims against them or arising from the use of our services. Substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. In the ordinary course of our business, our services and/or our customers\u2019 use of our services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as claims by non-practicing entities become more prevalent and the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps. Some of our competitors in the market for digital engagement technology, and/or web and mobile based consumer-facing services or other third parties may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology and have asserted and may in the future assert claims against us. Any claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant amounts in litigation (even if the claim is invalid), distract management from other tasks of operating our business, pay substantial damage awards, prevent us from selling our products, delay delivery of our services, require the development of non-infringing software, technology, business processes, systems or other intellectual property (none of which might be successful), or limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims, unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties (which may be costly, unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all). Therefore, any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depend, in part, upon the protection of our intellectual property rights relating to the technology underlying our services. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality requirements and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the U.S. and internationally and regularly file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including intellectual property related to digital engagement technology, and/or web and mobile based consumer-facing services. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products and services. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and trade names in the U.S. and in certain locations outside the U.S. We also own copyrights, including in our software, publications and other documents authored by us. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, or otherwise in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new service developments, frequent enhancements and reliable maintenance are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements (including invention assignment agreements) with our employees,\nconsultants, customers, potential customers, strategic partners, and other third parties, and through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a service with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the U.S. or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.\nThe duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of its license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be canceled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. The duration of property rights in trademarks, service marks and trade names in the U.S., whether registered or not, is predicated on our continued use.\nIt is possible that:\n\u2022any issued patent or patents issued in the future may not be broad enough to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022any issued patent or any patents issued in the future could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties, which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in the patents;\n\u2022current and future competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our services or design around any patents we may have; and\n\u2022effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.\nFurther, to the extent that the invention described in any U.S. patent was made public prior to the filing of the patent application, we may not be able to obtain patent protection in certain countries. We also rely upon copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. Any steps we might take may not be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties. Similarly, third parties may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology, processes or other intellectual property. Third parties may register marks that are confusingly similar to the trademarks or services marks that we have used in the U.S. and our failure to monitor foreign registrations or mark usage may impact out rights in certain trademarks or services marks. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the U.S. or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it. If this occurs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, disputes concerning the ownership or rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to litigate, may distract management from operating our business and may result in our loss of significant rights.\nIssues in the use of AI in our product offerings may result in reputational harm or liability.\nWe have built, and expect to continue to build, AI into many of our product offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their business activities and interactions with consumers. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be\ninsufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to legal liability and/or negative publicity for the services provided to consumers via our technology platforms.\nOur technology platforms enable representatives of our customers as well as individual service providers to communicate with consumers and other persons seeking information or advice on the web or via mobile devices. The law relating to the liability of online platform providers such as us for the activities of users of their online platforms is often challenged in the U.S. and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our technology platforms from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content via our technology platforms, or from behaving in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our technology platforms.\nClaims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law, such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, data breach, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our technology platforms. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) is intended, among other things, to reduce the liability of online service providers for transmitting or storing materials that infringe copyrights of others or referring, listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights of others. Additionally, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d), is intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who host or distribute third party content. A safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the DMCA to certain online service providers that provide specific services, if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the DMCA. There are various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections from liability for service providers in certain circumstances. Important questions regarding the safe harbor under the DMCA and the CDA have yet to be litigated, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA or of the CDA. If we are not covered by a safe harbor, for any reason, we could be exposed to claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nOur consumer service allows consumers to provide feedback regarding service providers. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of defamation or other injury could be made against us for content posted on our websites. Our liability for such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the United States where laws governing Internet or mobile transactions are unsettled.\nIf we become liable for information provided by our users and carried via our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business.\nIn addition, negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our technology platforms could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand.\nIn the future, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings, either of which could harm our business. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful services or the unlawful sale of services could harm our business. In addition to legislation and regulations relating to privacy and data security and collection, we may be subject to consumer protection laws that are enforced by regulators such as the FTC and private parties, and include statutes that regulate the collection and use of information for marketing purposes. Any new legislation or regulations regarding the Internet, mobile devices, software sales or export and/or the cloud or SaaS industry, and/or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, mobile devices, software sales\nor export and/or the cloud or SaaS industry, could create new legal or regulatory burdens on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, as we operate outside the U.S., the international regulatory environment relating to the Internet, mobile devices, software sales or export, and/or the SaaS industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our International Operations and Tax Issues\nOur results of operations may be adversely impacted due to our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in Europe, Australia, Japan and Israel. As we continue to expand our international operations we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result of the expanding size and scope of our international operations, our currency rate fluctuation risk associated with the exchange rate movement of the U.S. dollar has increased.\nSince we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a foreign currency exchange impact of approximately 1.8% percent, or approximately $8.3 million if held in constant currency, to our revenue. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies could materially affect our revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses, and result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future or to use financial instruments, such as derivative financial instruments, to mitigate risk, but we may be unable to enter into them successfully, on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, these programs rely on our ability to forecast accurately and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict whether or not we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future. To the extent the international component of our revenues grows, our results of operations will become more sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could negatively impact our business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew its membership from the E.U., which is commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Pursuant to the withdrawal arrangements entered into between the U.K. and the E.U. in connection with Brexit, the U.K. was no longer a part of the E.U. at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. While the U.K. has for the most part chosen to retain existing E.U. law and on December 24, 2020 the U.K. and E.U. agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which took provisional effect from January 1, 2020, the longer term economic, legal, political and social implications for the U.K. and the E.U. remain unclear and may lead to ongoing political, regulatory and economic uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the U.K. and in wider European markets for some time. Such uncertainty may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in the U.K. and the E.U.\nBrexit has resulted in significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business and global economic uncertainty. The continuing uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. This could negatively impact our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees.\nFurther volatility in exchange rates resulting from Brexit is expected to continue in the short term as a result of Brexit. We translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nThe longer term economic, legal, political and social implications of Brexit could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. They may also impact how we deliver our products and services to customers in the U.K. and in the E.U., which may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and/or employees and could result in increased operating expenses. In addition, Brexit could lead to further legal uncertainty and potentially divergent laws and regulations, as well as other adverse effects that we are unable to anticipate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally and/or into direct-to-consumer services due to additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latin America, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the U.K. We have also continued to invest in global messaging initiatives and in acquisitions. Our ability to continue to expand into international markets and in the online consumer market involves various risks, including the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future, or ever, and the difficulty of competing in markets with which we are unfamiliar.\nOur international operations and direct-to-consumer services may also fail due to other risks inherent in foreign and/or online consumer operations, including:\n\u2022varied, unfamiliar, unclear and changing legal and regulatory restrictions, including different legal and regulatory standards applicable to Internet or mobile services, communications, privacy, and data protection;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022differing intellectual property laws that may not provide sufficient protection for our intellectual property;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences or additional tax liabilities;\n\u2022difficulty in addressing country-specific business requirements and regulations, for instance, data privacy laws;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022strains on financial and other systems to properly administer value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and other taxes;\n\u2022different consumer preferences and requirements in specific international markets;\n\u2022international legal, compliance, political, regulatory or systemic restrictions, or other international governmental scrutiny, applicable to United States companies with sales and operations in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, possible compliance issues involving the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022local instability and shifting political, economic, and military conditions including armed conflict and terrorist activity.\nIn addition, we rely in part on third-party service providers with international operations. For example, we rely on a third-party service provider that utilizes approximately 100 engineers based in Ukraine for a portion of our engineering and software development initiatives. If this third party\u2019s operations were disrupted or discontinued due to local instability or political, economic or military conditions, then our ability to provide services to some of our current customers and the development of new products or enhancement of existing products could be delayed, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and any future international expansion plans will require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. We may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to continue expand internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, violations of any foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.\nOur operations may expose us to greater than anticipated income, non-income, and transactional tax liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is heightened scrutiny by fiscal authorities in many jurisdictions on the potential taxation of e-commerce businesses. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) has issued guidelines, referred to as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, to its member-nations aimed at encouraging broad-based legislative initiatives intended to prevent perceived base erosion transactions and income shifting in a tax-advantaged manner. Further, for the past several years, the OECD has had a specific focus on the taxation implications of e-commerce business, generally referred by the OECD as the \u201cdigital economy.\u201d In the fourth quarter of 2019, the OECD released details on its proposed approach which would, among other changes, create a new right to tax certain \u201cdigital economy\u201d income not necessarily based on traditional nexus concepts nor on the \u201carm\u2019s length principle.\u201d At this point, there is a lack of consensus among the key members, particularly the United States, with the latest OECD proposal. The United States has expressed that it would generally support a\nsolution along the lines proposed by the OECD only if the solution was in the form of a \u201csafe-harbor\u201d rather than a mandatory requirement. A failure to reach full consensus on an executable plan within the tight time frame under which the OECD is operating could result in individual jurisdictions legislating digital tax provisions in an uncoordinated and unilateral manner, and further result in greater or even double taxation that companies may not have sufficient means to remedy. For example, a number of jurisdictions, including the U.K., France and Italy, have already adopted or have formally proposed legislation that would affect the taxation of certain e-commerce businesses based on differing criteria and metrics. Efforts to alleviate this increased tax burden will increase the cost of structuring and compliance as well as the cost of doing business internationally. Any changes to the taxation of our international activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, the prospective taxation by multiple jurisdictions of e-commerce businesses could subject us to exposure to withholding, sales, VAT and/or other transaction taxes on our past and future transactions in such jurisdictions where we currently or in the future may be required to report taxable transactions. A successful assertion by any jurisdiction that we failed to pay such withholding, sales, VAT or other transaction taxes, or the imposition of new laws requiring the registration for, collection of, and payment of such taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past, current and future sales, create increased administrative burdens and costs, discourage customers from purchasing content from us, or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations. We are currently subject to and in the future may become subject to additional compliance requirements for certain of these taxes. Changes in our exposure to withholding, sales, VAT and/or other transaction taxes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition in the future.\nIn addition, an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in the matter of South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. This decision effectively reversed the 25-year-old \u201cphysical presence doctrine\u201d previously established by the Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, which required a minimum level of physical presence within a state before the state could impose an obligation to register and remit sales tax on revenue derived within that state. This decision may significantly increase the effort, resources and costs associated with the sales tax collection and compliance burden. Since the decision, a number of states have enacted sales tax enabling legislation which has had the effect of significantly expanding the liability of e-commerce companies to register, collect and remit state sales taxes from customers. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $553.4 million which are available to offset future federal taxable income. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset post-change taxable income. Under Section 382 of the Code, our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code, or as a result of a corresponding provision of state law. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Federal NOLs generated in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017, are eligible to be carried forward for up to 20 tax years (and carried back up to two tax years) following their incurrence. Federal NOLs generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, are eligible to be carried forward indefinitely, but generally may only offset up to 80% of federal taxable income earned in a taxable year. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $78.2 million of our approximately $553.4 million of federal NOLs were generated in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017. If our ability to utilize federal NOLs were limited by Section 382 of the Code, it could result in NOLs generated on or before December 31, 2017, expiring unused. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our maintaining profitability in the future and generating U.S. federal taxable income. Since we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income necessary to utilize our remaining NOLs, our NOLs generated on or prior to December 31, 2017 could expire unused.\nPolitical, economic, and military conditions in Israel could negatively impact our Israeli operations.\nA substantial portion of our product development staff, help desk and online sales support operations are located in Israel. As of December 31, 2021, we had 204 full-time employees in Israel. Although substantially all of our sales to date have been made to customers outside Israel, we are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, Hamas (an Islamist militia and political group that controls the Gaza Strip), Hezbollah (an Islamist militia and political group based in Lebanon) and other armed groups. Furthermore, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and may be developing nuclear weapons.\nIn addition, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subject to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or the expansion of our business. A campaign of boycotts, divestment, and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also adversely affect our business. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nParties with whom we do business may sometimes decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.\nFurther, shifting economic and political conditions in the U.S. and in other countries may result in changes in how the U.S. and other countries conduct business and other relations with Israel, which may have an adverse impact on our Israeli operations and a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur commercial insurance may not cover losses that could occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect our business and could harm our results of operations.\nContinued hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our securities. In addition, escalation of tensions or violence might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our Israeli employees and might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and our business.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\nIn March 2019, we issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 in a private placement. The interest rate on the 2024 Notes is fixed at 0.75% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. In December 2020, we issued $517.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 in a private placement. The 2026 Notes do not bear any regular interest payments.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our Notes or any additional future indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our current or any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may\ncontain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the maturity date at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we are required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or any agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash upon conversions of Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Notes.\nProvisions in the indentures for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\nIf a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior the maturity date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indentures for the Notes prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the indentures governing the Notes could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to you.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component, net of issuance costs, is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the liability component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 \u201cDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options\u201d and ASC Subtopic 815-40 \u201cHedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d that changes the accounting for the convertible debt instruments described above. Under the new standard, an entity may no longer separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. Additionally, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments the principal amount of which may be settled using shares. Rather, the \u201cif-converted\u201d method may be required. Application of the \u201cif converted\u201d method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. We cannot be sure whether other changes may be made to the accounting standards related to the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes, or otherwise, that could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the transaction in which we issued the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, upon any conversion of Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates are expected to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock, the Notes or other of our securities or instruments (if any), in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any earlier conversion or any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect a holder\u2019s ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that a holder will receive upon conversion of such Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Notes (and as a result, the amount and value of the consideration that a holder would receive upon the conversion of any Notes) and, under certain circumstances, a holder\u2019s ability to convert his or her Notes.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock or the Notes. In addition, we do not make any representation that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe option counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them may default under the capped calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure depends on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, which could reduce the value of your investment and subject us to litigation.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to be highly volatile, with extreme price and volume fluctuations. Our trading price could fluctuate substantially in the future, including in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022quarterly variations in our operating results or those of our competitors;\n\u2022earnings announcements that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022announcements or rumors about mergers or strategic acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022announcements about customer additions and cancellations or failure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022our exposure, or perceptions or misperceptions of our exposure to cryptocurrencies;\n\u2022consequences of unexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, acts of war or climate change;\n\u2022pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns; and\n\u2022general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, political unrest or terrorist attacks, or in the specific locations where we operate, such as the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally, and in the markets for technology companies in particular, could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation, which could result in substantial costs and distract management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur common stock is traded on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq and the TASE. Trading in our common stock on these markets takes place in different currencies (U.S. dollars on the Nasdaq and New Israeli Shekels on the TASE) and at different times (due to different time zones, trading days and public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our common stock on these two markets may differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in the trading price of our common stock on one of these markets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock on the other market. Differences in trading prices on the two markets could negatively impact our trading price.\nIf our officers, directors, and largest stockholders choose to act together, they may be able to significantly influence our management and operations, acting in their own best interest and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately 40.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders could also delay or prevent a change in control. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with LivePerson\u2019s interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nIf we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, or upon the conversion of the Notes, in the public market, or if the market perceives that these sales might occur, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that market sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management that stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at any annual meeting;\n\u2022Vacancies on our board of directors may only be filled by a vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors or any other matters. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022Our stockholders may only act at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not act by written consent;\n\u2022Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors or to propose other matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022We require supermajority voting by stockholders to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and to amend our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022Our amended and restated bylaws expressly authorize a supermajority of the board of directors to amend our amended and restated bylaws.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. This anti-takeover provision defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that any stock repurchase programs will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nRepurchases pursuant to any stock repurchase program that we may enter could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, repurchases under a stock repurchase program would diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.", "PERMNO": 88174, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LPSN"}
