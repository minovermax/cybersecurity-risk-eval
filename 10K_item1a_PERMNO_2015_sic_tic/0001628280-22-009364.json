{"cik": "1043000", "company": "SONIDA SENIOR LIVING, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business involves various risks and uncertainties. When evaluating our business, the following information should be carefully considered in conjunction with the other information contained in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us currently or that currently we deem to be immaterial also may impair our business operations. Immediately below is a summary of the principal factors that might cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks facing us. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in the \u201cRisk Factors Summary,\u201d as well as other risks that may affect our business and operating results, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d and should be carefully considered and evaluated before making an investment decision regarding our business. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from occurring, then our business may suffer. Negative events are likely to decrease our revenue, increase our costs, negatively impact our financial results and/or decrease our financial strength and may cause our stock price to decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 has had a significant adverse impact on occupancy levels, revenues, expenses and operating results at our communities. Because we are unable to predict the full nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 at this time, COVID-19 may continue to have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis. COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency in the United States in response to the outbreak and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that older adults are at a higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19. The United States broadly continues to experience the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly disrupted the nation\u2019s economy, the senior living industry and our business.\nIn an effort to protect our residents and employees and slow the spread of COVID-19 and in response to quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other limitations imposed by federal, state and local governments, we previously restricted or limited access to our communities, including limitations on in-person prospective resident tours and, in certain cases, new resident admissions. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in the occupancy levels at our communities that has negatively impacted our revenues and operating results, which depend significantly on such occupancy levels. From March 2020 through February 2021, our occupancy decreased 760 basis points. While our occupancy after such time increased 630 basis points from February 2021 through December 2021, we cannot predict with reasonable certainty whether demand for our senior living communities will return to pre-COVID-19 levels or the extent to which the pandemic\u2019s effect on demand may adversely affect the amount of resident fee revenue we are able to collect from our residents.\nAs of December 31, 2021, all of our senior living communities were open for new resident move-ins. Although vaccines are now widely available, we cannot predict the duration of the pandemic or its ongoing impact on our business. If the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, including the risk of transmission of highly contagious variants of the COVID-19 virus, we may have to impose or revert to restricted or limited access to our communities, which could negatively impact our revenues and operating results depending upon the extent and duration of such restricted or limited access.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has required us to incur significant additional operating costs and expenses in order to care for our residents. Further, residents at certain of our senior housing communities have tested positive for COVID-19, which has increased the costs of caring for the residents at such communities and has resulted in reduced occupancies at such communities. Since March 2020, we have incurred incremental direct costs to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes $1.9 million and $9.4 million, respectively, of incremental and direct costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic including costs for acquisition of additional personal protective equipment, cleaning and disposable food service supplies, testing of our residents and employees, enhanced cleaning and environmental sanitation costs, and increased labor expense. We are unable to reasonably predict the total amount of costs we will ultimately incur related to the pandemic and such costs are likely to be substantial.\nFurther, the grants received by us from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund are subject to the terms and conditions of the program, including that such funds may only be used to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19. Such grants will reimburse only for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to COVID-19 and have not been reimbursed from other sources or that other sources are not obligated to reimburse. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services continues to evaluate and provide regulation and guidance regarding grants made under the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. We cannot provide assurance that additional restrictions on the permissible uses or terms and conditions of the grants will not be imposed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program requires us to report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on our use of the grants, and our reporting is subject to audit.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused substantial volatility in the market prices and trading volumes in the equity markets, including our stock. Our stock price and trading volume may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of the pandemic and may decline in the future.\nThe ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and stock price will depend on many factors. Some factors cannot be foreseen, including the duration, severity and geographic concentrations of the pandemic and any resurgence of the disease or the emergence of new variants; the impact of COVID-19 on the nation\u2019s economy and debt and equity markets and the local economies in our markets; the development, availability and efficacy of COVID-19 infection and antibody testing, therapeutic agents and vaccines and the prioritization of such resources among businesses and demographic groups; government financial and regulatory relief efforts that may become available to business and individuals; perceptions regarding the safety of senior living communities during and after the pandemic; changes in demand for senior living communities and our ability to adapt our sales and marketing efforts to meet that demand; the impact of COVID-19 on our residents\u2019 and their families\u2019 ability to afford our resident fees, including due to changes in unemployment rates, consumer confidence and equity markets caused by COVID-19; changes in the acuity levels of our new residents; the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on seniors generally and those residing in our communities; the duration and costs of our preparation and response efforts, including increased supplies, labor, litigation, and other expenses; the impact of COVID-19 on our ability to complete financings, re-financings and/or other transactions (including dispositions) or to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required debt service payments and to satisfy financial and other covenants in our debt and lease documents; increased regulatory requirements and enforcement actions resulting from COVID-19, including those that may limit our collection efforts for delinquent accounts; and the frequency and magnitude of legal actions and liability claims that may arise due to COVID-19 or our response efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Indebtedness\nWe have significant debt and our failure to generate cash flow sufficient to cover required interest and principal payments could result in defaults of the related debt.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had mortgage and other indebtedness, excluding deferred loan costs, totaling approximately $687.3 million. We cannot assure you that we will generate cash flow from operations or receive proceeds from refinancing activities, other financings and/or the sales of assets sufficient to cover required interest and principal payments. Any payment or other default could cause the applicable lender to foreclose upon the communities securing the indebtedness with a consequent loss of income and asset value to us. Further, because some of our mortgages contain cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions, a payment or other default by us with respect to one community could affect a significant number of our other communities.\nWe may require additional financing and/or refinancing actions in the future and may issue equity securities.\nOur ability to obtain such financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. For example, in November 2021, we issued and sold shares of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by the A&R Investment Agreement. Our ability to meet our long-term capital requirements, including the repayment of certain long-term debt obligations, will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancings on acceptable terms from available financing sources, including through the use of mortgage financing, joint venture arrangements, by accessing the debt and/or equity markets and possibly through operating leases or other types of financing, such as lines of credit. Turmoil in the financial markets can severely restrict the availability of funds for borrowing and may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital. There can be no assurance that financing or refinancings will be available or that, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities could cause existing stockholders to experience dilution and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For example, the transactions consummated pursuant to the A&R Investment Agreement resulted in dilution to existing stockholders. Disruptions in the financial markets may have a significant adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us and our business. Our inability to obtain additional financing or refinancings on terms acceptable to us could delay or eliminate some or all of our growth plans, necessitate the sales of assets at unfavorable prices or both, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIncreases in market interest rates could significantly increase the costs of our floating rate debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings.\nOur floating rate debt obligations and any future indebtedness, if applicable, exposes us to interest rate risk. Therefore, any increase in prevailing interest rates could increase our future interest obligations, which could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe phasing out of LIBOR may increase the interest costs of our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe interest rates for certain of our variable-rate debt obligations are calculated based on the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus a spread. LIBOR is regulated by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which intends to phase out the LIBOR tenors by June 30, 2023. These debt obligations may be extended or we may enter into new variable interest rate debt obligations based on LIBOR. To the extent that LIBOR is discontinued, the terms of such variable-rate debt agreements may provide that the lender will have the right to choose an alternative index based on comparable information. It is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve by the applicable phase out dates, or whether alternative and comparable index rates will be established and adopted by our lenders and other financial institutions. To the extent LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change, interest rates on any such variable-rate debt obligations may increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Strategy\nWe have incurred losses from operations in each of the last three fiscal years and may do so in the future.\nWe generated net income in 2021 that primarily resulted from a gain recognized on the extinguishment of debt. We incurred net losses in each of fiscal years 2020 and 2019. While improved from prior years, the Company currently has limited resources and substantial debt obligations. Given our history of losses and current industry conditions, it is not certain that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operations in the future, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to fund our operations and fulfill our debt obligations.\nWe largely rely on private pay residents and circumstances that adversely affect the ability of the seniors to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 90.4% of our total resident revenues from communities that we operated were attributable to private pay sources and approximately 9.6% of our resident revenues from these communities were attributable to reimbursements from Medicaid, in each case, during fiscal year 2021. We expect to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for our services from their own or family financial resources. Unfavorable economic conditions in the housing, financial and credit markets, inflation, or other circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe senior living services industry is very competitive and some competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than us.\nThe senior living services industry is highly competitive, and we expect that all segments of the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. We compete with other companies providing independent living, assisted living, home health care and other similar services and care alternatives. We also compete with other health care businesses with respect to attracting and retaining nurses, technicians, aides and other high-quality professional and non-professional employees and managers. Although we believe there is a need for senior housing communities in the markets where we operate residences, we expect that competition will increase from existing competitors and new market entrants, some that may have substantially greater financial resources than us. In addition, some of our competitors operate on a not-for-profit basis or as charitable organizations and have the ability to finance capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or through the receipt of charitable contributions, neither of which are available to us. Furthermore, if the development of new senior housing communities outpaces the demand for those communities in the markets in which we have senior housing communities, those markets may become saturated. Regulation in the independent and assisted living industry is not substantial. Consequently, development of new senior housing communities could outpace demand. An oversupply of those communities in our markets could cause us to experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability.\nTermination of resident agreements and resident attrition could affect adversely our revenues and earnings.\nState regulations governing assisted living facilities require written resident agreements with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, the resident agreements signed by us allow residents to terminate their lease upon 0 to 30 days\u2019 notice. Thus, we cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or longer. Our resident agreements generally provide for termination of the lease upon death or allow a resident to terminate their lease upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the community. In addition, the advanced age of our average resident means that the resident turnover rate in our senior living facilities may be difficult to predict. If a large number of residents elected to or otherwise terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2021. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in previous filings for the year ended December 31, 2020, and for the quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Due to challenges in maintaining necessary accounting staffing levels, this material weakness has not been remediated during the quarter ended and the year ended December 31, 2021. Our financial statement close process controls, which relate to all financial statement accounts, did not operate effectively to ensure account reconciliations and journal entries were performed or reviewed at the appropriate level of precision and on a timely basis. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.\nWe have developed a plan for remediation of the material weakness, including developing and maintaining appropriate management review and process level controls. Control weaknesses are not considered remediated until new internal controls have been operational for a period of time, have been tested and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our remediation measures in connection with our future assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nThere is an inherent risk of liability in the provision of personal and health care services, not all of which may be covered by insurance.\nThe provision of personal and health care services in the long-term care industry entails an inherent risk of liability. In recent years, participants in the long-term care industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence or related legal theories, many of which involve large claims and result in the incurrence of significant defense costs. Moreover, senior housing communities offer residents a greater degree of independence in their daily living. This increased level of independence may subject the resident and, therefore, us to risks that would be reduced in more institutionalized settings. We currently maintain insurance in amounts we believe are comparable to those maintained by other senior living companies based on the nature of the risks and our historical experience and industry standards. We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate. However, we may become subject to claims in excess of our insurance or claims not covered by our insurance, such as claims for punitive damages, terrorism and natural disasters. A claim against us not covered by, or in excess of, our insurance limits could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, our insurance policies must be renewed annually. Based upon poor loss experience and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, insurers for the long-term care industry have become increasingly wary of liability exposure. A number of insurance carriers have stopped writing coverage to this market or reduced the level of coverage offered, and those remaining have increased premiums and deductibles substantially. The COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage or increase the costs of doing so. Therefore, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future or that, if that insurance is available, it will be available on acceptable economic terms.\nDamage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses and adversely affect certain of our residents.\nA certain number of our properties are located in areas that have experienced and may experience in the future catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including snow or ice storms, windstorm, tornados, hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. These events could result in some of our communities losing access to electricity, gas, water and other utilities for a period of time, and could also result in increased electricity and other utility expenses. Damage to facilities or loss of power or water could adversely impact our residents and result in a decline in occupancy at our communities. We maintain insurance policies, including coverage for business interruption, designed to mitigate financial losses resulting from such adverse weather and natural events. However, there can be no assurance that adverse weather or natural events will not cause substantial damages or losses to our communities that could exceed our insurance coverage. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nDamage to facilities or loss of power or water could adversely impact our residents and result in a decline in occupancy at our communities.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information technology and computer systems, or to prevent a cybersecurity attack, breach or other unauthorized access, could adversely affect our business, reputation and relationships with our residents, employees and referral sources and may subject us to remediation costs, government inquiries and liabilities under HIPAA and data and consumer protection laws, any of which could materially and adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe rely upon the proper function and availability of our information technology and computer systems, including hardware, software, applications and electronic data storage, to communicate with our residents and patients, their doctors and other healthcare providers, and our employees and vendors and to store, process, safeguard and transmit our business information, including proprietary business information, private health information and personally identifiable information of our residents and employees. We have taken steps and expended significant resources to protect the cybersecurity and physical security of our information technology and computer systems and have developed and implemented policies and procedures to comply with HIPAA and other applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our security measures, policies and procedures and disaster recovery plans will prevent damage to, or interruption or breach of, our information systems or other unauthorized access to private information.\nThe cybersecurity risks to our Company and our third-party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the frequently changing techniques used to illegally or fraudulently obtain unauthorized access to systems, advances in computing technology and cryptography and the possibility that unauthorized access may be difficult to detect, which could lead to us or our vendors being unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, components of our information systems that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security or functionality of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business or communicate, through computer viruses, hacking, fraud or other forms of deceiving our employees or contractors such as email phishing attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our cybersecurity or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities, attacks or incidents.\nIn addition, we rely on software support of third parties to secure and maintain our information systems and data. Our inability, or the inability of these third parties, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems, or to prevent a cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized access to our information systems, could expose us to a number of adverse consequences, including: (i) interruptions to our business and operations; (ii) the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our residents, patients and employees; (iii) significant remediation costs; (iv) negative publicity that could damage our reputation and our relationships with our residents, patients, employees and referral sources; (v) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws, including HIPAA, or other applicable laws, rules or regulations; and (vi) government inquiries that may result in sanctions and other criminal or civil fines or penalties. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nBecause we do not presently have plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nIt is the policy of our board of directors to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we have not and do not currently anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on your common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, operations, capital requirements, financial condition, restrictions in then existing financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nWe rely on the services of key executive officers and the transition of management or loss of these officers or their services could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers for our management. We have recently undergone changes in our senior management and may experience further changes in the future. The transition of management, loss of any of our executive officers or our inability to attract and retain qualified management personnel in the future, could affect our ability to manage our business and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA significant increase in our labor costs or labor shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe compete with other providers of senior living services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our communities and skilled personnel responsible for providing resident care. We rely upon the quality of our staff as a means to differentiate our services from other providers. A shortage of nurses or trained personnel may require us to enhance our wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of these personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. We also will be dependent on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. No assurance can be given that our labor costs will not increase, or that, if they do increase, they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents. Any significant failure by us to control our labor costs or to pass on any increased labor costs to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. During 2021, we experienced pressures associated with the highly competitive labor environment, including increased personnel turnover, engaging costly contract and/or temporary staffing and lengthening timeframes for filling open positions.\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision for employee health care benefits and future health care reform legislation.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for employee health care plans. We record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs and stop-loss premiums. These estimates are then adjusted to reflect actual costs incurred. Actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics, the actual costs of claims and whether stop-loss insurance covers these claims. In the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) expanded health care coverage to millions of previously uninsured people beginning in 2014 and has resulted in significant changes to the United States health care system. This comprehensive health care legislation has resulted and will continue to result in extensive rule making by regulatory authorities, and also may be altered, amended, repealed or replaced. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to the complexity of the law and implementing regulations, as well our inability to foresee how participants in the health care industry will respond to the choices available to them under the law. The provisions of the legislation and other regulations implementing the provisions of the Affordable Care Act or any amended or replacement legislation may increase our costs, adversely affect our revenues, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business.\nIn addition to its impact on the delivery and payment for healthcare, the Affordable Care Act and the implementing regulations have resulted and may continue to result in increases to our costs to provide health care benefits to our employees. We also may be required to make additional employee-related changes to our business as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act or any amended or replacement legislation impacting the provision of health insurance by employers, which could result in additional expense and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Compliance and/or Legal Matters\nWe are subject to governmental regulations and compliance, some of which are burdensome and some of which may change to our detriment in the future.\nFederal and state governments regulate various aspects of our business. The development and operation of senior housing communities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws that regulate, among other matters, the number of licensed beds, the provision of services, the distribution of pharmaceuticals, billing practices and policies, equipment, staffing (including professional licensing), operating policies and procedures, fire prevention measures, environmental matters and compliance with building and safety codes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement, the imposition of fines, temporary suspension of admission of new residents, suspension or loss of certification from the Medicaid program, restrictions on the ability to acquire new communities or expand existing communities and, in extreme cases, the revocation of a community\u2019s license or closure of a community. We believe that such regulation will increase in the future and we are unable to predict the content of new regulations or their effect on our business, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nVarious states, including several of the states in which we currently operate, control the supply of licensed beds and assisted living communities through a Certification of Need (\"CON\") requirement or other programs. In those states, approval is required for the addition of licensed beds and some capital expenditures at those communities. To the extent that a CON or other similar approval is required for the acquisition or construction of new communities, the expansion of the number of licensed beds, services or existing communities, we could be adversely affected by our failure or inability to obtain that approval, changes in the standards applicable for that approval and possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining that approval. In addition, in most states, the reduction of the number of licensed beds or the closure of a community requires the approval of the appropriate state regulatory agency. If we were to seek to reduce the number of licensed beds at, or to close, a community, we could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain or a delay in obtaining that approval.\nFederal and state anti-remuneration laws, such as \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws, govern some financial arrangements among health care providers and others who may be in a position to refer or recommend patients to those providers. These laws prohibit, among other things, some direct and indirect payments that are intended to induce the referral of patients to, the arranging for services by, or the recommending of, a particular provider of health care items or services. Federal anti-kickback laws have been broadly interpreted to apply to some contractual relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral. Similar state laws vary, are sometimes vague and seldom have been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies. Violation of these laws can result in loss of licensure, civil and criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from participation in the Medicaid program. There can be no assurance that those laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional federal, state and local laws exist that also may require modifications to existing and planned communities to create access to the properties by disabled persons. We believe that our communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements or are exempt therefrom. However, if required changes involve a greater expenditure than anticipated or must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, additional costs would be incurred by us. Further legislation may impose additional burdens or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons and the costs of compliance could be substantial.\nHIPAA, in conjunction with the federal regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has established, among other requirements, standards governing the privacy of certain protected and individually identifiable health information that is created, received or maintained by a range of covered entities. HIPAA has also established standards governing uniform health care transactions, the codes and identifiers to be used by the covered entities and standards governing the security of certain electronic transactions conducted by covered entities. Penalties for violations can range from civil money penalties for errors and negligent acts to criminal fines and imprisonment for knowing and intentional misconduct. HIPAA is a complex set of regulations and many unanswered questions remain with respect to the manner in which HIPAA applies to businesses such as those operated by us.\nIn addition, some states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data protection or transparency. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became effective in 2020, and we expect additional federal and state legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate consumer privacy protection in the future. Compliance with such legislative and regulatory developments could be burdensome and costly, and the failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAn increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in recent years that would result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or a state level. Among the proposals that have been introduced are price controls on hospitals, insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses, requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of government health insurance plans that would cover all citizens and increase payments by beneficiaries. We cannot predict whether any of the above proposals or other proposals will be adopted and, if adopted, no assurances can be given that their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, for example, those that govern occupational health and safety requirements, wage and hour requirements, equal employment opportunity obligations, leaves of absence and reasonable accommodations, employee benefits and the right of employees to engage in protected concerted activity (including union organizing). Because labor represents such a large portion of our operating expenses, changes in federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws can result in significant protracted litigation, government investigation, penalties or other damages that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may be subject to liability for environmental damages.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of the substances may be substantial, and the presence of the substances, or the failure to properly remediate the property, may adversely affect the owner\u2019s ability to sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of the substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. Finally, the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. If we become subject to any of these claims, the costs involved could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Organization and Structure:\nAnti-takeover provisions in our governing documents, governing law and material agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated By-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts, including: a staggered board of directors consisting of three classes of directors, each of whom serve three-year terms; removal of directors only for cause, and only with the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote; right of our directors to issue preferred stock from time to time with voting, economic and other rights superior to those of our common stock without the consent of our stockholders; provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws limiting the right of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; advance notice requirements for stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings; requirement for two-thirds stockholder approval for amendment of our by-laws and certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation; and no provision in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election.\nSeveral of our loan documents and other material agreements require approval in the event we undergo a change of control of our Company. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company even if this change of control would benefit our stockholders.\nIn addition to the anti-takeover provisions described above, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 generally prohibits a person beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in a business combination with us for three years after the person acquired the stock. However, this prohibition does not apply if (A) our directors approve in advance the person\u2019s ownership of 15% or more of the shares or the business combination or (B) the business combination is approved by our stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares not owned by the acquiring person.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of our common stock, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn November 2021, we issued 41,250 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to affiliates of Conversant Capital LLC. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are generally entitled to vote with the holders of our common stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of common stock (voting together with the holders of shares of common stock as one class) on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2021, the Conversant Investors collectively owned a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding securities.\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, on November 3, 2021, Conversant Fund A became entitled to designate four individuals to be appointed to the Company\u2019s board of directors, including the Chairperson, and Silk became entitled to designate two individuals to be appointed to the Company\u2019s board of directors, in each case so long as they and their respective permitted transferees and affiliates maintain minimum aggregate holdings of our stock as described in further detail in the Investor Rights Agreement. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors are subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of Conversant Fund A or Silk director designees may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nAdditionally, the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is required in order for us to take certain actions, including issuances of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock, and incurrence of indebtedness in excess of a certain amount. As a result, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock may in the future have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization.\nAs a result, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock may in the future have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, and the conversion of those shares into shares of our common stock would dilute the ownership of common stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, which reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. In addition, the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading, which could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a payment on account of the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock. In addition, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 11.0% per annum, compounding quarterly.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights, including the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock upon prior written notice of certain change of control events for a repurchase price equal to the greater of (i) the proceeds that would have been received in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in such change of control if they were converted into common stock immediately prior to such change of control and (ii) an amount in cash equal to 100% of the then-current liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on loans, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and have no obligation to make funds available to us.\nRisks Related to Other Market Factors\nFuture offerings of equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have increased, and may again in the future, attempt to increase, our capital resources by offering additional equity securities. Additional equity offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders and/or reduce the market price of our common stock. Our decision to issue equity securities in a future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their holdings in our Company. Further, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement between the Company and the Conversant Investors in compliance with certain agreements to which the Company is a party, we are required to register the resale of shares of common stock that are either outstanding or issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock or convertible notes. The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While we cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of our common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of our securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially over the past several years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, which are described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those factors discussed under this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Some of these factors are beyond our control. We may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or securities analysts at some point in the future, and our stock price could decline as a result. This volatility may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock.\nVarious factors, including general economic conditions, could adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business.\nGeneral economic conditions, such as inflation, the consumer price index, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs, competition in the labor market, costs of salaries, wages, benefits and insurance, interest rates and tax rates, affect our facility operating, facility lease, general and administrative and other expense. We have no control or limited ability to control such factors. Current global economic conditions and uncertainties, the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our business partners, landlords, counterparties and residents or prospective residents in an adverse manner including, but not limited to, reducing access to liquid funds or credit increasing the cost of credit, limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk, increasing the risk that certain of our business partners, landlords or counterparties would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us, and other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate.", "PERMNO": 85419, "SIC": 8300, "TIC": "CSU"}
