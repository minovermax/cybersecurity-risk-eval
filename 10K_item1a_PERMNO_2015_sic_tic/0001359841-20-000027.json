{"cik": "1359841", "company": "Hanesbrands Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on the trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future.\nThe basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition generally is based upon brand, comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large domestic and foreign corporations and manufacturers, as well as mass merchant retailers, department stores and other retailers, including many of our customers, that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. Also, online retail shopping is rapidly evolving, and we expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices, in each case decreasing our cash\nflows, operating margins and profitability. Our ability to identify and capitalize on retail trends, including technology, e-commerce and other process efficiencies to gain market share and better service our customer base will, in large part, determine our future success. If we fail to compete successfully, our market share, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe rapidly changing retail environment could result in the loss of or material reduction in sales to certain of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe retail environment is highly competitive. Consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a greater portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers is occurring online and through mobile commerce applications. If our brick-and-mortar retail customers fail to maintain or grow their overall market position through the integration of physical retail presence and digital retail, these customers may experience financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could, in turn, create difficulty in moving our products to market, which would increase inventories or backlog, substantially reduce our revenues, increase our credit risk and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAny inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security breach with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and support global growth and expansion, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business.\nDespite our policies, procedures and programs designed to ensure the integrity of our information technology systems, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. Furthermore, from time to time we rely on information technology systems which may be managed, hosted, provided and/or accessed by third parties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business. Such relationships and access may create difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after a breach.\nHackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex attacks that may include computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks and large-scale automated attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. Any breach of our network or databases, or those of our third-party providers, may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, impair our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits.\nMoreover, there are numerous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure and protection of personal data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between states within a country or between countries. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective on May 25, 2018, and has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies with users and operations in the European Union and European Economic Area. Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations. We have significant operations in the European Economic Area and are subject to the GDPR. The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and could make it more difficult and/or more costly for us to use and share personal data. Further, following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the European Union. This has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear whether the United Kingdom will enact data protection laws or regulations designed to be consistent with GDPR and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. In addition, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020, and limits how we may collect and use personal data. The effects of the CCPA potentially are far-reaching, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of a data security incident. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers\u2019 business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers\u2019 business,\nresults of operations or financial condition. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings, and potentially significant monetary penalties, against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nSignificant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs, such as cotton and oil-related materials, utilities, freight and wages, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, including cotton, dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. In addition, sudden decreases in the costs for materials may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production, which could result in lower profitability, particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure. If, in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies, or if our competitors\u2019 unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our senior management team and other key personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel, some of whom have unique talents and experience that would be difficult to replace. The loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position. Our future success will also depend on our ability to develop and/or recruit employees with the core competencies needed to support our growth in global markets and in new products or services. We may not be able to attract or retain these employees, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur failure to properly manage strategic projects in order to achieve the desired results may negatively impact our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex projects, which places significant demands on our management, accounting, financial, information and other systems and on our business. Our ability to successfully implement such projects is dependent on management\u2019s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to our changing business needs. We cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage these projects effectively or implement them successfully. If we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nDue to the extensive nature of our foreign operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.\nA growing percentage of our total revenues (approximately 36% in 2019) is derived from markets outside the United States. We sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase many of our raw materials, pay a portion of our wages and make other payments to participants in our supply chain in foreign currencies. As a result, when the U.S. dollar weakens against any of these currencies, our cost of sales could increase substantially. Outside the United States, we may pay for materials or finished products in U.S. dollars, and in some cases a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the U.S. dollars we need to make such payments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe use forward foreign exchange contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and nonderivative financial instruments to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk.\nWe rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn 2019, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 40% of our total net sales and our top two customers, Wal-Mart and Target, accounted for 14% and 11% of our total net sales, respectively. We expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future. Moreover, our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines. We generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products, and as a result, most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis. A decision by any of our top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products, our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business. Any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur operations in international markets, and our earnings in those markets, may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nDuring 2019, net sales from our International segment were $2.5 billion, representing approximately 36% of total net sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located, or our products are sourced from, outside the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in tariffs, taxes or regulatory requirements, and political unrest and corruption.\nRegulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell, produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when, after we have moved our operations to a particular location, new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changed.\nCountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from a particular country;\n\u2022\nrequirements as to where products and/or inputs are manufactured or sourced;\n\u2022\ncreation of export licensing requirements, imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing and/or export prices or duties;\n\u2022\nlimitations on foreign owned businesses; or\n\u2022\ngovernment actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets.\nIn addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-corruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nThe recent imposition of tariffs and/or increase in tariffs on various products by the United States and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. Furthermore, it is possible that other forms of trade restriction, including tariffs, quotas and customs restrictions, will be put into place in the United States or in countries from which we source our materials or finished products. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. Any of these actions, if ultimately enacted, could adversely affect our results of operations or profitability. Further, any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the\ntrade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the ongoing negotiations surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) have yet to provide clarity on what the outcome will be for the United Kingdom or Europe. Changes related to Brexit could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have a complex multinational tax structure, and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our results.\nWe have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing agreements is subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. We are continuously evaluating our capital allocation strategies in an effort to maximize shareholder value, which includes maintaining appropriate debt to earnings ratios, and as a result there may be times where we need to reevaluate our plans to permanently reinvest certain unremitted foreign earnings which may increase or decrease our income tax expense during periods of change. In addition, we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, as well as our capital deployment strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised United States corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, introducing a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) and implementing a modified territorial tax system that included a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings from foreign subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting as it relates to the enactment of the Tax Act pursuant to the guidance set forth in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) and accounted for the tax provisions of the Tax Act which became effective in 2018. The actual impact of the Tax Act may differ from amounts recorded to date as further guidance and regulations continue to be issued to further clarify and help taxpayers interpret various components of the Tax Act.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, our brands and operating results could be harmed. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this evaluation, management identified control deficiencies that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to the accounting for the existence and accuracy of income taxes. Because of this material weakness identified in 2019, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, this material weakness resulted in a revision to our annual and interim consolidated financial statements in 2018 and 2017 and our interim financial statements in 2019. Accordingly, impacted financial statements have been revised in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement has and will continue to enhance its internal control over financial reporting, which is expected to include refinements and enhancements to the design and operation of our controls related to income taxes. Enhancements made to certain of our controls related to income taxes during 2019 contributed to the identification of the errors which impacted prior periods that have been corrected as disclosed in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company intends to implement these enhancements to the design and operation of our controls during 2020. However, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. We will monitor the effectiveness of the remediation plan and will refine the remediation plan, as needed. Until remediated, this material weakness could result in future errors to our financial statements. However, we can give no assurance that the measures we take will remediate the material weakness or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weakness, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our products.\nWe are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory levels with our ability to meet marketplace needs. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings, as well as unanticipated changes in general economic conditions or other factors, which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers.\nInventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain, a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products. We sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers, and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods. As a result, we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with third-party manufacturers before our customers\u2019 orders are firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, sudden decreases in the costs for materials may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production; if this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow, particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory. Excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses, lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands. If the reputation of one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\nMany of our brands have worldwide recognition, and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of a brand can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation or the sale of counterfeit products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including changing consumer attitudes regarding social issues and consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, its practices or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands.\nWe also license some of our important trademarks to third parties. For example, we license Champion to third parties for athletic-oriented accessories. Although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees, there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with\nthose mechanisms and obligations. If the reputation of one or more of our brands is significantly eroded, it could adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our business.\nWe purchase all of the raw materials used in our self-manufactured products and our sourced finished goods from a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third-party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions, production problems, difficulties in sourcing raw materials, lack of capacity or transportation disruptions, or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them. The magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions, the materials or products that the third-party manufacturers provide and the volume of production.\nOur dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products. Quality failures by our third-party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our business.\nOur customers may require products on an exclusive basis, forms of economic support and other changes that could be harmful to our business.\nCustomers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis, which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units, or \u201cSKUs,\u201d we must carry and, consequently, increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements. Moreover, our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support, which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability. Our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the False Claims Act, the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Global Data Protection Regulation, securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations), unclaimed property laws and many others. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and, depending on the circumstances, subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market value of our stock.\nEconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers, suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels, reduced orders to us or order cancellations. These lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods,\nlogistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions. In addition, the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. If third parties on which we rely for raw materials, finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nGoodwill, trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. The fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes. If the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill and $1.5 billion of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet, which together represent 37% of our total assets. No impairment was identified in 2019. Changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.\nWe have a complex global supply chain and distribution network that supports our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, tsunami, terrorist attack, pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other systems and operations. Climate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations. Therefore, forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative.\nWhile our operational size, the diversity of locations from which we operate, and our redundant back-up systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. All of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf our advertising, marketing and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our sales could be negatively affected.\nIneffective marketing, advertising and promotional programs could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales. While we use social media, websites, mobile applications, email, print and television to promote our products and attract customers, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets. Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had approximately $95 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, which represents approximately 1% of our total assets. Deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences (differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income). The recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized. Changes in effective tax rates and the assumptions and estimates we have made, as well as our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, could result in a write\ndown of deferred tax assets or otherwise materially affect our tax obligations or effective tax rate, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe design, manufacture, source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties. If any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company reputational harm, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe design, manufacture, source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties, such as our Polo Ralph Lauren men\u2019s underwear. Because we do not control the brands licensed to us, our licensors could make changes to their brands or business models that could result in a significant downturn in a brand\u2019s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. If any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm, or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand\u2019s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations, and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations, advertising and, possibly, legal fees.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect these trademarks from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures, including court actions and administrative proceedings. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights. Infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our business. Actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the United States or other countries, such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights.\nThe value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. We are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual property.\nWe may suffer negative publicity if we or our third-party manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal, which could cause a loss of business.\nWe cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. If one of our own manufacturing operations or one of our third-party manufacturers violates or is accused of violating local or international labor laws or other applicable regulations, or engages in labor or other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our products are sold as unethical, we could suffer negative publicity, which could tarnish our brands\u2019 image or result in a loss of sales. In addition, if such negative publicity affected one of our customers, it could result in a loss of business for us.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nWe have historically pursued strategic acquisitions as part of our long-term business strategy and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost and operational synergies. Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations, including expected levels of revenues, and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures. In addition, following completion of an acquisition, we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately. Acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence, and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such other businesses, even if obtained, may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities. Annual cost savings in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated. We cannot assure you that we will realize the full expected benefits of any acquisition within the anticipated time frame or at all.\nIn addition, the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and time-consuming, diverting management attention from core operations, and may not be entirely successful. The process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses\nand the possible loss of key personnel. Integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to successfully integrate any newly acquired business, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe had approximately 63,000 employees worldwide as of December 28, 2019, and our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our employees or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations.\nWe had approximately 63,000 employees worldwide as of December 28, 2019. This means we have a significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Approximately 55,000 of those employees were outside of the United States. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend resources responding to such increases and lower our margins.\nIn addition, less than 20 of our employees in the United States and a significant number of our international employees are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If there were a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we would become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter, or periods of unseasonably cool and wet weather in the spring or summer, can negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. In addition, severe weather events such as snow storms or hurricanes typically lead to temporarily reduced retail traffic. Any of these conditions could result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise and reduced replenishment shipments to our wholesale customers.\nWe are subject to certain risks as a result of our indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness primarily includes (i) a $1.0 billion revolving loan facility (the \u201cRevolving Loan Facility\u201d), a $750 million term loan a facility (the \u201cTerm Loan A\u201d), a $500 million term loan b facility (the \u201cTerm Loan B\u201d) and an A$65 million Australian revolving loan facility (the \u201cAustralian Revolver\u201d and together with the Revolving Loan Facility, the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), (ii) our $900 million 4.625% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201c4.625% Senior Notes\u201d) and our $900 million 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c4.875% Senior Notes\u201d), (iii) our \u20ac500 million 3.5% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201c3.5% Senior Notes\u201d and together with the 4.625% Senior Notes and the 4.875% Senior Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), and (iv) and up to $300 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the \u201cAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility\u201d) and (v) a \u20ac100 million European revolving loan facility (the \u201cEuropean Revolving Loan Facility\u201d).\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility contains restrictions that affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to borrow funds, pay dividends or make other distributions, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, or create liens on our assets. Covenants in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization), or leverage ratio. The indentures governing the Senior Notes also restrict our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness in an amount that exceeds the greater of (a) $3.0 billion or (b) the amount that would cause our consolidated secured net debt ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00, as well as certain other customary covenants and restrictions. These restrictions and covenants could limit our ability to obtain additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments, fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates, obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default that accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness and increases the interest rate on the outstanding principal amount under such facilities, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.\nThe lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for certain foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. Additionally, these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our U.S. subsidiaries and certain other foreign subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. The financial institutions that are party to the\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility have a lien on certain of our domestic accounts receivable. As a result of these pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders under that facility will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and, at their option, liquidate these assets, and if we fail to meet our repayment or other obligations under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, the secured parties under that facility will be entitled to take control of our accounts receivable pledged to them and all collections on those receivables, and direct our obligors to make payment on such receivables directly to the secured parties, which in each case would adversely impact the operations of our business.\nOur Revolving Loan Facility, Term Loan A, Term Loan B and European Revolving Loan Facility bear interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the contemplated transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark reference for short-term interests may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt.\nMarket returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension, which may require significant funding.\nThe plan assets of our pension plans, which had a return of approximately 15% during 2019 and a loss of approximately 5% during 2018, are invested mainly in domestic and international equities, bonds, hedge funds and real estate. We are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia. The funded status of these plans, and the related cost reflected in our consolidated financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPension Protection Act\u201d), losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. Under the Pension Protection Act funding rules, our U.S. qualified pension plan is approximately 91% funded as of December 28, 2019. Any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations.\nInability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Loan Facility and other external debt financings to meet the cash requirements of our business. We have significant capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the cash flow needs of our business and pursue strategic acquisitions.\nAlthough we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt at a reasonable cost when necessary. The ability to have continued access to reasonably priced credit is dependent upon our current and future capital structure, financial performance, our credit ratings and general economic conditions. If we are unable to access the capital markets at a reasonable economic cost, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws, as well as Maryland law, may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal that you might consider favorable.\nOur charter permits our Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire Board and without stockholder approval, to amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have the authority to issue. In addition, our Board of Directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and other terms and conditions of the classified or reclassified shares. Our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our charter also provides that a director may be removed at any time, but only for cause, as defined in our charter, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. We have also elected to be subject to certain provisions of Maryland law that provide that any and all vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our remaining directors in office, even if they do not constitute a quorum, and that any director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred. Under Maryland law, our Board of Directors also is permitted, without stockholder approval, to implement a classified board structure at any time.\nOur bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by or at the direction of our Board of\nDirectors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice by the stockholder in accordance with the advance notice procedures of our bylaws and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of our bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business combinations between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder, including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder includes any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the then-outstanding voting power of our stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the then-outstanding voting power of our stock. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if our Board of Directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, our Board of Directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by our Board. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between us and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by our Board of Directors and approved by two supermajority votes or our common stockholders must receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares. The statute permits various other exemptions from its provisions.\nThese and other provisions of Maryland law or our charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be considered favorably by our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 91416, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "HBI"}
