{"cik": "3545", "company": "ALICO, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of the known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities. Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Business\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nFresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from Hurricane Irma. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.\nCitrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop.\nCitrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.\nBoth of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm\nmakes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.\nOur revenues from our citrus business were approximately 97.4%, 96.1% and 95.1% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.\nMany companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.\nImportant factors with respect to our competitors include the following:\n\u2022\nSome of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them\n\u2022\nto respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry.\n\u2022\nWe cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.\n\u2022\nOur competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.\nWe depend on our relationship with Tropicana for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in this relationship could harm our sales. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows.\nThe Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 88.6%, 86.6% and 85.6% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.\nAgricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. While according to Nielsen data consumer demand for orange juice has decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so if demand continues to decline. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.\nThere is no assurance that Alico 2.0 will continue to provide the cost savings that we have achieved.\nOn November 16, 2017, we announced Alico 2.0, which we expect will result in a significant citrus grove cost savings and a decline in Alico Citrus\u2019 general and administrative expenses. While the Company has executed on its Alico 2.0 initiatives and achieved significant grove cost savings, there is no assurance that we can maintain these cost levels.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There is no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.\nThe sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance, however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.\nOur agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.\nOur operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are adequate for our agricultural needs.\nSurface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.\nWe engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement is currently attracting significant attention in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress, with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions\nthat could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who are found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks.\nWe seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, in fiscal year 2015 we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management\u2019s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014 we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and in January of 2018 we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.\nFrom time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.\nWe may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.\nWe continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.\nThese transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations\nor the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.\nOur citrus business is seasonal.\nOur citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.\nWe face significant competition in our agricultural operations.\nWe face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government\u2019s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.\nExcess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.\nFresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.\nIn addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nIncreases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.\nWe and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.\nIncreases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nWe are subject to transportation risks.\nWe depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land. Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.\nIn the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 we paid approximately $2,755,000, $3,089,000 and $3,106,000 in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (\u201cGreen Belt\u201d) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $91,312,000, $104,017,000 and $105,496,000 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $514,330,000, $537,183,000 and $539,790,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of \"Green Belt\" values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.\nLiability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.\nOur agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site\u2019s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.\nInflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nInflation can have a major impact on our citrus operations. The citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nComputer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nAs of September 30, 2019, we had approximately $163,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and line of credit and an additional $94,500,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified\ntypes of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nTo service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others:\n\u2022\neconomic and competitive conditions\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations\n\u2022\noperating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and\n\u2022\ndelays in implementing any strategic projects\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nSome of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.\nOur credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock has low trading volume and the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company\u2019s public float and such increase may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for a stockholder to sell their common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock.\nOn November 12, 2019, 734 Investors effected a distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members. The distribution of Alico shares of common stock by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company\u2019s public float and such increase may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain future funding, if needed, as well as create a potential market overhang.\nWe may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.\nWe have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the\nfuture, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors\u2019 current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nIn fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock in two separate authorizations. In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continued through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continued through May 24, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.\nIf we were to conduct a tender offer or engage in a share repurchase program, holders of our securities would be subject to certain risks associated with a decrease in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock.\nIn September 2018 the Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer. During the Tender Offer the Company repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. While we have no plans to conduct another tender offer at this time, we may conduct another tender offer or engage in the repurchase of our shares in the future. Shareholders could be adversely affected by a reduction in our \u201cpublic float,\u201d that is, the number of shares owned by outside shareholders and available for trading in the securities markets, if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market repurchases of its shares. Although the Company is not currently pursuing a tender offer, there are no assurances that our Board of Directors will not authorize the Company to do so in the future. Engaging in a tender offer or repurchase program in the future could have a negative effect on our share price.", "PERMNO": 11790, "SIC": 100, "TIC": "ALCO"}
