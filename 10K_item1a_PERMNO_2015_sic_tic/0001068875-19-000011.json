{"cik": "1068875", "company": "BLUCORA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and future results may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties that should be considered carefully. In addition, this report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below. The occurrence of one or more of the events listed below could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, reputation, financial condition, cash flows or ability to continue current operations without any direct or indirect impairment or disruption, which is referred to throughout these Risk Factors as a \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect.\u201d\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESSES\nThe Tax Preparation and Wealth Management markets are very competitive, and failure to effectively compete could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Tax Preparation business operates in a very competitive marketplace. There are many competing software products and digital services. Intuit\u2019s TurboTax and H&R Block\u2019s products and services have a significant percentage of the software and digital service market. Our Tax Preparation business must also compete with alternate methods of tax preparation, such as storefront tax preparation services, which includes both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty Tax, Jackson Hewitt and Credit Karma, and it may also be subject to new market entrants who may take some of our market share. As digital-do-it-yourself tax preparation continues to be characterized by intense competition, including heavy marketing expenditures, price-based competition, and new entrants, maintaining and growing market share becomes more challenging unless brand relevance, customer experience, and feature/functionality provide meaningful incremental value. If we cannot continue to offer software and services that have quality and ease-of-use that are compelling to consumers, market the software and services in a cost-effective manner, offer ancillary services that are attractive to users, and develop the software and services at a low enough cost to be able to offer them at a competitive price point, it could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Tax Preparation business also faces potential competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers, which could reduce the need for TaxAct\u2019s software and services. These or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may cause us to lose customers and revenue. The Free File Program is currently the sole means by which the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) offers tax software to taxpayers. The Free File Program is a partnership between the IRS and the Free File Alliance, a group of private sector tax preparation companies of which we are a member that has agreed to offer free electronic tax filing services to taxpayers meeting certain income-based guidelines. As part of the program, the IRS has agreed that it will not compete with Free File Alliance companies in providing free, digital tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers. The Free File Program\u2019s continuation depends on a number of factors, including increasing public awareness of and access to the free program, as well as continued government support. The IRS\u2019s current agreement with the Free File Alliance is scheduled to expire in October 2021. If the Free File Program is not renewed upon expiration of the agreement or if the Free File Program is terminated, and the IRS enters the software development and return preparation space, the federal government would be a publicly funded direct competitor of us and the U.S. tax services industry as a whole.\nThe wealth management industry in which our Wealth Management business operates is also highly competitive, and we may not be able to maintain our customers, financial advisors, distribution network, or the terms on which we provide our products and services. Our Wealth Management business competes based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, technology, product offerings and features, price, and perceived financial strength. Competitors in the wealth management industry include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers, and other financial institutions. Many of these competitors have greater market share, offer a broader range of\nproducts, and have greater financial resources. In addition, over time, certain sectors of the wealth management industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This consolidation could result in our competitors gaining greater resources, and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. In addition, our Wealth Management business seeks to differentiate itself on the basis of offering tax-smart investing advice and solutions. There is no guarantee that this differentiation will be meaningful to our customers and potential customers, or that another competitor will not adopt a similar strategy more effectively. In either case, our ability to compete effectively in the market could be damaged.\nPoor service or performance of the financial products we offer or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products may cause our Wealth Management business customers to withdraw assets on short notice.\nCustomer service and investment performance are important factors in the success of our Wealth Management business. Strong customer service and investment performance help increase customer retention and generate sales of products and services. In contrast, poor service or investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. Customers can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will. There can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to that of our competitors, and historical performance is not indicative of future returns. A decline or perceived decline in investment performance, on an absolute or relative basis, could cause a decline in sales of mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of asset management relationships. Such actions may reduce our aggregate amount of advisory assets and reduce management fees. Poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through independent financial advisors.\nIn addition, the emergence of new financial products or services from others, or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products, may result in the loss of accounts in our Wealth Management business. We must also monitor the pricing of our services and financial products in relation to competitors and periodically may need to adjust commission and fee rates, interest rates on deposits and margin loans, and other fee structures to remain competitive. Competition from other financial services firms, such as reduced commissions to attract customers or trading volume, direct-to-investor online financial services, or higher deposit interest rates to attract customer cash balances, could adversely impact our business. Customers of our Wealth Management business could also reduce the aggregate amount of their assets managed by us or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences, changes in our (or our financial advisors\u2019) reputation in the marketplace, changes in customer management or ownership, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. Our customers can withdraw the assets we manage on short notice, making our future customer and revenue base unpredictable. A reduction in advisory assets and the resulting decrease in revenues and earnings could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nChanges in domestic and international economic, political and other factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on our business.\nOur Wealth Management business operates in the United States and global financial markets, and our Tax Preparation business offers tax filing services in the federal jurisdiction of the United States, various state jurisdictions and Canada. Accordingly, we are affected by United States and global economic and political conditions that directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the domestic and global financial markets and economies, which may be detrimental to our operating results. In addition, because the significant majority of our revenue is earned within the United States, economic conditions in the United States have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence.\nDomestic and international factors that could affect our business include, but are not limited to, trading levels, investing, origination activity in the securities markets, security and underlying asset valuations, the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates, real estate values, the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers, the supply of and demand for loans and deposits, United States and foreign government fiscal and tax policies, United States and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities, inflation, decline and stress or recession in the United States and global economies generally, terrorism and armed conflicts, and natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies. Furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, certain life events, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality.\nWhile United States and global financial markets have, at a macro level, recently experienced growth, uncertainty and potential volatility remain. For instance, on December 6, 2018, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 800 points before recovering rapidly to close the day down 79 points. A period of sustained downturns and/or volatility in the securities markets,\nchanges in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, a return to increased credit market dislocations, reductions in the value of real estate, and other negative market factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on our business. We could experience a decline in commission revenue from lower trading volumes, a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our customers, a reduction in revenue from capital markets and advisory transactions due to reduced activity, increased credit provisions and charge-offs, losses sustained from our customers\u2019 and market participants\u2019 failure to fulfill their settlement obligations, reduced net interest earnings, and other losses. Periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses, including, but not limited to, our interest expense on debt, rent, facilities and salary expenses are fixed and, our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited.\nOther more specific trends may also affect our financial condition and results of operations, including, for example: changes in the mix of products preferred by investors that may cause increases or decreases in our fee revenues associated with such products, depending on whether investors gravitate towards or away from such products. The timing of such trends, if any, and their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations are beyond our control.\nChallenging economic times and changes to the Federal or various states' tax code (personal and/or corporate), such as the recent changes passed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results. Poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Any of these events could have a Material Adverse Effect. See \u201cWe may be negatively impacted by the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or by any future changes in tax laws\u201d for a discussion of additional risks related to changes in the tax code.\nEach of these factors could impact customer activity in all of our businesses and have a Material Adverse Effect. In addition, these factors may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and to grow our business.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain productive advisors, our financial results will be negatively impacted.\nOur Wealth Management business derives a large portion of its revenues from commissions and fees generated by its advisors. Our ability to attract and retain productive advisors has contributed significantly to our growth and success. If we fail to attract new advisors or to retain and motivate our current advisors, our business may suffer. In addition, the wealth management industry in general is experiencing a decline in the number of younger financial advisors entering the industry. We are not immune to that industry trend. If we are unable to replace advisors as they retire, or to assist retiring advisors with transitioning their practices to existing advisors, we could experience a decline in revenue and earnings.\nThe market for productive advisors is highly competitive, and we devote significant resources to attracting and retaining the most qualified advisors. In attracting and retaining advisors, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions such as wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other independent broker-dealers. Financial industry competitors are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts, upfront payments, and greater compensation to attract successful financial advisors. These can be important factors in a current advisor\u2019s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective advisor\u2019s decision to join us. If we are not successful in retaining highly qualified advisors, we may not be able to recover the expense involved in attracting and training these individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the advisors needed to achieve our growth objectives.\nMoreover, the costs associated with successfully attracting and retaining advisors could be significant, and there is no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenues from those advisors\u2019 business to offset those costs. Designing and implementing new or modified compensation arrangements and equity structures to successfully attract and retain advisors is complicated. Changes to these arrangements could themselves cause instability within our existing investment teams and negatively impact our financial results and ability to grow.\nIn addition, as some of HD Vest\u2019s advisors grow their advisory assets, they may decide to disassociate from HD Vest to establish their own registered investment advisers (\u201cRIAs\u201d) and take customers and associated assets into those businesses. HD Vest seeks to deter advisors from taking this route by continuously evaluating its technology, product offerings, and service, as well as its advisor compensation, fees, and pay-out policies, to ensure that HD Vest is competitive in the market and attractive to successful advisors. We may not be successful in dissuading such advisors from forming their own RIAs, which could cause a material volume of customer assets to leave HD Vest\u2019s platform, which would reduce our revenues and could cause a Material Adverse Effect.\nRapid growth may place significant demands on our resources.\nWe have experienced rapid growth since the completion of our Strategic Transformation. Our anticipated future growth will place a substantial demand on our managerial, operational and financial resources due to:\n\u2022\nthe need to manage relationships with various strategic partners and other third parties;\n\u2022\nthe need to maintain levels of service expected by clients and customers;\n\u2022\nthe pressure to deliver our products and services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in hiring and retaining skilled personnel necessary to support our business;\n\u2022\npressures for the continued development of our products and financial and information management systems; and\n\u2022\nthe possible need to create lines of businesses or departments that do not now exist, and to hire, train, motivate and manage a growing number of staff.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively achieve or manage any future growth. If we have not made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with this expansion or if our systems, procedures, or controls are not adequate to support our operations, our business could be harmed and we could experience a Material Adverse Effect.\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products and services.\nThe tax preparation and wealth management industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry and security standards, and frequent new product introductions. Our competitors in these industries offer new and enhanced products and services every year. Consequently, customer expectations are constantly changing. We must successfully innovate and develop or offer new products and features to meet evolving customer needs and demands, while continually updating our technology infrastructure. We must devote significant resources to developing our skills, tools, and capabilities in order to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies. Our inability to quickly and effectively innovate our products, services, and infrastructure could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nWe offer our digital tax preparation products and services through our website and through our mobile app. If our customers don\u2019t deem our website or our mobile app user friendly or if they deem our competitors\u2019 website or mobile app more user friendly or better than ours, our market share could decline, which could have a Material Adverse Effect. In addition, we regularly make upgrades to the technology we use for our tax preparation product that are expected to provide a better user experience and help us to keep existing customers or attract new customers. If our mobile app or the other upgrades we make to the technology we use in our Tax Preparation business are not successful, it could result in wasted development costs or damage to our brands and market share, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect. We may also encounter problems in connection with our mobile app, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of new user experiences.\nOur business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products and fees earned from management of advisory accounts.\nA large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities. Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues, business and financial condition. In addition, if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions, we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities. Should issuers of these products leave the market or discontinue offering or paying trail compensation on some or all of their products, our revenues could be negatively impacted. The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition, renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new, lower-priced investment products and services. Changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues, business and financial condition. Asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees, and investment advisers generally are experiencing advisory fee compression due to intense competition. Management fees are primarily based on advisory assets, which are impacted by net inflow/outflow of customer assets and market values. Below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new customers and thus further impact our business and financial condition. If we were to experience the loss of managed accounts, our fee revenue would decline. In addition, in periods of declining market values, our advisory assets may also decline, which would negatively impact our fee revenues and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nInvestors in the pooled vehicles that we advise can redeem their investments in those funds at any time without prior notice, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nInvestors in the mutual funds and some other pooled investment vehicles that we advise may redeem their investments in those funds at any time without prior notice, and investors in other types of pooled vehicles we advise may typically redeem their investments on fairly limited or no prior notice, thereby reducing our advisory assets. These investors may redeem their investments for any number of reasons, including general financial market conditions, the absolute or relative investment performance we have achieved, or their own financial condition and requirements. In a declining stock market, the pace of redemptions could accelerate. Poor investment performance relative to other funds tends to result in decreased purchases and increased redemptions of fund shares.\nWe have had recent senior leadership transitions, and if we are not effective in managing those transitions, our business could be adversely impacted and we could experience a Material Adverse Effect.\nWe have had recent senior leadership transition in connection with our Strategic Transition and otherwise and have replaced some of our executive officers and senior leadership team. While many of our executive officers have relevant industry experience, they are new to our Company. Changes in senior management are inherently disruptive and can be difficult to manage, and efforts to implement any new strategic or operating goals may not succeed in the absence of a long-term management team. Periods of transition in senior management are often difficult due to cultural differences that may result from changes in strategy and style and the time required for new executives to gain detailed operational knowledge. These changes could also cause concerns to third parties with whom we do business, and may increase the likelihood of turnover of our employees and, in the case of our Wealth Management business, turnover of advisors. If we are not effective in managing these leadership and employee transitions, our business could be adversely impacted and we could experience a Material Adverse Effect.\nGovernment regulation of our business, including increased regulation or the interpretation of existing laws, rules or regulations, could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations that affect our business, such as financial services, data privacy and security requirements, tax, digital content, employment, consumer protection and fraud protection, among others. In addition, there have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of the laws and regulations that affect both our Wealth Management and our Tax Preparation businesses. As we expand our products and services and revise our business models, we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny. Regulators may adopt new laws or regulations, or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from our interpretation or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. If we are found to not be in compliance with certain laws, rules or regulations, it could have a Material Adverse Effect. Increased or new regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, rules or regulations could, among other things, result in penalties or fines, impose significant limitations on the way we conduct our business, require changes to our business, require certain notifications to customers or employees, restrict our use of personal information, cause our customers to cease utilizing our products or services, make our business more costly, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, require us to modify our current or future products or services in a manner that is detrimental to our business and result in additional compliance costs, which could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our Tax Preparation business or offer our tax preparation products and services. We may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, rules or regulations, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, fines and other liabilities that did not previously apply. We are also required to comply with Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) requirements and a variety of state revenue agency standards. Requirements imposed by the FTC or state agencies, including new requirements or their interpretation of existing laws, rules or regulations, could be burdensome on our business, cause us to lose market share due to product changes we are required to implement or may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner and at an acceptable price, all of which could have a Material Adverse Effect. In addition, in our Tax Preparation business, we generate revenue from certain financial products related to our tax preparation software and services. These products include prepaid debit cards or gift cards on which a tax filer may receive his or her tax refund and the ability of certain of our users to have the fees for our services deducted from their tax refund. Any regulation of these products by state or federal governments, or any competing products offered by state and federal tax collection agencies, could materially and adversely impact our revenue from these financial products.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws, regulations, and industry rules relating to the collection, use, and security of user data. We expect regulation in this area to increase, and our current data protection policies and practices may not be sufficient and thus may require modification. Numerous jurisdictions have passed, and may in the future pass, new laws related to the use and retention of consumer information, and this area continues to be an area of interest for U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with all of those interpretations and applications. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations that protect user data could harm our reputation and could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and interpretations of such laws, rules and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit, and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, audit, and risk management personnel. While we have adopted systems, policies, and procedures reasonably designed to comply or facilitate compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and interpretations of such laws, rules and regulations, these systems, policies, and procedures may not be fully effective. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to investigations, claims, or other actions or proceedings by regulators or third parties with respect to our past or future compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, the outcome of which may have a Material Adverse Effect.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidance, such failure could have a Material Adverse Effect. See \u201cOur Wealth Management business is subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations could have a Material Adverse Effect\u201d for additional information regarding the regulation of our business.\nOur Wealth Management business is subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Wealth Management business is heavily regulated by multiple agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these regulators\u2019 laws, rules, and regulations could result in the restriction of the ongoing conduct or growth, or even liquidation of, parts of our business and otherwise cause a Material Adverse Effect. The regulatory environment in which our Wealth Management business operates is continually evolving, and the level of financial regulation to which we are subject has generally increased in recent years. Among the most significant regulatory changes affecting our Wealth Management business is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which mandates broad changes in the supervision and regulations of the wealth management industry. Regulators implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have adopted, proposed to adopt, and may in the future adopt regulations that could impact the manner in which we will market HD Vest products and services, manage HD Vest operations, and interact with regulators. In addition, the Trump Administration has initiated and in some cases completed a broad review of U.S. fiscal laws and regulations. If significant changes are enacted as a result of this review, they could negatively impact our Wealth Management business and cause a Material Adverse Effect.\nOn April 18, 2018, the SEC issued draft rulemaking addressing standards of conduct for broker-dealers and disclosure requirements for broker-dealers and investment advisers. As presently drafted, the SEC\u2019s proposed rules would impose a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard on broker-dealers and their registered representatives, as well as a new disclosure form (Form CRS) that both broker-dealers and investment advisers would have to give clients before providing them investment advice. The SEC\u2019s proposed rules, if adopted in their current form, would heighten the standard of care for broker-dealers when making investment recommendations and would impose disclosure and policy and procedural obligations that could impact the compensation HD Vest and its representatives receive for selling certain types of products, particularly those (such as mutual funds) that offer different compensation across different share classes. The SEC\u2019s proposed rules would also limit our ability to use the terms \u201cadvisor\u201d or \u201cadviser\u201d when referring publicly to our registered representatives who are not also advisory licensed. Based on comments by SEC Commissioners when the proposed rules were first presented, however, we believe that the SEC\u2019s proposed rules may substantially change during the public comment process. In addition, the SEC\u2019s final rules may not be issued for many months and, even then, could be the subject of litigation. Accordingly, we cannot predict if and when the SEC will complete any final rulemaking or what the contours of the final rules will be. However, the SEC\u2019s final rules could result in additional compliance costs, lesser compensation, and management distraction, all of which could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nLegislatures and securities regulators in certain states in which we do business have enacted (or have considered enacting) their own standard of conduct rules for broker-dealers, insurance agents and investment advisers. To date, the States of Nevada, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York have passed legislation or proposed regulations of this sort. The requirements and scope of these state rules are not uniform. Accordingly, we may have to adopt different policies and procedures in different states, which could create added compliance, supervision and sales costs for our Wealth Management\nbusiness. Should more states enact similar legislation or regulation, it could result in material additional compliance costs and could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Wealth Management business distributes its products and services through financial advisors who affiliate with us as independent contractors. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change, or at least challenge, the classification of our financial advisors as independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified our advisors as independent contractors, the IRS or other U.S. federal or state authorities or similar authorities may determine that we have misclassified our advisors as independent contractors for employment tax or other purposes and, as a result, seek additional taxes from us or attempt to impose fines and penalties, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the SEC and FINRA have extensive rules and regulations with respect to capital requirements. As a registered broker-dealer, our Wealth Management business is subject to Rule 15c3-1 (the \u201cNet Capital Rule\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related requirements of self-regulatory organizations, which specify minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. As a result of the Net Capital Rule, our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries that comprise our Wealth Management business could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt, redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock, or pay dividends, which could have a Material Adverse Effect. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business.\nOur Wealth Management business offers products sponsored by third parties, including, but not limited to, mutual funds, insurance, annuities and alternative investments. These products are subject to complex regulations that change frequently. Although we have controls in place to facilitate compliance with such regulations, there can be no assurance that our interpretation of the regulations will be consistent with various regulators\u2019 interpretations, that our procedures will be viewed as adequate by regulatory examiners, or that the operating subsidiaries will be deemed to be in compliance with regulatory requirements in all material respects. If products sold by our Wealth Management business do not perform as anticipated due to market factors or otherwise, or if product sponsors become insolvent or are otherwise unable to meet their obligations, this could result in material litigation and regulatory action against us. In addition, we could face liabilities for actual or alleged breaches of legal duties to customers with respect to the suitability of the financial products we make available in our open architecture product platform or the investment advice of our financial advisors.\nSee \u201cGovernment regulation of our business, including increased regulation or the interpretation of existing laws, rules or regulations, could have a Material Adverse Effect\u201d for additional information regarding the regulation of our business.\nThe transition of our Wealth Management business to a new clearing platform may negatively impact our operations and our advisors and the customers of our Wealth Management business.\nDuring the second half of 2018, our Wealth Management business completed the conversion (the \u201cConversion\u201d) of our clearing business to Fidelity Clearing & Custody Solutions (\u201cFCCS\u201d). The Conversion involved significant operational, technological, and logistical effort, since it required all of our Wealth Management business and customer accounts to migrate to FCCS\u2019s clearing platform, together with all of the underlying customer data. While the conversion of client assets is complete, we continue to acclimate our advisors and customers to FCCS\u2019s technology, product offerings, processes and procedures, which we expect will continue through the first half of 2019.\nThe movement of business to a new clearing firm is an extremely complex and intensive undertaking, and we have committed a significant amount of human, technological, and financial resources to ensure a successful transition. Given the complexity and magnitude of the transition effort, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience unexpected costs, technological failures, incompatibility of systems or policies, or loss of employees, advisors and customers, which could have a Material Adverse Effect. In addition, during the Conversion, we experienced delays in responding to service requests from our advisors. A recurrence of those delays could result in our advisors becoming unsatisfied and leaving.\nWe may not realize the financial, operational, and customer-experience benefits that we project over the life of our clearing contract with FCCS. Our cash sweep program under the new clearing firm is a significant component of the anticipated financial benefits of the Conversion. The cash sweep program is subject to interest rate volatility. Should the Federal Reserve not increase interest rates at the pace or to the levels anticipated, we would likely recognize lower revenue from the cash sweep program than expected, potentially in a material amount. In addition, our customers may choose to reduce the amount of cash in their accounts, which would reduce the amount of cash in our sweep program. This would reduce our revenue from the cash sweep program, potentially in a material amount. In addition, as part of the Conversion, we plan to implement policies and pricing intended to encourage the conversion of direct-to-fund assets onto FCCS\u2019s clearing platform, but we may not realize the level of conversion of such assets onto FCCS\u2019s clearing platform that we anticipate. Should the\nnumber of direct-to-fund assets that convert to FCCS\u2019s platform over the life of our agreement with FCCS fall short of expectations, we will likely receive less economic benefit from the new clearing arrangement than we expected, which could be material.\nThe technology, service and product offerings presented by FCCS may not be accepted by our advisors or customers at the levels we anticipate, and may not provide the level of benefits that we expect even if accepted. If a significant number of our advisors or customers are or become dissatisfied by the different technology, systems, processes, policies and products that FCCS offers and they leave it could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nIn addition, our Wealth Management business is dependent on the performance, liquidity and continuity of its clearing firm. Should FCCS fail to provide clearing services at the contracted levels for any reason or suffer a liquidity event, or if FCCS significantly changes the products and services it offers, it could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nSimultaneously with the conversion to FCCS, we initiated transition to a new investment advisory platform offered by Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. (\u201cEnvestnet\u201d). The Envestnet platform is comprehensive and its implementation will substantially change how our Wealth Management business and its Advisors conduct advisory business. Like the clearing firm conversion, implementation of the Envestnet platform was complex and entailed significant effort and commitment from our employees and contractors. While implementation of the Envestnet platform is complete, we continue to enhance the platform to conform to our expectations and to acclimate our staff and advisors to the new platform\u2019s workflows, capabilities and procedures. If we are unable to fully integrate the Envestnet platform with our other systems, this could have a Material Adverse Effect. Similarly, if a significant number of our advisors are or become dissatisfied by the transition to the new Envestnet platform, or by the different technology, systems, processes, and policies it offers, they could leave our Wealth Management business, which could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur operating systems and network infrastructure are subject to significant and constantly evolving cybersecurity and other technological risks, and the security measures that we have implemented to secure confidential and personal information may be breached; a potential breach may pose risks to the uninterrupted operation of our systems, expose us to mitigation costs, litigation, investigation, fines and penalties by authorities, claims by persons whose information was disclosed, and damage to our reputation.\nWe collect and retain certain sensitive personal data. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses collect, use, and retain large amounts of confidential personal and financial information from their customers, including information regarding income, assets, family members, credit cards, tax returns, login credentials and passwords, bank accounts, social security numbers, and healthcare. Maintaining the integrity of our systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of our customers and advisors, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our customers' personal information. A major breach of our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners may have materially negative consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. We may detect, or we may receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our servers or our software. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited.\nIn addition, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that can be used to attack our offerings. Although we utilize network and application security measures, internal controls, and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. Any such incident could cause a Material Adverse Effect and require us to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations. In addition, our employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) and contractors may have access to sensitive and personal information of our customers and employees. While we conduct background checks on our employees and contractors and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in a security breach.\nIt is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data. Unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software. Further, our customers may choose to use the same user ID and password across multiple products and services unrelated to our products. Such customers\u2019 login credentials may be stolen from products offered by third-party service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products, which could result in disclosure of confidential information.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data through cloud services. While we conduct due diligence on these third-party partners with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures, and, in any event, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these security and business controls, resulting in a loss of sensitive and personal customer or employee information and data.\nWhile we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance is subject to exclusions and may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks as well as the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of appropriate security measures. We could also suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins, inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our businesses.\nConcerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment, generally, could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation.\nThe continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments, businesses and consumers in general, indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common. If the global cybersecurity environment worsens, and there are increased instances of security breaches of third-party offerings where consumers\u2019 data and sensitive information is compromised, consumers may be less willing to use online offerings, particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data. In addition, the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of third-party offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity. Even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents, they could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether.\nIn addition, we currently plan to increase our capture and use of user data for marketing purposes. In connection with our use of user data for marketing efforts, concerns may be expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users, customers and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage the reputation of our business and our brands and adversely affect our operating results.\nStolen identity refund fraud could impede our Tax Preparation customers\u2019 ability to timely and successfully file their tax returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish customers\u2019 perceptions of the security and reliability of our tax preparation products and services, resulting in negative publicity. Increased governmental regulation to attempt to combat that fraud could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nCriminals may utilize stolen information obtained through hacking, phishing, and other means of identity theft in order to electronically file fraudulent federal and state tax returns. As a result, impacted taxpayers must complete additional forms and go through additional steps in order to report to appropriate authorities that their identities have been stolen and their tax returns were filed fraudulently. Though we offer assistance in the refund recovery process, stolen identity refund fraud could impede our customers\u2019 ability to timely and successfully file their returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish customers\u2019 perceptions of the security and reliability of our tax preparation products and services, resulting in negative publicity, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. In addition, if stolen identity refund fraud is perpetrated at a material level through our tax preparation products or services, state, federal, or foreign tax authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to process our customers\u2019 tax returns electronically. As a result, stolen identity fraud could have a Material Adverse Effect on our Tax Preparation business.\nFederal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have taken action, and may take action in the future, in an attempt to combat stolen identity refund fraud, which may require changes to our systems and business practices in ways we cannot anticipate. These actions may have a Material Adverse Effect on our Tax Preparation business.\nComplex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. This includes, for example, the European Union\u2019s new regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, and the new California Consumer Protection Act, which will become effective on January 1, 2020. If we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations, we might experience reduced demand for our offerings. Further, penalties for non-compliance with these laws may be significant.\nOther governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, require notification to customers or workers of a security breach, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results. Additionally, any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage, and maintain critical third-party business relationships for our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses, it could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses are dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and leverage new and existing relationships. We rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, contractors, financial institutions, and licensing partners, among others, in many areas of these businesses to deliver our services and products. In certain instances, the products or services provided through these third-party relationships may be difficult to replace or substitute, depending on the level of integration of the third party\u2019s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party\u2019s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third-party providers or vendors in the market. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high-quality products, services, and technologies or to update their products, services, and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations, which may materially reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers, and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nOur Wealth Management business does not offer any proprietary financial products. Instead, it distributes investment and insurance products through distribution agreements with third-party financial institutions, including banks, mutual funds, and insurance companies. These products are sold by our advisors, who are independent contractors. Maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors and advisors is an important part of our growth strategy because strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and increase our advisory assets, revenues, and profitability. There can be no assurance that the distribution and advisor relationships we have established will continue, or that they will continue under existing terms. Our distribution partners and advisors may cease to operate, consolidate, institute cost-cutting efforts, discontinue product sales or compensation streams, or otherwise terminate their relationship with us. Any such reduction in access to third-party distributors and advisors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our Wealth Management segment. In addition, there are risks associated with our third-party clearing firm that we rely on to provide clearing services for our Wealth Management business that are discussed above.\nAccess to investment and insurance product distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the broker-dealer, investment advisory and insurance industries. Relationships with distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of revenue we realize based on sales of particular products or customer assets. In addition, regulatory changes (such as the SEC\u2019s proposed \u201cbest interest\u201d standard) may negatively impact our revenues and profits related to particular products or services. Any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale, or revenue associated with those products, could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business requires a precise development and release schedule and any delays or issues with accuracy or quality may damage our reputation and could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur tax preparation software and online service must be ready to launch in final form near the beginning of each calendar year to take advantage of the full tax season. We must update the code for our software and service on a precise schedule each year to account for annual changes in tax laws and regulations and ensure that the software and service are accurate. Delayed and unpredictable changes to federal and state tax laws and regulations can cause an already tight development cycle to become even more challenging. If we are unable to meet this precise schedule and we launch our software and service late, we risk losing customers to our competitors. If we cannot develop our software with a high degree of accuracy and quality, we risk errors in the tax returns that are generated. Such errors could result in loss of reputation, lower customer retention, or legal claims, fees, and payouts related to the warranty on our software and service, which could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe specialized and highly seasonal nature of our Tax Preparation business presents financial risks and operational challenges, which, if not satisfactorily addressed, could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Tax Preparation business is highly seasonal, with a significant portion of our annual revenue for such services earned in the first four months of our fiscal year. The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a number of challenges for us, including cash and resource management during the last eight months of our fiscal year, when our Tax Preparation business generally operates at a loss and incurs fixed costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season, responding to changes in competitive conditions, including marketing, pricing, and new product offerings, which could affect our position during the tax season, and ensuring optimal uninterrupted operations and service delivery during the tax season. If we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we are unable to satisfactorily address the challenges described above and related challenges associated with a seasonal business, it could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nIf our Tax Preparation business fails to process transactions effectively or fails to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, it could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur Tax Preparation business processes a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, particularly during tax season. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that fraudulent activity may affect our services. In addition to any direct damages and fines that may result from any such problems, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence in our controls may materially harm our business and damage our brand. The systems supporting our Tax Preparation business are comprised of multiple technology platforms, some of which are difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable, and timely manner, which could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe United States government\u2019s inability to agree on a federal budget may adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nIn the past, the failure of the United States government to timely complete its budget process has resulted in shutdowns of the federal government, including most recently a shutdown that began on December 22, 2018 and lasted until January 25, 2019. During these shutdowns, certain regulatory agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of the Treasury, have had to furlough critical employees and cease certain critical activities.\nDuring a prolonged government shutdown, the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to timely review and process tax return filings may be significantly delayed, and representatives of the Internal Revenue Service may be unable to answer crucial taxpayer questions. Even after the shutdown has ended, the Internal Revenue Service may be significantly delayed in processing tax return filings as a result of accumulating a backlog of filings during the shutdown. These may be further exacerbated in years where there are significant changes to existing tax legislation, such as the application of the Tax Legislation to tax return filings related to the 2018 tax year. Any uncertainty surrounding the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to process tax return filings and respond to taxpayer questions could cause our customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results, which could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur website and transaction management software, data center systems, or the systems of third-party co-location facilities and cloud service providers could fail or become unavailable or otherwise be inadequate, which could materially harm our reputation and/or result in a material loss of revenues and current or potential customers and have a Material Adverse Effect.\nAny system interruptions that result in the unavailability or unreliability of our websites, transaction processing systems, or network infrastructure could materially reduce our revenue and impair our ability to properly process transactions. We use both internally developed and third-party systems, including cloud computing and storage systems, for our online\nservices and certain aspects of transaction processing. Some of our systems are relatively new, and we have some systems that may need updating, which could cause them to be subject to failure or unreliability. Any system unavailability or unreliability may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in customer satisfaction, additional expense, or delays in reporting accurate financial information. For example, we have been migrating data to the cloud. This migration has been costly and has diverted some of management\u2019s attention and resources in order to ensure a smooth transition to the cloud.\nOur data centers and cloud service could be susceptible to damage or disruption, which could have a Material Adverse Effect. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses have business continuity plans that include secondary disaster recovery centers, but if their primary data centers fail and those disaster recovery centers do not fully restore the failed environments, our business could suffer. In particular, if such interruption occurs during the tax season, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on our Tax Preparation business.\nWe regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. Such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly and time consuming. In addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. Unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue or damage to our reputation.\nOur systems and operations, and those of our third-party service providers and partners, could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, earthquakes, other natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, internet breakdown, break-in, human error, software bugs, hardware failures, malicious attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, or other events beyond our control. Such damage or interruption may affect internal and external systems that we rely upon to provide our services, take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, and host other products and services. During the period in which services are unavailable, we could be unable or severely limited in our ability to generate revenues, and we may also be exposed to liability from those third parties to whom we provide services. We could face significant losses as a result of these events, and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all potential losses, which could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings or adverse court interpretations of the laws under which the Company operates could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability. We are currently subject to lawsuits and are likely to be subject to litigation in the future. In highly volatile markets, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased. Any lawsuits to which we are subject, such as purported class actions, shareholder derivative lawsuits or claims by wealth management customers, could result in substantial expenditures, generate adverse publicity and could significantly impair our business, or force us to cease offering certain products or services. Defense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of our management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. In addition, litigation or regulatory proceedings or actions brought by state or federal agencies relating to our products or services may result in additional restrictions on the offering of certain of our products or services. To the extent that any such additional restrictions or legal claims limit our ability to offer such products or services, it could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees, including our key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our businesses.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, and motivate highly skilled management, technical, sales and marketing, and corporate development personnel, including personnel with experience and expertise in the wealth management, tax preparation, and technology industries to support our new strategic focus. Qualified personnel with experience relevant to our businesses are scarce, and competition to recruit them is intense. If we fail to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified employees, we may have difficulties in supporting or expanding our businesses. Realignments of resources, reductions in workforce, or other operational decisions have created and could continue to create an unstable work environment and may have a negative effect on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate employees.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees. Changes of management or key employees may disrupt operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results or delay achievement of our business objectives. In addition, if we lose the services of one or more key employees and are unable to recruit and retain a suitable successor with relevant experience, we may not be able to successfully and timely manage our business or achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that any retention program we initiate will be successful at retaining employees, including key employees.\nWe use stock options, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards to recruit and retain senior-level employees. With respect to those employees to whom we issue such equity-based awards, we face a significant challenge in retaining them if the value of equity-based awards in the aggregate or individually is either not deemed by the employee to be substantial enough or deemed so substantial that the employee leaves after their equity-based awards vest. If our stock price does not increase significantly above the exercise prices of our options, we may need to issue new equity-based awards in order to motivate and retain our key employees. We may undertake or seek stockholder approval to undertake other equity-based programs to retain our employees, which may be viewed as dilutive to our existing stockholders or may increase our compensation costs. There can be no assurance that any such programs, if approved by our stockholders, or any other incentive programs, would be successful in motivating and retaining our employees.\nWe may be negatively impacted by the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or by any future changes in tax laws.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law. It is difficult to know at this time how our customers will view the new federal tax laws that were enacted in late 2017 because 2019 will be the first tax season where these laws are in effect. Possible outcomes include a short-term or long-term increase in customers that prefer professional tax advice and preparation services rather than using our software or we may see a change in our how customers value our software services as customers may perceive their tax preparation has become simpler as a result of the new tax laws, which could result in lower demand for our products and could reduce revenue and/or the number of units sold.\nChanges in state and federal tax laws require updates to our tax preparation software used in our Tax Preparation business. Such updates are costly and may be time consuming to ensure that they accurately reflect the new laws that are adopted. In addition, further changes in the way that state and federal governments structure their taxation regimes could also cause a Material Adverse Effect on our Tax Preparation business. The introduction of a simplified or flattened federal or state taxation structure may make our services less necessary or attractive to individual filers, which could reduce revenue and the number of units sold. We also face risk from the possibility of increased complexity in taxation structures, which may encourage some of our customers to seek professional tax advice instead of using our software or services. In the event that such changes to tax structures cause us to lose market share or cause a decline in customers, it could cause a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may be ineffective or leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nWe are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees and financial advisors, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies, recommending transactions that are not suitable, and improperly using or disclosing confidential information. Although we have internal controls and other risk-mitigating factors in place, this type of conduct is difficult to detect and deter, and could materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are further subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services that are used in our businesses. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as the risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency.\nIn our Wealth Management business, prevention and detection of wrongdoing or fraud by our advisors, who are not our employees and tend to be located remotely from our headquarters, present unique challenges. There cannot be any assurance that misconduct by our advisors will not lead to a Material Adverse Effect on our business.\nRIAs have fiduciary obligations that require us and our advisors to act in the best interests of our customers and to disclose any material conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest are under growing scrutiny by U.S. federal and state regulators. Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex. A perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation, the willingness of customers to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands, which could be negatively impacted by poor performance.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to regulatory proceedings or other events or activities attributed to our businesses, our employees, our vendors, or our partners may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of\nbrand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results. Such damage also would require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands.\nIf others claim that our services infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to seek expensive licenses, reengineer our services, engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation, or stop marketing and licensing our services.\nCompanies and individuals with rights relating to the technology industry have frequently resorted to litigation regarding intellectual property rights. These parties have in the past made, and may in the future make, claims against us alleging infringement of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy or publicity rights. Responding to any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention, cause product or service release delays, or require removal or redesigning of our products or services, payment of damages for infringement, or entry into royalty or licensing agreements. Our technology, services, and products may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. In some cases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear. In addition, the ownership or scope of such rights may be altered by changes in the legal landscape, such as through developments in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, or regulatory board decisions. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or content or license the infringed or similar technology or content on a timely and cost-effective basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not regularly conduct patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products or services infringes patents held by third parties. Patent searches may not return every issued patent or patent application that may be deemed relevant to a particular product or service. It is therefore difficult to determine, with any level of certainty, whether a particular product or service may be construed as infringing a current or future U.S. or foreign patent.\nWe rely heavily on our technology and intellectual property, but we may be unable to adequately or cost-effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our business and financial results. We may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, which can be time consuming, expensive, and difficult to predict.\nTo protect our rights related to our services and technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We also rely on laws pertaining to trademarks and domain names to protect the value of our corporate brands and reputation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services or technology, obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise violate or infringe our intellectual property rights. In addition, it is possible that others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. Effectively policing the unauthorized use of our services and technology is time-consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or other proprietary assets. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, or if others independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property, our competitive position could be materially weakened.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses, and if we are unsuccessful in completing any such acquisitions on favorable terms or integrating any company acquired it could result in a Material Adverse Effect.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses. There can be no guarantee that any of the opportunities that we evaluate will result in the purchase by us of any business or asset being evaluated, or that, if acquired, we will be able to successfully integrate such acquisition.\nIf we are successful in our pursuit of any complementary acquisition opportunities, we intend to use available cash, debt and/or equity financing, and/or other capital or ownership structures designed to diversify our capital sources and attract a competitive cost of capital, all of which may change our leverage profile. There are a number of factors that impact our ability to succeed in acquiring the companies and assets we identify, including competition for these companies and assets, sometimes from larger or better-funded competitors. As a result, our success in completing acquisitions is not guaranteed. Our expectation is that, to the extent we are successful, any acquisitions will be additive to our businesses, taking into account potential benefits of operational synergies. However, these new business additions and acquisitions, if any, involve a number of risks and may not achieve our expectations, and, therefore, we could be materially and adversely affected by any such new business additions or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the short or long-term value of any business or technology that we develop or acquire will be equal to the value of the cash and other consideration that we pay or expenses we incur.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nWe incurred debt in connection with the repayment of our credit facility used for the acquisition of HD Vest and the redemption of our convertible senior notes and may incur future debt, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nIn May 2017, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders in order to (a) refinance the credit facilities previously entered into in 2015 to finance the HD Vest acquisition, (b) redeem our convertible notes that were outstanding at the time, and (c) provide a term loan and revolving line of credit for future working capital, capital expenditure and general business purposes (the \u201cBlucora senior secured credit facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had $265.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the term loan, and we had not borrowed any amounts under the revolving credit facility. The final maturity date of the term loan is May 22, 2024. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, we may borrow up to $50.0 million.\nThis borrowing may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our businesses, to competitive pressures, and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and complementary acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincreasing our interest payment obligations in the event that interest rates rise; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nThe Blucora senior secured credit facilities impose certain restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens, incur indebtedness and make investments. In addition, the Blucora senior secured credit facilities include covenants, the breach of which may cause the outstanding indebtedness to be declared immediately due and payable. This borrowing, and our ability to repay it, may also negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.\nIn addition, we or our subsidiaries, may incur additional debt in the future. Any additional debt may result in risks similar to those discussed above or in other risks specific to the credit agreements entered into for those debts.\nExisting cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures.\nAlthough we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, the underlying levels of revenues and expenses that we project may not prove to be accurate. As of December 31, 2018, we had $265.0 million outstanding under our term loan. Servicing this debt will require the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our businesses may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition and results at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we may evaluate complementary acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies from time to time. Any such transactions, if completed, may use a significant portion of our cash balances and marketable investments. If we are unable to liquidate our investments when we need liquidity for complementary acquisitions or for other business purposes, we may need to change or postpone such acquisitions or find alternative financing for them. We may seek additional funding through public or private financings, through sales of equity, or through other arrangements. Our ability to raise funds may be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and increased uncertainty in the financial, capital, and credit markets. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Any sale of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable, or delayed in our ability, to develop or enhance our\nproducts or services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could materially harm our business.\nOTHER RISKS\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and such volatility may continue.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and such volatility does not always correspond to fluctuations in the market. Between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018, our closing stock price ranged from $14.45 to $40.25. On February 22, 2019, the closing price of our common stock was $27.02. Our stock price could decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the other risks discussed in this report and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nimpairment charges, changes in or loss of material contracts and relationships, dispositions or announcements of complementary acquisitions, or other business developments by us, our partners, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the tax preparation or wealth management markets or changes in market share;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndisclosures of any accounting issues, such as restatements or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nequity issuances resulting in the dilution of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new regulations or accounting standards;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity (whether justified or not) with respect to our business; and\n\u2022\nannouncements or publicity relating to litigation or governmental enforcement actions.\nIn addition, the equities market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and our stock has been particularly susceptible to such fluctuations. Often, class action litigation has been instituted against companies after periods of volatility in the price of such companies\u2019 stock. We have been defendants in such class action litigation in prior periods and could be subject to future litigation, potentially resulting in substantial cost and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur financial results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline.\nOur financial results have varied on a quarterly basis and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline. Many factors could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe inability of any of our businesses to implement business plans and to meet our expectations;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business and the resulting large quarterly fluctuations in our revenues;\n\u2022\nvariable demand for our services, rapidly evolving technologies and markets, and consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nthe level and mix of total client assets and advisory assets, which are subject to fluctuation based on market conditions and customer activity;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenues generated by existing businesses, discontinued operations or other businesses that we develop or acquire;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates affecting cash sweep revenue;\n\u2022\nvolatility in stock markets impacting the value of our advisory assets;\n\u2022\ngains or losses driven by fair value accounting;\n\u2022\nlitigation expenses and settlement costs;\n\u2022\nmisconduct by employees and/or HD Vest financial advisors, which is difficult to detect and deter;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in finding, evaluating, negotiating, consummating, and integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimpairment or negative performance of the many different industries and counterparties we rely on and are exposed to;\n\u2022\nany restructuring charges we may incur;\n\u2022\nany economic downturn, which could result in lower acceptance rates on premium products and services offered by our Wealth Management business and impact the commissions and fee revenues of our financial advisory services;\n\u2022\nnew court rulings, or the adoption of new or interpretation of existing laws, rules, or regulations, that adversely affect our business or that otherwise increase our potential liability or compliance costs;\n\u2022\nimpairment in the value of long-lived assets or the value of acquired assets, including goodwill, technology, and acquired contracts and relationships; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in accounting principles or standards or in our accounting treatment of revenues or expenses.\nFor these reasons, among others, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance. Furthermore, our fluctuating operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors and financial results volatility could make us less attractive to investors, either of which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nOur utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be severely limited or potentially eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal NOLs of $454.5 million that will expire primarily between 2020 and 2027, with the majority of them expiring between 2020 and 2024. We are currently able to offset all of our tax liabilities with our federal NOLs, but we may not generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize all of our NOLs prior to their expiration. If our federal NOLs expire unused, their full benefit will not be achieved. In addition, in years where our income exceeds our federal NOLs, which we expect to begin occurring in 2022, we will be required to make additional income tax payments.\nIn addition, if we were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (defined as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning five percent or more of a company\u2019s common stock over a three-year rolling period), then under certain conditions, the amount of NOLs we could use in any one year could be limited. Our certificate of incorporation imposes certain limited transfer restrictions on our common stock that we expect will assist us in preventing a change of ownership and preserving our NOLs, but there can be no assurance that these restrictions will be sufficient. In addition, other restrictions on our ability to use the NOLs may be triggered by a merger or acquisition, depending on the structure of such a transaction. It is our intention to limit the potential impact of these restrictions, but there can be no guarantee that such efforts will be successful.\nIf we are unable to use our federal NOLs before they expire, or if the use of this tax benefit is severely limited or eliminated, there could be a material reduction in the amount of after-tax income and cash flow from operations, and it could have an effect on our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. For example, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring us without the consent of our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our charter documents that could have an anti-takeover effect include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors, which is being phased out between 2017 and 2020, into three groups so that directors serve staggered three-year terms, which may make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for supermajority approval by stockholders for certain business combinations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote by stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholders\u2019 ability to call special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions in our certificate of incorporation on transfers of our common stock designed to preserve our federal NOLs.\nAt our 2009 annual meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that restricts any person or entity from attempting to transfer our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent stockholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent stockholder. This amendment provides that any transfer that violates its provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee to, upon our demand, transfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares.\nThis provision in our certificate of incorporation may make the acquisition of Blucora more expensive to the acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring Blucora without the approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 86544, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "BCOR"}
