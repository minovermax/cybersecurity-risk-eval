{"cik": "97134", "company": "TENNANT CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage organizational changes which could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are continuing to implement global standardized processes in our business despite lean staffing levels. We continue to consolidate and reallocate resources as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure in the current economy. Our operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to implement new processes and manage organizational changes, which includes changes to our go-to-market strategy, systems and processes, simultaneous focus on expense control and growth and introduction of alternative cleaning methods. In addition, if we do not effectively realize and sustain the benefits that these transformations are designed to produce, we may not fully realize the anticipated savings of these actions or they may negatively impact our ability to serve our customers or meet our strategic objectives.\nOur ability to effectively operate our Company could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other highly skilled employees, provide employee development opportunities and create effective succession planning strategies.\nOur growth strategy, expanding global footprint, changing workforce demographics and increased improvements in technology and business processes designed to enhance the customer experience are putting increased pressure on human capital strategies designed to recruit, retain and develop top talent.\nOur continued success will depend on, among other things, the skills and services of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, research, sales and marketing personnel also impacts our ability to effectively operate our business. As the economy recovers and companies grow and increase their hiring activities, there is an inherent risk of increased employee turnover and the loss of valuable employees in key positions, especially in emerging markets. We believe the increased loss of key personnel within a concentrated region could adversely affect our sales growth.\nIn addition, there is a risk that we may not have adequate talent acquisition resources and employee development resources to support our future hiring needs and provide training and development opportunities to all employees. This, in turn, could impede our workforce from embracing change and leveraging the improvements we have made in technology and other business process enhancements.\nWe are subject to competitive risks associated with developing innovative products and technologies, including but not limited to, not expanding as rapidly or aggressively in the global market as our competitors, our customers not continuing to pay for innovation and competitive challenges to our products, technology and the underlying intellectual property.\nOur products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, durability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, customer relationships and after-sale service. Although we believe that the performance and price characteristics of our products will produce competitive solutions for our customers\u2019 needs, our products are generally priced higher than our competitors\u2019 products. This is due to our dedication to innovation and continued investments in research and development. We believe that customers will pay for the innovations and quality in our products. However, it may be difficult for us to compete with lower priced products offered by our competitors and there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to choose our products over products offered by our competitors. If our products, markets and services are not competitive, we may experience a decline in sales volume, an increase in price discounting and a loss of market share, which adversely impacts revenues, margin and the success of our operations.\nCompetitors may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or claims, allege that we infringe upon their patents, violate our patents or they may use their resources to design comparable products that avoid infringing our patents. Regardless of whether such litigation is successful, such litigation could significantly increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in the cost of, quality, or disruption in the availability of, raw materials and components that we purchase to manufacture our products could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition.\nOur sales growth, expanding geographical footprint and continued use of sole source vendors (concentration risk), coupled with suppliers\u2019 potential credit issues, could lead to an increased risk of a breakdown in our supply chain. There is an increased risk of defects due to the highly configured nature of our purchased component parts that could result in quality issues, returns or production slow-downs. In addition, modularization may lead to more sole sourced products and as we seek to outsource the design of certain key components, we risk loss of proprietary control and becoming more reliant on a sole source. There is also a risk that the vendors we choose to supply our parts and equipment fail to comply with our quality expectations, thus damaging our reputation for quality and negatively impacting sales.\nThe SEC has adopted rules regarding disclosure of the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (commonly referred to as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in products we manufacture or contract to manufacture. These rules have required and will continue to require due diligence and disclosure efforts. There are and will continue to be costs associated with complying with this disclosure requirement, including costs to determine which of our products are subject to the rules and the source of any \"conflict minerals\" used in these products. Since our supply chain is complex, ultimately we may not be able to sufficiently discover the origin of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. If we are unable to or choose not to provide appropriate disclosure, customers may choose not to purchase our products. Alternatively, if we choose to use only suppliers offering conflict free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain metals, if necessary, from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Any one or a combination of these various factors could harm our business, reduce market demand for our products, and adversely affect our profit margins, net sales, and overall financial results.\nWe may not be able to upgrade and evolve our information technology systems as quickly as we wish and we may encounter difficulties as we upgrade and evolve these systems to support our growth strategy and business operations, which could adversely impact our abilities to accomplish anticipated future cost savings and better serve our customers.\nWe have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business and are in need of upgrading in order to effectively implement our growth strategy. Given our greater emphasis on customer-facing technologies, we may not have adequate resources to upgrade our systems at the pace which the current business environment demands. Additionally, significantly upgrading and evolving the capabilities of our existing systems could lead to inefficient or ineffective use of our technology due to lack of training or expertise in these evolving technology systems. These factors could lead to significant expenses, adversely impacting our results of operations and hinder our ability to offer better technology solutions to our customers.\nInadequate funding or insufficient innovation of new technologies may result in an inability to develop and commercialize new innovative products and services.\nWe strive to develop new and innovative products and services to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. New product development relies heavily on our financial and resource investments in both the short term and long term. If we fail to adequately fund product development projects or fund a project which ultimately does not gain the market acceptance we anticipated, we risk not meeting our customers' expectations, which could result in decreased revenues, declines in margin and loss of market share.\nWe may consider acquisition of suitable candidates to accomplish our growth objectives. We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire to achieve operational efficiencies, including synergistic and other benefits of acquisition.\nWe may consider, as part of our growth strategy, supplementing our organic growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. We have engaged in acquisitions in the past, such as the acquisition of the IPC Group, and we believe future acquisitions may provide meaningful opportunities to grow our business and improve profitability. Acquisitions allow us to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our products and services.\nHowever, our success in growing by acquisition is dependent upon identifying businesses to acquire, integrating the newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses and complying with the terms of our credit facilities. We may incur difficulties in the realignment and integration of business activities when assimilating the operations and products of an\nacquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings, revenue synergies and profit margins. Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity or otherwise perform as expected. We are also subject to incurring unanticipated liabilities and contingencies associated with an acquired entity that are not identified or fully understood in the due diligence process. Current or future acquisitions may not be successful or accretive to earnings if the acquired businesses do not achieve expected financial results.\nIn addition, we may record significant goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with an acquisition. We are required to perform impairment tests at least annually and whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows. If we determine that any intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values, this could result in a charge that may be material to our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nIn April 2017, in connection with the acquisition of IPC Cleaning S.p.A., we entered into a new senior credit facility and indenture, and issued debt totaling approximately $400,000, consisting of a $100,000 term loan and $300,000 of senior notes, which funded the acquisition and replaced our current debt facility. The new senior credit facility also includes a revolving facility in an amount up to $200,000. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, to pay dividends, to repurchase shares of our common stock, and to fund our general corporate and capital requirements.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance. We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business and other factors.\nOur current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. These consequences include, or may include, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022\nour funds available for operations, expansions, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.\nRestrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indenture place limits on our ability to conduct our business. Covenants in our senior credit facility and indenture include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements. The senior credit facility additionally contains certain financial covenants. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants in the future.\nWe may encounter financial difficulties if the United States or other global economies experience an additional or continued long-term economic downturn, decreasing the demand for our products and negatively affecting our sales growth.\nOur product sales are sensitive to declines in capital spending by our customers. Decreased demand for our products could result in decreased revenues, profitability and cash flows and may impair our ability to maintain our operations and fund our obligations to others. In the event of a continued long-term economic downturn in the U.S. or other global economies, our revenues could decline to the point that we may have to take cost-saving measures, such as restructuring actions. In addition, other fixed costs would have to be reduced to a level that is in line with a lower level of sales. A long-term economic downturn that puts downward pressure on sales could also negatively affect investor perception relative to our publicly stated growth targets.\nWe may encounter risks to our IT infrastructure, such as access and security, that may not be adequately designed to protect critical data and systems from theft, corruption, unauthorized usage, viruses, sabotage or unintentional misuse.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products and its customers. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, react to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems.\nDespite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to conduct business if we experience a significant business interruption in our computer systems, manufacturing plants or distribution facilities for a significant period of time.\nWe rely on our computer systems, manufacturing plants and distribution facilities to efficiently operate our business. If we experience an interruption in the functionality in any of these items for a significant period of time for any reason, we may not have adequate business continuity planning contingencies in place to allow us to continue our normal business operations on a long-term basis. In addition, the increase in customer facing technology raises the risk of a lapse in business operations. Therefore, significant long-term interruption in our business could cause a decline in sales, an increase in expenses and could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial, tax and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade, tax compliance, labor and safety and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S., but because we are a U.S. based company, oftentimes they are also subject to U.S. laws which can create a conflict. Despite our due diligence, there is a risk that we do not have adequate resources or comprehensive processes to stay current on changes in laws or regulations applicable to us worldwide and maintain compliance with those changes. Increased compliance requirements may lead to increased costs and erosion of desired profit margin. As a result, it is possible that the activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Business Ethics Guide. Violations of the U.S. or local laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the European Union adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (the \"GDPR\") in May 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR will become fully effective in May 2018. GDPR requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.\nActions of activist investors or others could disrupt our business.\nPublic companies have been the target of activist investors. One investor which owns approximately 5% of our outstanding common stock recently filed a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission which stated its belief that we should undertake a strategic review process regarding a consolidation transaction with a third party. In the event such investor or another third party, such as an activist investor, continues to pursue such belief or proposes to change our governance policies, board of directors, or other aspects of our operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may create a significant distraction for our management and employees. This could negatively impact our ability to execute our business plans and may require our management to expend significant time and resources. Such proposals may also create uncertainties with respect to our financial position and operations and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, could result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, net earnings, earnings per share and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies as we translate them into the U.S. dollar reporting currency. We use derivative financial instruments to hedge our estimated transactional or translational exposure to certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as well as our foreign currency denominated revenue. While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk in the normal course of business by utilizing various foreign exchange financial instruments, these instruments involve risk and may not effectively limit our underlying exposure from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or minimize the effects on our net earnings and the cash volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to product liability claims and product quality issues that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. If products are used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result leading to product liability claims against us. Some of our products or product improvements may have defects or risks that we have not yet identified that may give rise to product quality issues, liability and warranty claims. Quality issues may also arise due to changes in parts or specifications with suppliers and/or changes in suppliers. If product liability claims are brought against us for damages that are in excess of our insurance coverage or for uninsured liabilities and it is determined we are liable, our business could be adversely impacted. Any losses we suffer from any liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business and operating results. We could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that could warrant a recall of some of our products. Any unforeseen product quality problems could result in loss of market share, reduced sales and higher warranty expense.\nThe integration of IPC's operations into ours following its acquisition could create additional risks for our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe intend to integrate IPC into our control environment and subject it to internal control testing during 2018, which means that deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as a combined company may not be identified until then. Any such undiscovered deficiencies, if material, could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, declines in the trading price of our common stock or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75460, "SIC": 3580, "TIC": "TNC"}
