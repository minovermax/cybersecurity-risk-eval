{"cik": "850429", "company": "TREDEGAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The following risk factors should be considered, in addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, when evaluating Tredegar and its businesses.\nAluminum Extrusions\n\u2022\nSales volume and profitability of Aluminum Extrusions is cyclical and seasonal and highly dependent on economic conditions of end-use markets in the U.S., particularly in the construction sector. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 end-use markets can be cyclical and subject to seasonal swings in volume. Because of the capital intensive nature and level of fixed costs inherent in the aluminum extrusions business, the percentage drop in operating profits in a cyclical downturn will likely exceed the percentage drop in volume. In addition, during an economic slowdown, excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end-use markets as competitors protect their position with key customers. Any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts (including a greater chance of loss associated with customers defaulting on fixed-price forward sales contracts) that usually accompany a downturn. In addition, higher energy costs can further reduce profits unless offset by price increases or cost reductions and productivity improvements.\n\u2022\nFailure to prevent competitors from evading anti-dumping and countervailing duties, or a reduction in such duties, could adversely impact Aluminum Extrusions. Effective April 25, 2017, the anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty orders on aluminum extrusions were extended for a period of five years. The orders will be reviewed again beginning in March 2022. Chinese and other overseas manufacturers continue to try to evade the anti-dumping and countervailing orders to avoid duties. A failure by, or the inability of, U.S. trade officials to curtail the evasion of these duties, or the potential reduction of applicable duties pursuant to annual administrative reviews of the orders by the Department of Commerce, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nThe duty-free importation of goods allowed under USMCA could result in lower demand for aluminum extrusions made in the U.S., which could materially and negatively affect Bonnell Aluminum\u2019s business and results of operations. In March 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs of 10% on aluminum ingot and semi-finished aluminum imported in the U.S. from certain countries, including countries from which Bonnell Aluminum has historically sourced aluminum products. In September 2019, the United States, Canada and Mexico entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d). As a result of the 10% tariffs on aluminum ingot imported to the U.S. and the duty-free importation of goods allowed under USMCA, aluminum extrusions made in Canada and Mexico are free of the 10% tariff and can now be imported into and sold in the U.S. at very competitive prices. This could result in lower demand for aluminum extrusions made in the U.S., which could materially and negatively affect Bonnell Aluminum\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nCompetition from China could increase significantly if China is granted market economy status by the World Trade Organization. China launched a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) challenging its non-market economy status, claiming that as of December 11, 2016, China\u2019s transition period as a non-market economy under its Accession Protocol to the WTO ended. China believes with respect to all Chinese-made products that it should receive market economy status and the rights attendant to that status under WTO rules. The U.S. and the European Union have each rejected that interpretation. If China is granted market economy status by the WTO, the extent to which the U.S. anti-dumping laws will be able to limit unfair trade practices from China will likely be limited because the U.S. government will be forced to utilize Chinese prices and costs that do not reflect market principles in anti-dumping duty investigations involving China, which could ultimately limit the level of anti-dumping duties applied to unfairly traded Chinese imports. The volume of unfairly traded imports of Chinese aluminum extrusions could increase as a result and this, in turn, would likely create substantial pricing pressure on Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions. In June 2019, at China\u2019s request, after certain preliminary rulings in the case went against the Chinese position, the WTO indefinitely suspended the proceedings on the Chinese WTO complaint.\n\u2022\nThe markets for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products are highly competitive with product quality, service, delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors. Aluminum Extrusions has approximately 1,500 customers that are in a variety of end-use markets within the broad categories of building and construction, distribution, automotive and other transportation, machinery and equipment, electrical and consumer durables. No single customer exceeds 4% of Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 net sales. Future success and prospects depend on Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 ability to provide superior service, high quality products, timely delivery and competitive pricing to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross-cycle growth. Failure in any of these areas could lead to a loss of customers, which could have an adverse material effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.\nPE Films\n\u2022\nPE Films is highly dependent on sales associated with its top five customers, the largest of which is P&G. PE Films\u2019 top five customers comprised approximately 19%, 21% and 26% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with net sales to P&G alone comprising approximately 6%, 10% and 13% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss or significant reduction of sales associated with one or more of these customers without replacement by new business could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Other factors that could adversely affect the business include, by way of example, (i) failure by a key customer to achieve success or maintain share in markets in which they sell products containing PE Films\u2019 materials, including as a result of customer preferences for products other than plastics, (ii) key customers using products developed by others that replace PE Films\u2019 business with such customer, (iii) delays in a key customer rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by PE Films, (iv) operational decisions by a key customer that result in component substitution, inventory reductions and similar changes, and (v) the cyclicality of the electronic display markets. While PE Films is undertaking efforts to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with these large customers.\nPE Films anticipates that a portion of its film products used in surface protection applications could be made obsolete by possible future customer product transitions to less costly alternative processes or materials. These transitions principally relate to one customer. The full transition continues to encounter delays. The Company estimates that during the next four quarters the adverse impact on operating profit from this customer shift versus the last four quarters ended December 31, 2019 could possibly be $14 million. To offset the potential adverse impact, the Company is aggressively pursuing and making progress generating sales from new surface protection products, applications and customers.\nThe Company previously disclosed a significant customer product transition for the Personal Care component of PE Films. Annual sales for this product declined from approximately $70 million in 2018 to $30 million in 2019. The Company recently extended an arrangement with this customer that is expected to generate sales of this product at approximately 2019 levels through at least 2022.\nPersonal Care had approximately break-even EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) from ongoing operations in 2019 as competitive pressures resulted in missed sales and margin goals. Personal Care continues to focus on new business development and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to improve profitability. There can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that they will offset any loss of business due to product transitions and other lost sales.\n\u2022\nPE Films and its customers operate in highly competitive markets. PE Films competes on product innovation, quality, price and service, and its businesses and their customers operate in highly competitive markets. Global market conditions continue to exacerbate the Company\u2019s exposure to margin compression in its Personal Care business due to competitive forces, especially as certain personal care products move into the later stages of their product and intellectual protection life cycles. In addition, the changing dynamics of consumer products retailing, including the impact of on-line retailers such as Amazon, is creating price and margin pressure on the customers of PE Films\u2019 Personal Care business. While PE Films continually works to identify new business opportunities with new and existing customers, primarily through the development of new products with improved performance and/or cost characteristics, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that they will offset business lost from competitive dynamics or customer product transitions.\n\u2022\nCost saving initiatives may not achieve the results anticipated. PE Films has undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives to consolidate certain production, improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. PE Films cannot be certain that it will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. In addition, PE Films may not be successful in moving production to other facilities or timely qualifying new production equipment. Failure to complete these initiatives could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nFailure of PE Films\u2019 customers, who are subject to cyclical downturns, to achieve success or maintain market share could adversely impact PE Films\u2019 sales and operating margins. PE Films\u2019 plastic films serve as components for, or are used in the production of, various consumer products sold worldwide. A customer\u2019s ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market those products is integral to PE Films\u2019 success. Also, consumers of premium products made with or using PE Films\u2019 components may shift to less premium or less expensive products, reducing the demand for PE Films\u2019 plastic films. Cyclical downturns and changing consumer preferences for plastic products generally may negatively affect businesses that use PE Films\u2019 plastic film products, which could adversely affect sales and operating margins.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or its infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse impact on PE Films. PE Films operates in an industry where its significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios. The continued success of PE Films\u2019 business depends on its ability not only to protect its own technologies and trade secrets, but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents or threaten existing customer relationships. Intellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of Company resources, both of which could adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\n\u2022\nAn unstable economic environment could have a disruptive impact on PE Films\u2019 supply chain. Certain raw materials used in manufacturing PE Films\u2019 products are sourced from single suppliers, and PE Films may not be able to quickly or inexpensively re-source from other suppliers. The risk of damage or disruption to its supply chain may increase if and when different suppliers consolidate their product portfolios, experience financial distress or disruption of manufacturing operations (such as, for example, the impact of hurricanes on petrochemical production). Failure to take adequate steps to effectively manage such events, which are intensified when a product is procured from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to restore its supply chain.\nFlexible Packaging Films\n\u2022\nOvercapacity in Latin American polyester film production and a history of uncertain economic conditions in Brazil could adversely impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Flexible Packaging Films.\nFor flexible packaging films produced in Brazil, costs for operations in Brazil have been adversely impacted by inflation in Brazil that is higher than in the U.S. Flexible Packaging Films is exposed to additional foreign exchange translation risk because almost 90% of Flexible Packaging Films\u2019 Brazilian sales are quoted or priced in U.S. Dollars while a large part of its Brazilian costs are quoted or priced in Brazilian Real. This mismatch, together with a variety of economic variables impacting currency exchange rates, causes volatility that could negatively or positively impact profitability for Flexible Packaging Films. While Flexible Packaging Films hedges this exposure on a short-term basis with foreign exchange forward rate contracts, the exposure continues to exist beyond the hedging periods.\n\u2022\nGovernmental failure to extend anti-dumping duties in Brazil on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films. In recent years, excess global capacity in the industry has led to increased competitive pressures from imports into Brazil. The Company believes that these conditions have shifted the competitive environment from a regional to a global landscape and have driven price convergence and lower product margins for Flexible Packaging Films. Favorable anti-dumping rulings or countervailing duties are in effect for products imported from China, Egypt, India, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Peru and Bahrain. Competitors not currently subject to anti-dumping duties may choose to utilize their excess capacity by selling product in Brazil, which may result in pricing pressures that Flexible Packaging Films may not be able to offset with cost savings measures and/or manufacturing efficiency initiatives. There can be no assurance that efforts to extend anti-dumping duties beyond 2020 on products imported from China, India, Egypt and other countries will be successful.\nGeneral\n\u2022\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures increases the risk of a material misstatement in its consolidated financial statements, and its failure to meet its reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on its financial condition.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is an integral part of producing reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d the Company\u2019s management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the periods referred to therein as a result of\ncertain deficiencies that were determined to constitute material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Under the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, a material weakness in the design of monitoring controls indicates that the Company has not sufficiently developed and/or documented internal controls by which management can review and oversee the Company\u2019s financial information to detect and correct material errors or that the personnel responsible for performing the review did not have the sufficient skill set or knowledge of the subject matter to perform a proper assessment.\nAs discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d to remediate the material weaknesses, the Company, with the assistance of its outside consultant, is in the process of implementing certain changes to its internal controls and reviewing the entire control environment to help ensure that there are no other material weaknesses. The Company believes that its remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. However, remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening the Company\u2019s internal control environment will require a substantial effort throughout 2020 and, the Company anticipates, through the first quarter of 2021. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan. The Company cannot provide assurance, however, of when it will remediate all such weaknesses, nor can it be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. Moreover, the Company cannot provide assurance that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future.\nWhile the material weaknesses discussed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d did not result in material misstatements of the Company\u2019s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2018 or 2019, or any interim period during 2017, 2018 or 2019, any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and cause it to fail to meet its reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a negative impact on its financial condition.\n\u2022\nTredegar has an underfunded defined benefit (pension) plan. Tredegar sponsors a pension plan that covers certain hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. The plan was substantially frozen to new participants in 2007, and frozen to benefit accruals for active participants in 2014. As of December 31, 2019, the plan was underfunded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) measures by $100.4 million. Tredegar expects that it will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $12.3 million to its underfunded pension plan in 2020, and may be required to make higher cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with any of the covenants in the Company\u2019s $500 million revolving credit facility, which matures in June of 2024, could result in all debt under the agreement outstanding at such time becoming due and limiting its borrowing capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on consolidated financial condition and liquidity. The credit agreement governing Tredegar\u2019s revolving credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants that, if violated, could restrict the Company\u2019s operational and financial flexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, would result in all outstanding debt under the credit facility at such time becoming due, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s performance is influenced by costs incurred by its operating companies, including, for example, the cost of raw materials and energy. These costs include, without limitation, the cost of aluminum (the raw material on which Aluminum Extrusions primarily depends), resin (the raw material on which PE Films primarily depends), PTA and MEG (the raw materials on which Flexible Packaging Films primarily depends), natural gas (the principal fuel necessary for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 plants to operate), electricity and diesel fuel. Aluminum, resin and natural gas prices are volatile as shown in the charts in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases and contractual pass-through provisions, but there are no assurance that higher prices can effectively be passed through to customers or that Tredegar will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material and energy costs through price increases or pass-through arrangements. Further, the Company\u2019s cost control efforts may not be sufficient to offset any increases in raw material, energy or other costs.\n\u2022\nTredegar may not be able to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, meeting revenue, margin, working capital and capital expenditure expectations that substantially drive valuation, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from existing businesses, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and potential difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated operational improvements. Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to current and future governmental regulation, including environmental laws and regulations, and could become exposed to material liabilities and costs associated with such regulation. The Company is subject to regulation by local, state, federal and foreign governmental authorities. New laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws, including those relating to environmental matters (including global climate change and plastic products), and privacy matters, could subject Tredegar to significant additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs. Moreover, future developments in federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including environmental laws, are difficult to predict. Environmental laws and privacy restrictions have become and are expected to continue to become increasingly strict. As a result, Tredegar expects to be subject to new environmental and privacy laws and regulations. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes. See Environmental Regulation in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d for a further discussion of this risk factor.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Brazilian anti-corruption laws and similar anti-bribery\nlaws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could adversely affect our business and/or our reputation.\n\u2022\nMaterial disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact financial results. Tredegar believes its facilities are operated in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations and that the Company has implemented measures to minimize the risks of disruption at its facilities. Such a disruption could be a result of any number of events: an equipment failure with repairs requiring long lead times, labor stoppages or shortages, cybersecurity attacks, utility disruptions, constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials, and severe weather conditions. A material disruption in one of the Company\u2019s operating locations could negatively impact production and its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAn inability to renegotiate the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements could adversely impact its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 19% of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Tredegar may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or higher labor costs. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company\u2019s facilities in the future. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could negatively impact Tredegar\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. None of Tredegar\u2019s collective bargaining agreements expire before the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u2022\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, may be adversely affected by epidemics such as the recent coronavirus (or COVID-19) outbreak. We may face risks related to health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases. The outbreak of such a communicable disease could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries. For example, the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in China, has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic,\u201d has spread across the globe to many countries in which the Company does business and is impacting worldwide economic activity.\nA public health epidemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities, or that such epidemic may otherwise interrupt or impair business activities. For example, a majority of protective films made by the PE Films\u2019 Surface Protection unit are sold to customers who produce key components for flat panel displays. A significant proportion of that production and fabrication occurs in China. Although we have not had significant issues at our Surface Protection manufacturing plant in Guangzhou, China, there can be no assurance that COVID-19 will not impact our Surface Protection business as a result of the virus\u2019 potential impact on delays in production and transportation in, and other impacts on, the flat panel display industry and its supply chain. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our Surface Protection unit and the Company\u2019s other business units, the continued\nspread of COVID-19, the measures taken by the governments of countries affected, actions taken to protect employees, and the impact of the pandemic on various business activities in affected countries could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s valuation of its $7.5 million cost-basis investment in kal\u00e9o is volatile and uncertain. Tredegar uses the fair value method to account for its fully-diluted ownership interest of approximately 18% in kaleo, Inc. (\u201ckal\u00e9o\u201d), a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company. There is no active secondary market for buying or selling stock in kal\u00e9o. The Company\u2019s fair value estimates can fluctuate materially between reporting periods, primarily due to variances in kal\u00e9o\u2019s performance versus expectations and changes in the valuation of guideline public companies as measured by their enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiples. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in kal\u00e9o could decline. Public pressure to lower the price of pharmaceutical products and competitive pressures in the market could affect the price at which kal\u00e9o sells its products. The U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of kal\u00e9o\u2019s Evzio business in 2018, the impact of which on kal\u00e9o and on the value of the Company\u2019s interest in kal\u00e9o cannot yet be estimated with any certainty. Kal\u00e9o initiated a plan in 2019 to reduce the cost structure of the Evzio product line and reallocate resources to its allergy and pediatric product lines, principally Auvi-Q. As a result, kal\u00e9o substantially reduced commercial activities associated with Evzio in 2019. See Note 4 to the Notes to Financial Statements (\u201cNote 4\u201d) for more information.\n\u2022\nRising trade tensions could cause an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s products or otherwise negatively impact the Company. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s business involves imports to and from the U.S. and other countries where the Company produces and sells its products. Trade tensions have been rising between the U.S. and other countries, particularly China. An increase in tariffs and other trade barriers between the U.S. and China, or between the U.S. and other countries, could cause an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s products or otherwise negatively impact the production and sale of the Company\u2019s products in world markets.\n\u2022\nA failure in the Company\u2019s information technology systems as a result of cybersecurity attacks or other causes could negatively affect Tredegar\u2019s business. The Company depends on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) to record and process customers\u2019 orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, secure its production processes and know-how, maintain the financial accuracy of its business records and maintain personally identified information of its employees. An IT system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, or other malicious causes could disrupt our operations and prevent us from being able to process transactions with our customers, operate our manufacturing facilities and properly report transactions in a timely manner. Increased global IT security threats and cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security and availability of the Company\u2019s IT systems, networks, and services, including those that are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties, as well as to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. To date, interruptions of the Company\u2019s IT systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. A significant protracted failure of or security breach of the IT systems, networks, or service providers the Company relies upon, or a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, or personally identified information, as a result of a cybersecurity incident or other cause, could result in substantial costs to the Company, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, regulatory enforcement actions and lawsuits, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75649, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "TG"}
