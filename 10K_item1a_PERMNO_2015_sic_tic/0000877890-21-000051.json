RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe expansion of cloud-based solutions (as opposed to traditional on-premises delivery of our products) and our efforts to transition our customers from on-premise to the cloud, including the pace of that transition, has and will introduce a number of risks and uncertainties unique to such a shift in delivery, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpansion of our cloud-based solutions has required, and may continue to require, a considerable investment in resources, including technical, financial, legal, sales, information technology and operational systems. Additionally, market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: security, service availability, reliability, availability of tools to automate cloud migration, scalability, integration with public cloud platforms, customization, availability of qualified third-party service providers to assist customers in transitioning to our cloud-based solutions, performance, current license terms, customer preference, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations.\nWe may not meet our financial and strategic objectives if the pace that our customers transition to cloud-based solutions is slower than predicted. For instance, the transition of customers from our on-premises subscriptions to cloud-based offerings did not progress during the first half of 2020 at the rate we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, as many of our customers chose our on-premises subscriptions rather than migrating their Citrix Workspace deployments to our cloud-based offerings. To address the challenges in transitioning our customers to the cloud, we continue to invest in innovation and feature development, simplified cloud migration, and performance and reliability, as well as other cloud customer success and sales initiatives. There can be no assurance, however, that these initiatives will result in an increase in the transition of our customers from on-premises to our cloud-based solutions. If we are unable to transition our customers to cloud-based solutions at the pace we expect, we may experience a negative impact on our overall financial performance.\nIn addition, our cloud-based solutions are primarily operated through third-party cloud service providers, which we do not control and which may be subject to actual or perceived damage, interruption, vulnerabilities and other cyber-related risks. Customers of our cloud-based solutions need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide them with service level commitments with respect to uptime. Third-party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access, and therefore, we are, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party cloud providers\u2019 infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our cloud offering customers, which may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our security, or that of any of these third-party cloud providers, is compromised, our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It is possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a third-party cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third-party cloud provider. It may also become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as our software becomes more complex and the usage of our software increases.\nOur cloud-based solutions provide customers with increased visibility into the level of active use of such solutions by the customers\u2019 employees or other end users. This enhanced visibility may adversely impact renewal rates, if enough users in a customer organization do not actively engage with our solutions.\nIn addition, the pace of adoption by our customers of cloud-based solutions as opposed to on-premises delivery of our products has and will introduce a number of risks unique to such a shift, including:\n\u2022we may not be able to meet customer demand or solution requirements for cloud-based solutions;\n\u2022we may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we expand our cloud-based solutions thereby decreasing our gross margins;\n\u2022we may encounter customer concerns regarding changes to pricing, service availability, and security; and\n\u2022we may experience unpredictability in revenue as a result of usage fluctuations within our cloud service provider business.\nFurther, the success in transitioning our customers to our cloud-based solutions is dependent on our ability to effectively align, prioritize and allocate our engineering and other resources to balance the needs of maintaining our existing products, while also innovating in future products and features, and ensuring security and resiliency.\nAny of the above circumstances or events may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur multi-year transition from a perpetual licenses to a subscription-based business model is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been transitioning to a subscription-based business model over the past several years. We discontinued broad availability of perpetual licenses for Citrix Workspace in October 2020 and a large portion of our new business has transitioned to the subscription-based model. We offer our customers the option to acquire new Citrix Workspace licenses in the form of an on-premises subscription or cloud-based subscriptions. However, we will continue to support and renew existing maintenance contracts for the foreseeable future.\nAs we continue to transition our customers from perpetual licenses to subscriptions, we expect an impact on the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in operating margin and cash flows. Because subscription revenue related to our cloud-based solutions is typically recognized over time, we expect to continue to experience a near-term reduction in revenue and revenue growth as more customers move away from perpetual licenses to subscriptions. We also expect the mix shift within our App Delivery and Security business away from hardware towards software-based solutions will create pressure on reported App Delivery and Security revenue over time.\nFurther, while many of our subscription-based offerings involve multi-year commitments, ultimately our subscription customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of the subscription term, or to renew only for a portion of our solutions or on pricing terms that are less favorable to us. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline, fluctuate, or not improve as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our solutions, their ability to continue their operations and spending levels, the pricing of our solutions and the availability of competing solutions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions, demand pricing or other concessions prior to renewal, or if our renewal rates fluctuate or decline, our total bookings and revenue will fluctuate or decline, and our business and financial results will be negatively affected.\nIn addition, the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge. For example, we began reporting annualized recurring revenue in the second quarter of 2019 as a key performance indicator of the health and trajectory of our business. We believe that annualized recurring revenue represents the pace of our transition and serves as a leading indicator of revenue trends. Further, we continue to evaluate the metrics and key performance indicators that we use to measure our business internally and those that we provide as external disclosures, and there can be no guarantees that the metrics and key performance indicators that we use internally or disclose externally will prove successful in helping us manage our business or understand important trends. The transition to a subscription-based business model also means that our historical results, especially those achieved before we began the transition, may be difficult to compare to our future results. As a result, investors and financial analysts may have difficulty understanding the shift in our business model, resulting in changes in financial estimates or failure to meet investor expectations. Moreover, we forecast our future revenue and operating results and provide financial projections based on a number of assumptions, including a forecasted rate of subscription bookings, as well as the mix within subscription of on-premise versus cloud. If any of our assumptions about our business model transition or the estimated mix within subscription of on-premise versus cloud are incorrect, our revenue and operating results may be impacted and could vary materially from those we provide as guidance or from those anticipated by investors and analysts. If we are unable to navigate our transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nA significant portion of our revenues historically has come from our Application Virtualization and VDI solutions and our App Delivery and Security products, and decreases in sales for these solutions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenues has historically come from our Application Virtualization and VDI solutions and App Delivery and Security products. We continue to anticipate that sales of these solutions and products and related enhancements and upgrades will constitute a majority of our revenue for the near future. Declines and variability in sales of certain of these solutions and products could occur as a result of:\n\u2022new competitive product releases and updates to existing products delivered as on premises solutions, especially cloud-based products;\n\u2022industry trend to focus on the secure delivery of applications on mobile devices;\n\u2022introduction of new or alternative technologies, products or service offerings by third parties;\n\u2022termination or reduction of our product offerings and enhancements;\n\u2022potential market saturation;\n\u2022failure to enter new markets;\n\u2022price and product competition resulting from rapid and frequent technological changes and customer needs;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022complexities and cost in implementation;\n\u2022failure to deliver satisfactory technical support;\n\u2022failure of our technology to advance our customers\u2019 energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions goals;\n\u2022dissatisfied customers; or\n\u2022lack of commercial success of our technology relationships.\nWe have experienced increased competition in the Application Virtualization and VDI business from directly competing solutions, alternative products and products on new platforms. For example, AWS and VMware both provide offerings that compete with our solutions, among numerous other competitors. Also, there continues to be an increase in the number of alternatives to Windows operating system powered desktops, in particular mobile devices such as Chromebooks, smartphones and tablets. Users may increasingly turn to these devices to perform functions that would have been traditionally performed on desktops and laptops, which in turn may reduce the market for our Application Virtualization and VDI solutions. Further, increased use of certain SaaS applications may result in customers relying less on Windows applications. If sales of our Application Virtualization and VDI solutions decline as a result of these or other factors, our revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nSimilarly, we have experienced increased competition for our App Delivery and Security products, including our core Citrix ADC solution. For example, there are an increasing number of alternatives to traditional ADC hardware solutions, enabling our customers to build internal solutions, rely on open source technology or leverage software and cloud-based offerings. In addition, our App Delivery and Security business generates a substantial portion of its revenues from a limited number of customers with uneven and declining purchasing patterns. As a result, the potential for declining sales within our App Delivery and Security business may not be offset by gains in our other businesses, which could result in our operations and financial condition being adversely affected.\nIf our Workspace strategy is not successful in addressing our customers\u2019 evolving needs beyond traditional Application Virtualization and VDI solutions or we face substantial technological or implementation challenges with our Workspace offerings, we may be unable to expand our user base and our financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nOur success depends on customer and user adoption of our newer products and services. Increased adoption will depend on our ability to deliver a Workspace platform that provides value and use cases beyond traditional Application Virtualization and VDI solutions. The market for solutions that meet our customers\u2019 needs in accessing and organizing their work in a secure way is evolving and dynamic.\nFurther, our growth strategy with respect to our Workspace offerings includes expanding the use of our platform through integrations with a variety of network, hardware and software systems, including human resource information and enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management systems, including through the interaction of application programming interfaces (APIs). While we have established relationships with providers of complementary technology offerings and software integrations, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining relationships with these providers or establishing relationships with new providers. Third-party providers of complementary technology offerings and software integrations may decline to enter into, or may later terminate, relationships with us; change their features or platforms; restrict our access to their applications and platforms; or alter the terms governing use of and access to their applications and APIs in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party technology offerings and software integrations with our platform, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. Further, we recently have undertaken efforts to build a developer community around our Workspace platform. However, our developer community is new and it remains unclear if it will successfully generate third-party developer interest in creating new integrations or additional uses for our services.\nDelivering our new solutions and our Workspace vision presents technological and implementation challenges, and may fail to meet our customers' needs. Significant investments continue to be required to develop or acquire solutions to address those challenges. To the extent that our newer products and services are adopted more slowly or are displaced by competitive solutions offered by other companies, our revenue growth rates may slow materially or our revenue may decline substantially, we may fail to realize returns on our investments in new initiatives and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition, which could result in customer loss, fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins.\nWe sell our solutions and services in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. We compete based on our ability to offer to our customers the most current and desired solution and services features. We expect that competition will continue to be intense, and there is a risk that our competitors\u2019 products may be less costly, more heavily discounted or free, provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our solutions. Additionally, there is a risk that our solutions may become outdated or that our market share may erode. Further, the announcement of the release, and the actual release, of new solutions incorporating similar features to our solutions could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future solution and service offerings. Existing or new solutions and services that provide alternatives to our solutions and services could materially impact our ability to compete in these markets. As the markets for our solutions and services, especially those solutions in early stages of development, continue to develop, additional companies, including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware, software, cloud, networking, mobile, data sharing and related industries, could enter, or increase their footprint in, the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition will remain a significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter our markets and as our current competitors seek to increase market share. Further, we may see new and increased competition in different geographic regions. The generally low barriers to entry in certain of our businesses increase the potential for challenges from new industry competitors, whether small and medium-sized businesses or larger, more established companies. Smaller companies new to our market may have more flexibility to develop on more agile platforms and have greater ability to adapt their strategies and cost structures, which may give them a competitive advantage with our current or prospective customers. We may also experience increased competition from new types of solutions as the options for Workspace and App Delivery and Security offerings increase. Further, as our industry evolves and if our company grows, companies with which we have strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas, or our current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase the competitive pressures we face.\nIn addition, the industry has been volatile and there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect companies will attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving and volatile industry. For example, some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had previously offered. Additionally, as IT companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in the evolving digital workspace services, networking and data sharing markets, these companies continue to seek to deliver comprehensive IT solutions to end users and combine enterprise-level hardware and software solutions that may compete with our Workspace and App Delivery and Security solutions. These consolidators or potential consolidators may have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources and brand loyalty than we do, and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary solutions and services. The companies resulting from these possible combinations may create more compelling solution and service offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility or sales and marketing support for such offerings than we can. These heightened competitive pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues or revenue growth rates, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a description of our competition.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services or cyberattacks on our services infrastructure or corporate networks could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUse of our products and services has and may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain instances our own and our customers' and other parties\u2019 business, financial and personal data. As we continue to evolve our products and features, we expect to host, transmit or otherwise have access to increasing amounts of potentially sensitive data. For example, we have recently added, and expect to continue to add, intelligence features to our Workspace offering that involve connections into a customer\u2019s systems and applications, including enterprise resource planning and human resource management tools. Maintaining the security of our products, computer networks and data storage resources is important and service vulnerabilities could result in loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have in the past, and may in the future, discover vulnerabilities in our products or underlying technology, which could expose our reputation, our operations and our customers to risk. In addition, to the extent we are diverting our resources to address and mitigate these vulnerabilities, it may hinder our ability to deliver and support our products and customers in a timely manner. For example, in December 2019, we discovered a vulnerability in our Citrix Application Delivery Controller, Citrix Gateway and certain\ndeployments of Citrix SD-WAN that would have allowed an unauthenticated attacker to perform arbitrary code execution. In response, we published a security advisory with detailed mitigations designed to stop a potential attack across all known scenarios and also developed and made available fixes to address this vulnerability, and such efforts required significant investment of resources across the company.\nAs a more general matter, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, alter, disclose, delete or otherwise compromise our confidential information or that of our employees, partners, customers or their end users, create system disruptions, product or service vulnerabilities or cause shutdowns. These unauthorized parties are becoming increasingly sophisticated, particularly those funded by or acting as formal or informal representatives of, or acting in conjunction with, nation states. Perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that directly or indirectly attack our products, services, infrastructure (including third-party cloud service providers - such as Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud Platform - upon which we rely), third-party software and applications that we deploy in our internal network. Because techniques used by these perpetrators to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems change frequently and sometimes are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Despite our efforts to build secure services, we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises. Like many enterprises, we experience attempted attacks on our network and services, and certain of those attacks have resulted in successful unauthorized access to our networks and services, including a \u201cpassword spraying\u201d attack in 2019 and a \u201ccredential stuffing\u201d attack in 2018.\nThese misappropriations, cyberattacks or any other compromises of our security measures (or those of one of our customers) as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, vulnerabilities, theft, malfeasance or otherwise could result in (among other consequences):\n\u2022loss or destruction of customer, employee, partner and other Citrix intellectual property or business data;\n\u2022disruptions in the operation of our business, such as interruption in the delivery of our cloud and other services;\n\u2022costs associated with investigating, responding to and remediating the root cause, including additional monitoring of systems for unauthorized activity;\n\u2022negative publicity and harm to our reputation or brand, which could result in lost trust from our customers, partners and employees and could lead some customers to seek to cancel subscriptions, stop using certain of our products or services, reduce or delay future purchases of our products or services, or use competing products or services;\n\u2022individual and/or class action lawsuits, due to, among other things, the compromise of sensitive employee or customer information, which could result in financial judgments against us or the payment of settlement amounts and cause us to incur legal fees and costs;\n\u2022regulatory enforcement action in the United States at both the federal and state level (such as by the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorneys general) or globally under the growing number of data protection legal regimes, including without limitation the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, or other similar federal, state or local laws, which could result in significant fines and/or penalties or other sanctions and which would cause us to incur legal fees and costs;\n\u2022costs associated with responding to those impacted by such issues, such as: costs of providing data owners, consumers or others with notice; legal fees; costs of any additional fraud detection activities required by such customers' credit card issuers; and costs incurred by credit card issuers associated with the compromise;\n\u2022disputes with our insurance carriers concerning coverage for the costs associated with responding to, and mitigating an incident; and/or\n\u2022longer-term remediation and security enhancement expenses.\nAny of these actions could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, while we maintain multiple layers of oversight over enterprise cybersecurity and data protection risks associated with our products, services, information technology infrastructure and related operations - including our management-level cybersecurity risk oversight committee comprised of senior executives across core functions, as well as our Technology, Data and Information Security Committee of the Board - there is no guarantee that this oversight framework will be successful in providing the necessary governance to prevent or adequately respond to the actions described above.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and such effects will depend on future developments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic, the severity of the disease and outbreak, the impact of new strains of the virus, effectiveness and availability of a vaccine, future and ongoing actions that may be taken by governmental\nauthorities, the impact on the businesses of our customers and partners, and the length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and are difficult to predict at this time. The potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, include:\n\u2022 the rate of IT spending and the ability of our customers to purchase our offerings could be adversely impacted. Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and cause them to become less inclined to trade-up from existing solutions, impact customers\u2019 pricing expectations for our offerings, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or adversely impact renewal rates;\n\u2022 we could experience disruptions in our operations as a result of continued office closures, risks associated with our employees working remotely, a significant portion of our workforce suffering illness and travel restrictions. Starting in early 2020, we temporarily closed Citrix offices, instituted a global remote work mandate and instituted significant travel restrictions. While we have begun to re-open some of our offices, the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely and for our offices that have begun to re-open, we have implemented significant new safety protocols, which may limit the effectiveness and productivity of our employees;\n\u2022 we may be unable to collect amounts due on billed and unbilled revenue if our customers or partners delay payment or fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses, including their seeking bankruptcy protection or other similar relief. As a result, our cash flows could be adversely impacted, which could affect our ability to fund future product development and acquisitions or return capital to shareholders. Further, our ability to obtain outside financing or raise additional capital may be limited as a result of volatility in the financial markets during and following the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow or our financial condition deteriorates, we may be unable to service our debt arrangements or comply with the covenants set forth in our debt arrangements;\n\u2022 we may experience disruptions or delays to our supply chain or fulfillment and delivery operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we rely on a concentrated number of third-party suppliers and delivery vendors for our App Delivery and Security products, and may experience disruptions from the temporary closure of third-party supplier and manufacturer facilities, interruptions in product supply, restrictions on export or shipment or disruptions in product fulfillment due to closure or delays of our delivery vendors;\n\u2022 our marketing effectiveness and demand generation efforts may be impacted due to the cancelling of customer events or shifting events to virtual-only experiences. For example, we made the decision to replace our largest annual customer and partner event, Synergy, with a series of virtual-only events. We may need to postpone or cancel other customer, employee or industry events or other marketing initiatives in the future;\n\u2022 our business is dependent on attracting and retaining highly skilled employees, and our ability to attract and retain such employees may be adversely impacted by intensified restrictions on travel, immigration, or the availability of work visas during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 increased cyber incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic and our increased reliance on a remote workforce could increase our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches and attacks; and/or\n\u2022 our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which risks may be heightened due to increased volatility of foreign currency exchange rates as a result of COVID-19.\nFurther, our forecasted revenue, operating results and cash flows could vary materially from those we provide as guidance or from those anticipated by investors and analysts if the assumptions on which we base our financial projections are inaccurate as a result of the unpredictability of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our businesses, our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 businesses and the global markets and economy or we make changes to our licensing programs or payment terms in connection with COVID-19. For example, we experienced increased demand for our solutions in the first half of 2020 primarily as a result of our decision to make limited use Workspace licenses of Citrix Workspace available in the form of shorter-duration, discounted on-premises term offerings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the transition of customers from on-premises subscriptions to cloud-based offerings did not progress during the first half of 2020 at the rate we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, as many of our customers chose on-premises subscriptions rather than migrating their Citrix Workspace deployments to cloud-based subscriptions, which we believe was primarily a consequence of our customers\u2019 priorities in light of the early phases of the pandemic. While this global health crisis may cause companies and their employees to change the way they think about remote work over the longer-term, demand for our products may decrease as a vaccine becomes widely available and social distancing restrictions abate. As a result, the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period is not an indication of our future performance.\nIn the aftermath of the pandemic, we are preparing for the likelihood that an increasing number of our employees may continue to work remotely, and may not require physical office space in order to perform their work. If so, we may reduce our physical office space requirements resulting in the possibility of additional near-term expense and accounting charges.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factor\u201d Section.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market in which we operate.\nThe markets for our solutions and services are characterized by:\n\u2022rapid technological change;\n\u2022evolving industry standards;\n\u2022fluctuations in customer demand;\n\u2022changing customer business models and increasingly sophisticated customer needs; and\n\u2022frequent new solution and service introductions and enhancements.\nThe demand for our solutions and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business-related computer appliances and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending levels, the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers, and general economic conditions. As we continue to grow our subscription service offerings, we must continue to innovate and develop new solutions and features to meet changing customer needs. Our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers\u2019 increasing technological requirements could lower the demand for any solutions and services and/or make our solutions uncompetitive and obsolete. Moreover, the purchase of our solutions and services is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. We need to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which will require us to devote significant resources.\nU.S. economic forecasts for the IT sector are uncertain and continue to highlight an industry in transition from legacy platforms to mobile, cloud, data analytics and social solutions. If our current and prospective customers cut costs, they may significantly reduce their IT expenditures. Additionally, if our current and prospective customers shift their IT spending more rapidly towards newer technologies and solutions as mobile, cloud, data analytics and social platforms evolve, the demand for our solutions and services most aligned with legacy platforms (such as our desktop virtualization solutions) could decrease. Fluctuations in the demand for our solutions and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulation of privacy and data security may adversely affect sales of our products and services and result in increased compliance costs.\nThere has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, increased regulation with respect to the collection, use and handling of personal, financial, government and other information. An increasing number of regulatory authorities in the United States and around the world have recently passed or are currently considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, privacy and data security. This includes the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020, the GDPR, which is a European Union-wide legal framework to govern data collection, use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights that became effective in May 2018, and the U.S. Department of Defense Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification framework. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The GDPR provides significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 4% of global revenue). European data protection authorities have already imposed fines for GDPR violations up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of Euros. Many states in the United States are also considering their own privacy laws that, in the absence of a preemptive Federal privacy law, could impose burdensome and conflicting requirements. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws, as well as cybersecurity requirements, and industry standards in the United States, Europe and elsewhere can be uncertain and currently is in flux. Cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, including data localization requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data, the operational and cost impact of which cannot be fully known at this time. In addition to the possibility of fines, application of these existing laws in a manner inconsistent with our data and privacy practices could result in an order requiring that we change our data and privacy practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial implementation and compliance costs and/or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Also, any new law or regulation, or interpretation of existing law or regulation, imposing greater fees or taxes or restriction on the collection, use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the Web, could result in a decline in the use and adversely affect sales of our solutions and our results of operations. Finally, as a technology vendor, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices, and our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers, particularly customers in highly-regulated industries, and could result in regulatory actions, fines, legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand, reputation and our business.\nOur solutions could contain errors that could delay the release of new products or otherwise adversely impact our products and services.\nDespite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers, our products and services, especially new products and services or releases or acquired products or services, do contain errors or \"bugs\". In some cases, these errors are not discovered until after commercial shipments or deployments have been made. Errors in our products or services could delay the development or release of new products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products and services. Additionally, our products and services use, integrate with and otherwise depend on third-party products, which third-party products could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless. Because our products and services are often used in mission-critical applications, errors in our products or services or the products or services of third parties upon which our products or services rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our offerings have sales cycles which are long and/or unpredictable which could cause significant variability and unpredictability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.\nGenerally, a substantial portion of our large and medium-sized customers implement our solutions on a departmental or enterprise-wide basis. We have a long sales cycle for these departmental or enterprise-wide sales because:\n\u2022our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large-scale deployment of our solution to potential and existing customers prior to sale;\n\u2022our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our solutions and services;\n\u2022our customers are typically large and medium-sized organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure; and\n\u2022before making a purchase, our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations, and this process can be lengthy.\nOur long sales cycle for these solutions makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur, and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis. In addition, the long sales cycle for these solutions makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our bookings, revenue and/or operating results for any particular period, and large projects with significant IT components may fail to meet our customers\u2019 business requirements or be canceled before delivery, which likewise could adversely affect our revenue and operating results for any particular period.\nOverall, the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. Our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter\u2019s total sales occur in the last month, weeks and days of each quarter. In addition, our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and such fluctuations are generally most significant in our fourth fiscal quarter, which we believe is due to the impact on revenue from the availability (or lack thereof) in our customers\u2019 fiscal year budgets and an increase in expenses resulting from amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans as performance milestones are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. In addition, our European operations generally generate lower sales in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer.\nChanges to our licensing or subscription renewal programs, or bundling of our solutions, could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue.\nWe continually re-evaluate our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions, to market our current and future solutions and services. We could implement new licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including promotional trade-up programs or offering specified enhancements to our current and future solution and service lines. Such changes could result in deferring revenue recognition until the specified enhancement is delivered or at the end of the contract term as opposed to upon the initial shipment or licensing of our software solution. We could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances, for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period, including offering additional solutions in a SaaS model. Changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including the timing of the release of enhancements, upgrades, maintenance releases, the term of the contract, discounts, promotions, auto-renewals and other factors, could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our solutions, related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSales and renewals of our support solutions constitute a large portion of our deferred revenue.\nWe anticipate that sales and renewals of our support solutions will continue to constitute a substantial portion of our deferred revenue. Our ability to continue to generate both recognized and deferred revenue from our support solutions will depend on our customers continuing to perceive value in automatic delivery of our software upgrades and enhancements. The discontinued broad availability of perpetual licenses for Citrix Workspace in October 2020 resulted in the loss of future opportunities to sell support solutions. Additionally, a decrease in demand for our support solutions could occur as a result of a decrease in demand for our Workspace and App Delivery and Security solutions or transition to our subscription-based solutions. If our customers do not continue to purchase our support solutions, our deferred revenue would decrease significantly and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control.\nWe rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our solutions and services. Our distributors generally sell through resellers. Our distributor and reseller base is relatively concentrated. We maintain and periodically revise our sales incentive programs for our independent distributors and resellers, and such program revisions may adversely impact our results of operations. Changes to our sales incentive programs can result from a number of factors, including our transition to a subscription-based business model. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in providing incentives to current or potential distributors and resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our solutions. The loss of or reduction in sales to our distributors or resellers could materially reduce our revenues. Further, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors. The financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations. Any significant delays, defaults or terminations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are in the process of diversifying our base of channel relationships by adding and training more channel partners with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers and additional mid-market customers and to sell our newer solutions and services. We are also in the process of building relationships with new types of channel partners, such as systems integrators and service providers. In addition to this diversification of our partner base, we will need to maintain a healthy mix of channel members who service smaller customers. We may need to add and remove distribution partners to maintain customer satisfaction, support a steady adoption rate of our solutions, and align with our transition to a subscription-based business model, which could increase our operating expenses, credit risk, and adversely impact our go-to-market effectiveness. In addition, our newer Workspace offerings may require additional technical capabilities to efficiently implement our solutions, and there is no guarantee we will be able to find a sufficient number of capable partners who can support these efforts. We also bear the risk that our existing or newer channel partners will fail to comply with US or international anti-corruption or anti-competition laws, in which case we might be fined or otherwise penalized as a result of the agency relationship with such partners. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to develop these channel relationships, which could adversely impact our results of operations if such channels do not result in increased revenues.\nOur App Delivery and Security business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware or hardware components from our third-party sources.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of third-party suppliers, who provide hardware or hardware components for our App Delivery and Security products, and contract manufacturers. If we are required to change suppliers, there could be a delay in the supply of our hardware or hardware components and our ability to meet the demands of our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of App Delivery and Security sales and existing or potential customers and delayed revenue recognition all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we have not, to date, experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our App Delivery and Security products, our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, or the need to implement costly or time-consuming protocols to comply with applicable regulations (including regulations related to conflict minerals), equipment malfunction, natural disasters and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain, and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining a diverse, global population of highly-skilled engineering, technical and security professionals, and managerial, sales and services, finance and marketing personnel are critical to our future, and global competition for experienced and diverse employees can be intense. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we\nmust provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. If we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity compensation in a competitive manner, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened or we would otherwise need to increase our use of cash-based compensation and awards to achieve the same attraction, retention and motivation benefits. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must also provide a diverse and inclusive environment, and offer benefits to support our employees\u2019 physical and mental health. Our inability to do so may limit our effectiveness in attracting, retaining and motivating our executives and key employees. Failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of solutions in our industry. The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring may harm our business and results of operations.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. We have experienced significant changes in our senior management team over the past several years, including the appointments of Mark Schmitz as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in 2019, Arlen R. Shenkman as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in 2019, Sridhar Mullapudi as our Executive Vice President, Product Management in 2020, Hector Lima as our Executive Vice President, Customer Experience in 2020, and Woong Joseph Kim as our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer in 2020. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur international presence subjects us to additional risks that could harm our business.\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support, development and engineering operations in countries outside of the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 50.5% of our net revenues from sales outside the United States. Potential growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations. To successfully maintain and expand international sales, we may need to establish additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could adversely affect the results of our international operations. These risks include:\n\u2022compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements, including the requirement to submit additional technical information for product registration in order to sell in certain countries;\n\u2022variability of foreign economic, political, labor conditions and global policy uncertainty, including re-locating operations internationally;\n\u2022changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by U.S. export laws;\n\u2022regional data privacy, security, secrecy and related laws that apply to the transmission of and protection of our and our customers\u2019 data across international borders;\n\u2022health or similar issues such as pandemic or epidemic;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing and protecting intellectual property rights, including increased difficulty as a foreign entity in those international locations;\n\u2022providing technical information in order to obtain foreign filing licenses for filing our patent applications in certain countries;\n\u2022increased risk of non-compliance by foreign employees, partners, distributors, resellers and agents or other intermediaries with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, U.S. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import control laws and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic internationally and related legal restrictions imposed in foreign nations;\n\u2022expansion of cloud-based products and services may increase risk in countries where cloud computing infrastructures are more susceptible to data intrusions or may be controlled directly or indirectly by foreign governments;\n\u2022our software and data of our customers being stored in foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to us being required to disclose or provide access to data or intellectual property to a foreign government pursuant to national security or other laws of such foreign jurisdiction; and\n\u2022as we generate cash flow in non-U.S. jurisdictions, if required, we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner.\nAdditionally, an increasing number of jurisdictions are imposing data localization laws, which require personal information, or certain subcategories of personal information, to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. These regulations may deter customers from using cloud-based services such as ours, and may inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. Specifically, we operate in Russia where there is a local residency requirement for personal data. We do not own or operate servers in Russia. As such, to-date, we have not offered our cloud-based offerings in Russia. Further, if we complete our acquisition of Wrike, our employee presence in Russia will increase, thereby adding to our exposure to certain of the risks identified herein, including risks related to the political, security and policy uncertainty between the United States and Russia.\nWe operate and do business in China. Under the China Cyber Security Law, or CSL, network operators are required to provide technical support and assistance to public and state security authorities in national security and criminal investigations. The law does not provide details on the extent of technical support and assistance that may be required. There is the possibility that network operators may be required to disclose or provide access to information or data communicated or transmitted through the network owned, utilized or managed by the network operator to comply with the support and assistance requirement of the CSL. While we do not consider Citrix to be a network operator, there is the possibility that China could decide to treat Citrix as a network operator, and we would need to comply with this law.\nWe have had and may, from time to time, enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures, OEM or similar business relationships with entities in foreign jurisdictions, including governmental or quasi-governmental entities, pursuant to which we may be required to license or transfer certain of our intellectual property rights to such entities. Such relationships could expose us to increased risks inherent in such activities, such as protection of our intellectual property, economic and political risks, and contractual enforcement issues.\nWe are also monitoring developments related to the decision by the British government to leave the European Union (EU) following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the EU (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), which could have implications for our business. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member state of the EU on January 31, 2020, and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered into by the United Kingdom and the EU ended on December 31, 2020. Brexit could lead to economic and legal uncertainty, including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and increasingly divergent laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these risks. We cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nAdverse changes in global economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a globally operated company, we are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and market conditions. Economic uncertainty and volatility in our significant geographic locations, including the potential impact resulting from \"Brexit\", a US-China trade war or other international trade disputes, or military conflict may adversely affect sales of our solutions and services and may result in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of technologies and increased price competition. For example, if the U.S. or the European Union countries were to experience an economic downturn, these adverse economic conditions could contribute to a decline in our customers\u2019 spending on our solutions and services. Additionally, in response to economic uncertainty, we expect that many governmental organizations that are current or prospective customers for our solutions and services would cutback spending significantly, which would reduce the amount of government spending on IT and demand for our solutions and services from government organizations. Adverse economic conditions also may negatively impact our ability to obtain payment for outstanding debts owed to us by our customers or other parties with whom we do business.\nRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS AND DIVESTITURES\nAcquisitions and divestitures present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate.\nWe have in the past addressed, and may continue to address, the development of new solutions and services and enhancements to existing solutions and services through acquisitions of other companies, product lines and/or technologies. For example, on January 16, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wrike, a SaaS collaborative work management solution company. Completion of the acquisition of Wrike is subject to various regulatory approvals and closing conditions. No assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits of the merger. Refer to Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d and Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a description of our pending acquisition of Wrike.\nAcquisitions, including those of high-technology companies, such as Wrike, are inherently risky. We cannot provide any assurance that any of our acquisitions or future acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals. The risks we commonly encounter in undertaking, managing and integrating acquisitions, including Wrike, are:\n\u2022an uncertain revenue and earnings stream from the acquired company, which could dilute our earnings;\n\u2022difficulties and delays integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, solutions and systems of the acquired companies;\n\u2022difficulties operating acquired companies as a stand-alone business, if desired, to further our objectives and strategy;\n\u2022undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third-party\u2019s code in solutions of the acquired companies;\n\u2022our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;\n\u2022challenges with implementing adequate and appropriate controls, procedures and policies in the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties managing or integrating an acquired company\u2019s technologies or lines of business;\n\u2022potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in-process research and development;\n\u2022entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions and which are highly competitive;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022potential difficulties integrating the acquired solutions and services into our sales channel or challenges selling acquired products;\n\u2022assuming pre-existing contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business;\n\u2022being subject to unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired company\u2019s practices;\n\u2022potential difficulties securing financing necessary to consummate substantial acquisitions;\n\u2022incurring a significant amount of debt to finance an acquisition, which would increase our debt service requirements, expense and leverage;\n\u2022issuing shares of our stock, which may be dilutive to our stockholders;\n\u2022issuing equity awards to, or assuming existing equity awards of, acquired employees, which may more rapidly deplete share reserves available under our shareholder-approved equity incentive plans;\n\u2022intellectual property claims or disputes; and\n\u2022litigation arising from the transaction.\nOur failure to successfully integrate acquired companies due to these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate transactions, or successfully operate acquired companies on a stand-alone basis, that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. For example, with respect to the pending acquisition of Wrike, we may not be able to accelerate our strategy and cloud transition, enhance our growth or accelerate Wrike\u2019s growth expectations, provide complementary solutions that are purchased by our or Wrike\u2019s customers, reach new users and expand our customer base, compete effectively in Wrike's markets, or realize other expected benefits of the merger if we are unable to successfully integrate and operate Wrike if the acquisition is completed.\nAny future divestitures we make may also involve risks and uncertainties. Any such divestitures could result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such divestiture. For example, in connection with a divestiture, we may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships, including long-term services arrangements, or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction, which may result in additional expense. Further, if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our operating results and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nIf we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets, including technology purchased in acquisitions, are impaired, we would be required to take a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, such as product related intangible assets, from our acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. However, we do amortize certain product related technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles and we periodically evaluate them for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value, at the reporting unit level, which for us also represents our operating segments. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets, including estimating future\ncash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, estimating the applicable tax rates, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, projecting the future industry trends and market conditions, and making other assumptions. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates, materially affect our results of operations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, including changes in our reporting structure, could materially affect our determinations of fair value. In addition, due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill and other intangible assets could change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Also, we may make divestitures of businesses in the future. If we determine that any of the intangible assets associated with our acquisitions is impaired or goodwill is impaired, then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a charge to current earnings. If we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets, or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future, our stock price and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inability to maintain or develop our strategic and technology relationships could adversely affect our business.\nWe have several strategic and technology relationships with large and complex organizations, such as Microsoft, Google and other companies with which we work to offer complementary solutions and services. We depend on the companies with which we have strategic relationships to successfully test our solutions, to incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those solutions. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic relationships or that they will continue in the future. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, such relationships carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic relationship and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development, reduced sales or other operational difficulties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND BRAND RECOGNITION\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be successful, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our source code, innovations and other intellectual property, all of which offer only limited protection. The loss of any material trade secret, trademark, tradename, patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business. Despite our precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to infringe our intellectual property rights or steal, or misappropriate, copy, disclose or reverse engineer our proprietary information, including certain portions of our solutions or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary source code. We have sought to protect our intellectual property through offensive litigation and may seek other avenues for enforcement or for return on our investment in our patent portfolio, which may be costly and unsuccessful and/or subject us to successful counterclaims or challenges to our intellectual property rights. In addition, our ability to monitor and control theft, misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property from infringement and our proprietary source code against unauthorized theft, copying, disclosure or use, we could lose market share, including as a result of unauthorized third parties\u2019 development of solutions and technologies similar to or better than ours.\nThe scope of our patent protection may be affected by changes in legal precedent and patent office interpretation of these precedents. Software-based patents are difficult to obtain and enforce in many jurisdictions and there may also be limits on recovery for damages in those jurisdictions. Further, any patents owned by us could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of protection we seek, if at all; and if issued, may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage.\nOur ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law and the enforceability of licenses. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and Canada. For example, we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our solutions under \u201cclick-to-accept\u201d license agreements that are not signed by licensees and through electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically, all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our solutions. Moreover, with respect to the various confidentiality, license or other agreements we utilize with third parties related to their use of our solutions and technologies, there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements.\nOur solutions and services, including solutions obtained through acquisitions, could infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which could result in material litigation costs.\nWe are routinely subject to patent infringement claims and may in the future be subject to an increased number of claims, including claims alleging the unauthorized use of a third-party\u2019s code in our solutions. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022the expansion of our product lines through product development and acquisitions;\n\u2022the volume of patent infringement litigation commenced by non-practicing entities;\n\u2022an increase in the number of competitors in our industry segments and the resulting increase in the number of related solutions and services and the overlap in the functionality of those solutions and services;\n\u2022an increase in the number of our competitors and third parties that use their own intellectual property rights to limit our freedom to operate and exploit our solutions, or to otherwise block us from taking full advantage of our markets;\n\u2022our reliance on the technology of others and, therefore, the requirement to obtain intellectual property licenses from third parties in order for us to commercialize our solutions or services, which licenses we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain from these third parties on reasonable terms; and\n\u2022the unauthorized or improperly licensed use of third-party code in our solutions.\nFurther, responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity or merit, could result in costly litigation. Intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022pay damages (including the potential for treble damages), license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods) to the party claiming infringement;\n\u2022cease selling solutions or services that use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022obtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022redesign the challenged technology, which could be time consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.\nIf we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively impact our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nThe solutions or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other solutions in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the Apache license (version 2), \u201cBSD-style\u201d licenses, \"MIT-style\" licenses and other open source licenses. Even though we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our solutions to conditions we do not intend, it is possible that not all instances of our open source code usage are properly reviewed. Additionally, software purchased through the supply chain may contain open source software of which we are unaware that could present license rights and/or security risk. Further, although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use such that we have not triggered any of these conditions, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation or enforcement of many of the terms of these types of licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the distribution of our solutions that contained open source software, and required to comply with the terms of the applicable license, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our solutions. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in an unintended manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to publicly release the source code of our proprietary software, offer our solutions that use the open source software for no cost, make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software, and/or license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide technology support, maintenance, warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software. Open source software may also present risks of unforeseen or unmanaged security vulnerabilities that could potentially unintentionally be introduced into our solutions.\nIf we lose access to third-party licenses, releases of our solutions could be delayed.\nWe believe that we will continue to rely, in part, on third-party licenses to enhance and differentiate our solutions. Third-party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person\u2019s code in the third party\u2019s software;\n\u2022disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable and indemnification protection;\n\u2022infringement actions brought by third-parties;\n\u2022the creation of solutions by third parties that directly compete with our solutions; and\n\u2022termination or expiration of the license.\nIf we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third-party licenses, it could delay the release of our solutions. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on maintaining and protecting the strength of our collection of brands.\nThe Citrix solution and service brands that we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Citrix solution and service brands is critical to expanding our base of customers and partners. We may be subject to reputational risks and our brand loyalty may decline if others adopt the same or confusingly similar marks in an effort to misappropriate and profit on our brand name and do not provide the same level of quality as is delivered by our solutions and services. Also, others may rely on false comparative advertising and customers or potential customers could be influenced by false advertising. Additionally, we may be unable to use some of our brands in certain countries or unable to secure trademark rights in certain jurisdictions where we do business. In order to police, maintain, enhance and protect our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may not be successful. If we fail to police, maintain, enhance and protect the Citrix brands, if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if customers or potential customers are confused by others\u2019 trademarks, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY, TAXATION AND CAPITAL RETURN\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt or repurchase our 2027 Notes or 2030 Notes upon certain events.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had aggregate indebtedness of $1.73 billion that we have incurred in connection with the issuance of our unsecured senior notes due December 1, 2027 (the \u201c2027 Notes\u201d), the issuance of our unsecured senior notes due March 1, 2030 (the \u201c2030 Notes\u201d), under the credit agreement for our unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in November 2019 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), and under the credit agreement for our term loan credit facility entered into in February 2020 (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d).\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, reducing capital expenditures, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity or debt financing on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, as applicable, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to sell assets, restructure our indebtedness or obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for information regarding our 2030 Notes, 2027 Notes, our Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, if a change in control repurchase event occurs with respect to the 2027 Notes or the 2030 Notes, we will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes or 2030 Notes, as applicable at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes or 2030 Notes, as applicable, repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In such event, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing to fund the required repurchase of the 2027 Notes or 2030 Notes, as applicable, or making such payments could adversely affect our liquidity. Our\nability to repurchase the 2027 Notes or 2030 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our other indebtedness.\nFurther, we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in the indentures governing the 2027 Notes and 2030 Notes, the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In particular, each of the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain leverage and interest ratios and contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, change our business or incur subsidiary indebtedness. The indenture governing our 2027 Notes and 2030 Notes contains covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with, or sell, assign, convey, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, taken as a whole, to, another person. If we fail to comply with these covenants or any other provision of the agreements governing our indebtedness and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Additionally, a default under an indenture, the Credit Agreement or Term Loan Credit Agreement could lead to a default under the other agreements governing our current and any future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing to repay the indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. Also, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing of our indebtedness. Downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.\nOn January 16, 2021, we obtained a commitment for a senior unsecured 364-day term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.45 billion to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of Wrike in the event that the permanent debt financing is not available on or prior to the closing of the acquisition of Wrike (the \u201cBridge Facility\u201d), which Bridge Facility is subject to customary conditions in connection with the pending acquisition of Wrike. We expect to replace the Bridge Facility prior to the closing of the acquisition of Wrike with permanent financing, which may include the issuance of debt securities and/or one or more senior term loan facilities, including the 2021 Term Loan Credit Agreement, as defined below; however such permanent financing may not be available in the timeframe expected or on favorable terms.\nOn February 5, 2021, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \u201c2021 Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides us with a facility to borrow a term loan on an unsecured basis in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.00 billion (the \u201c2021 Term Loan\u201d). The proceeds of borrowings under the 2021 Term Loan Credit Agreement will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price to be paid in connection with the acquisition of Wrike.\nTaking on additional indebtedness in connection with the Wrike acquisition, as a result of the Bridge Facility, the 2021 Term Loan Credit Agreement and/or other permanent financing, will increase the risks we now face with our current indebtedness. For example, in January 2021, we committed to a goal of maintaining our investment grade credit rating and indicated that we plan to return to historical leverage levels within 24 months. If we are unable to achieve these commitments as a result of the additional indebtedness we are expecting to incur in connection with the Wrike acquisition or otherwise, our ability to obtain additional financing or to re-finance our existing indebtedness in the future, and the terms of any such financing, could be adversely affected.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, it may also heighten these risks related to servicing our debt.\nOur portfolios of liquid securities and other investments may lose value or become impaired.\nOur investment portfolio consists of agency securities, corporate securities, money market funds, government securities and commercial paper. Although we follow an established investment policy and seek to minimize the credit risk associated with investments by investing primarily in investment grade, highly liquid securities and by limiting exposure to any one issuer depending on credit quality, we cannot give assurances that the assets in our investment portfolio will not lose value, become impaired, or suffer from illiquidity.\nChanges in our tax rates or our exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the geographic mix of our revenue, or by changes in tax laws, including changes proposed by the new Presidential administration, or their interpretation. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities, including the IRS. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance, however, that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Evolving or revised tax laws and regulations globally, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) and the 2019 Swiss Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (\u201cTRAF\u201d), as well as any changes in the application or interpretation by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Swiss federal and cantonal authorities, and other U.S. federal and legislative bodies of these regulations may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to return capital to our stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and/or the repurchase of our stock.\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the payment of cash dividends or additional share repurchase authority under our ongoing stock repurchase program as part of our capital return to stockholders. The amount and timing of cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that such cash dividends or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our applicable agreements. Our ability to pay cash dividends or repurchase stock will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, debt service, capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors that we may deem relevant. Moreover, a reduction in, or the completion of, our stock repurchase program could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends or repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.\nGENERAL RISKS\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our future operating results.\nOur results of operations are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates, which could adversely affect our future revenue and overall operating results. In order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar, we use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies as we deem appropriate for a portion of our expenses, which are denominated in the local currency of our foreign subsidiaries. We generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses for those currencies to which we have the greatest exposure. When the dollar is weak, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher, and these higher expenses will be partially offset by the gains realized from our hedging contracts. If the dollar is strong, foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower. These lower expenses will in turn be partially offset by the losses incurred from our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk and there is no guarantee that we will accurately forecast the expenses we are hedging. Further, a substantial portion of our overseas assets and liabilities are denominated in local currencies. To protect against fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in currency exchange rates when remeasuring our balance sheet, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure to this potential volatility. There is no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective. In addition, as a result of entering into these contracts with counterparties who are unrelated to us, the risk of a counterparty default exists in fulfilling the hedge contract. Should there be a counterparty default, we could be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions.\nWe are involved in litigation, investigations and regulatory inquiries and proceedings that could negatively affect us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, which may include claims with respect to commercial, product liability, intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. In the ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations. These matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations.\nRefer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a description of our legal proceedings and contingencies.\nOur stock price could be volatile, particularly during times of economic uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international stock markets, and you could lose the value of your investment.\nOur stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past. The trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future. Your investment in our stock could lose some or all of its value. Some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results, including the failure to meet key operational metrics;\n\u2022analyst reports or recommendations;\n\u2022rumors, announcements, or press articles regarding our or our competitors\u2019 operations, management, organization, financial condition, or financial statements; and\n\u2022other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market in general, The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. We believe that these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. These fluctuations may continue in the future and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of operating performance.\nChanges or modifications in financial accounting standards may have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition.\nA change or modification in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, could lead to changes in our accounting practices, and such changes could materially adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nNatural disasters, climate-related impacts, or other unanticipated catastrophes that result in a disruption of our operations could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur worldwide operations are dependent on our network infrastructure, internal technology systems and website. Significant portions of our computer equipment, intellectual property resources and personnel, including critical resources dedicated to research and development and administrative support functions are presently located at our corporate headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an area of the country that is particularly prone to hurricanes, and at our various locations in California, an area of the country that is particularly prone to earthquakes and wildfires. We also have operations in various domestic and international locations that expose us to additional diverse risks. The occurrence of natural disasters, such as extreme weather, hurricanes, floods or earthquakes; pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; or other unanticipated catastrophes, such as telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, fires or terrorist attacks, at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers and customers do business, could cause interruptions in our operations. For example, hurricanes have passed through southern Florida causing extensive damage to the region. In addition, even in the absence of direct damage to our operations, large disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other casualty events could have a significant impact on our partners\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 businesses, which in turn could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. Extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations, or our partners\u2019, suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 businesses, due to natural\ndisasters, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 82686, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "CTXS"}
