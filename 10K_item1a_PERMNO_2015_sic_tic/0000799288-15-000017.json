RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our company and our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to offer merchandise and services that customers want to purchase, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur products and services must satisfy the desires of customers, whose preferences change over time. In order to be successful, we must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous and timely basis. Failure to effectively gauge the direction of customer preferences, or convey a compelling brand image or price/value equation to customers may result in lower sales and resultant lower gross profit margins. This could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCustomer preference for our branded merchandise could change, which may adversely affect our profitability.\nSales of branded merchandise account for substantially all of our total revenues and the Lands\u2019 End brand, in particular, is a critical differentiating factor for our business. Our inability to develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, our inability to maintain our strict quality standards or to develop, produce and deliver products in a timely manner, or any unfavorable publicity with respect to the foregoing or otherwise could negatively impact the image of our brand with our customers and could result in diminished loyalty to our brand. As customer tastes change, our failure to anticipate, identify and react in a timely manner to emerging fashion trends and appropriately supply our stores, catalogs and websites with attractive high-quality products that maintain or enhance the appeal of our brand could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating margins and results of operations.\nThe success of our Direct segment depends on customers\u2019 use of our digital platform, including our e-commerce websites, and response to direct mail catalogs and digital marketing; if our overall marketing strategies, including our maintenance of a robust customer list, is not successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our Direct segment, which accounted for approximately 85% of our revenues in 2014, depends on customers\u2019 use of our e-commerce websites and their response to our direct mail catalogs and digital marketing.\nThe level of customer traffic and volume of customer purchases on our e-commerce websites is substantially dependent on our ability to provide attractive and accessible websites, a high-quality customer experience and reliable delivery of our merchandise. The success of our e-commerce websites also has historically been dependent on performance of our direct mail catalogs. If we are unable to maintain and increase customers\u2019 use of our e-commerce websites and the volume of goods they purchase, including through our failure to successfully promote and maintain our e-commerce websites and their associated services, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCustomer response to our catalogs and digital marketing is substantially dependent on merchandise assortment, merchandise availability and creative presentation, as well as the selection of customers to whom our catalogs are sent and to whom our digital marketing is directed, changes in mailing strategies and the size of our mailings. Our maintenance of a robust customer list, which we believe includes desirable demographic characteristics for the products we offer, has also been a key component of our overall strategy. If the performance of our catalogs, emails and e-commerce websites decline, or if our overall marketing strategy is not successful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information technology and a failure of information technology systems, including with respect to our e-commerce operations, or an inability to effectively upgrade or adapt our systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business, including the e-commerce websites that drive our direct-to-consumer, Lands\u2019 End Business Outfitters and international sales channels and in-store/point-of-sale systems, inventory management, warehouse management and human resources, some of which are based on end-of-life or legacy technology, operate with minimal or no vendor support and are otherwise difficult to maintain. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees or vendors. Operating legacy systems subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading and replacing these systems and recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel to maintain and operate the systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs. Our e-commerce websites are subject to numerous risks associated with selling merchandise that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer hardware and software providers, system failures and the need to invest in additional and updated computer platforms.\nOur information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, targeted or random attack or breakdown. Although we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology and also monitor our systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our information technology systems that could adversely affect our business.\nSears Holdings point of sale information technology systems are leveraged in support of our Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears, and its supply chain management information technology systems are leveraged in support of our Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears. In addition, we currently depend on Sears Holdings\u2019 information technology systems for certain key services to support our core Lands\u2019 End business channels, including tax processing and filing, and shared use of several key commercial contracts with third parties. There can be no assurance that Sears Holdings will maintain and protect these information technology systems in such a way that would prevent breakdowns or breaches in such systems, which could adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or license leading technologies useful in our business, enhance our existing services, develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development and operation of our e-commerce websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to effectively use new technologies or adapt our e-commerce websites, proprietary technologies and transaction-processing systems to meet customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to accurately project the need for such system expansion or upgrade or adapt our systems in a cost-effective and timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, whether for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur planned implementation of an enterprise resource planning software solution and other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nWe plan to implement an ERP software solution and other complementary information technology systems over the next several years. Implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The interdependence of these solutions and systems is a significant risk to the successful completion of the initiatives and the failure of any one system could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our overall information technology infrastructure. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss or corruption of data, delayed shipments, decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems, increased costs and lost revenues. In addition, transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources. Difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Implementation of this new information technology infrastructure has a significant impact on our business processes and information systems across a significant portion\nof our operations. As a result, we will be undergoing significant changes in our operational processes and internal controls as our implementation progresses, which in turn require significant change management, including recruiting and training of qualified personnel. If we are unable to successfully manage these changes as we implement these systems, including harmonizing our systems, data, processes and reporting analytics, our ability to conduct, manage and control routine business functions could be negatively affected and significant disruptions to our business could occur. In addition, we could incur material unanticipated expenses, including additional costs of implementation or costs of conducting business. These risks could result in significant business disruptions or divert management's attention from key strategic initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFluctuations and increases in the costs of raw materials could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur products are manufactured using several key raw materials, including wool, cotton and down, which are subject to fluctuations in price and availability and many of which are produced in emerging markets in Asia and Central America. The prices of these raw materials can be volatile due to the demand for fabrics, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, general economic conditions, crop yields and other unpredictable factors. Such factors may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global climate change. The prices of these raw materials may also fluctuate based on a number of other factors beyond our control, including commodity prices such as prices for oil, changes in supply and demand, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, currency exchange rates and government regulation. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for freight and distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and overall costs to purchase products from our vendors. Fluctuations in the cost, availability and quality of the raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise could have an adverse effect on our cost of goods, or our ability to meet customer demand.\nIf our relationships with our vendors are impaired, this could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and our business and results of operations.\nMost of our arrangements with the vendors that supply a significant portion of our merchandise are not long-term agreements, and, therefore, our success depends on maintaining good relations with them. Our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to efficiently supply merchandise that is consistent with our standards for quality and value. If we cannot obtain a sufficient amount and variety of quality product at acceptable prices, it could have a negative impact on our competitive position. This could result in lower revenues and decreased customer interest in our product offerings, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur arrangements with our vendors are generally not exclusive. As a result, our vendors might be able to sell similar or identical products to certain of our competitors, some of which purchase products in significantly greater volume. Our competitors may enter into arrangements with suppliers that could impair our ability to sell those suppliers\u2019 products, including by requiring suppliers to enter into exclusive arrangements, which could limit our access to such arrangements or products.\nIf we do not maintain the security of customer, employee or company information, we could experience damage to our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.\nAny significant compromise or breach of customer, employee or company data security, whether held and maintained by us or by our third-party providers, or whether intentional or inadvertent, could significantly damage our reputation and result in additional costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. We could be held liable to our customers or other parties or be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy and information security laws and regulations, and our business and reputation could be adversely affected by any resulting loss of customer confidence, litigation, civil or criminal penalties or adverse publicity.\nIf we cannot compete effectively in the apparel industry, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, men\u2019s and women\u2019s specialty apparel chains, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. Our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies, adapt to changes in customer tastes or requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing and sale of their products, or generate greater national brand recognition than us. An inability to overcome these potential competitive disadvantages or effectively market our products relative to our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Similarly, our inability to market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe success of our Retail segment depends on the performance of our Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears; if Sears Roebuck sells or disposes of its retail stores or if its retail business does not adequately promote their business or does not attract customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our Retail segment, which accounted for approximately 15% of our revenues in Fiscal 2014, depends on the success of our Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears. We operated 236 Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears as of the end of Fiscal 2014. These stores had revenues of approximately $212.0 million in Fiscal 2014, representing 90% of our Retail sales and 14% of our overall sales for Fiscal 2014. The Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears may decrease or be eliminated entirely if Sears Roebuck sells, disposes of or transfers ownership or control of any or all of its retail stores. The success and appeal of Sears stores and foot traffic within Sears stores, therefore, have a major impact on the sales of our Retail segment.\nIn addition, we depend on subsidiaries of Sears Holdings for various retail services and employees to support the Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears, including providing a dedicated, well-trained staff to directly engage with customers at the Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears, and maintaining dedicated sales areas for Lands\u2019 End branded products and shopping lounges where customers can search our offerings via the Internet and catalog. If Sears Holdings does not provide these services going forward with the standard of care and quality provided while we were a part of Sears Holdings and in accordance with our commercial agreements with Sears Holdings (or its subsidiaries) and does not deliver a rewarding shopping experience to our customers, our reputation could suffer and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the master lease agreement and master sublease agreement pursuant to which Sears Roebuck leases or subleases to us the premises for the Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears, Sears Roebuck has certain rights to (1) relocate our leased premises within the building in which such premises are located, subject to certain limitations, including our right to terminate the applicable lease if we are not satisfied with the new premises, and (2) terminate without liability the lease with respect to a particular Lands\u2019 End Shop if the overall Sears store in which such Lands\u2019 End Shop is located is closed or sold. Sears Holdings recently announced that it intends to continue to right-size, redeploy and highlight the value of its assets, including its real estate portfolio, in its transition from an asset-intensive, store-focused retailer and that it has entered into lease agreements with third party retailers for stand-alone stores. Sears Holdings also recently announced and that it expects to complete the formation of a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that would purchase and lease back 254 Sears and Kmart stores by June 1, 2015, and that it has completed the formation of real estate joint ventures with third parties. We believe that in connection with these transactions, Sears Roebuck has or intends to sell and leaseback approximately 75 Sears stores that contain a Lands' End Shop, the impact on the Company of which is not known. If Sears Roebuck continues to dispose of retail stores that contain Lands\u2019 End Shops, and/or offer us relocation alternatives for Lands\u2019 End Shops that are less attractive than the current premises, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe conduct business in and rely on sources for merchandise located in foreign markets, and our business may therefore be adversely affected by legal, regulatory, economic and political risks associated with international trade and those markets.\nSubstantially all of our merchandise is imported from vendors in China and other emerging markets in Asia and Central America, either directly by us or indirectly by distributors who, in turn, sell products to us. We also sell our products in Canada, Northern and Central Europe and Japan, and we may develop a sales presence in other\ninternational markets. Our reliance on vendors in and marketing of products to customers in foreign markets create risks inherent in doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including:\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability in the countries and regions where our customers or vendors are located;\n\u2022\nadverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with United States and other country laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery;\n\u2022\nchanges in United States and non-United States laws (or changes in the enforcement of those laws) affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, enhanced security measures at United States ports, or imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas;\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping, labor, fuel, travel and other transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special anti-dumping or countervailing duties;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions, including due to the failure of vendors or distributors to comply with import regulations; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability and acts of terrorism.\nAny increase in the cost of merchandise purchased from these vendors or restriction on the merchandise made available by these vendors could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nManufacturers in China have experienced increased costs in recent years due to shortages of labor and the fluctuation of the Chinese Yuan in relation to the United States dollar. If we are unable to successfully mitigate a significant portion of such product costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNew initiatives may be proposed in the United States that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, would increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries with which we do business. Any inability on our part to rely on our foreign sources of production due to any of the factors listed above could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect or preserve the image of our brands and our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. As such, we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our associates, consultants, vendors and others to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and we may experience difficulty in effectively limiting unauthorized use of our trademarks and other intellectual property worldwide. Unauthorized use of our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other proprietary rights may cause significant damage to our brands and our ability to effectively represent ourselves to agents, suppliers, vendors, licensees and/or customers. While we intend to enforce our trademark and other proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protected in all countries or that we will prevail when defending our trademark and proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks or other proprietary rights for any reason, or if we fail to maintain the image of our brands due to merchandise and service quality issues, actual or perceived, adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, or other reasons, our brands and reputation could be damaged and our business may be adversely affected.\nThird parties may sue us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims, and we could be forced to incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources to defend against such litigation. If the party claiming infringement were to prevail, we could be forced to discontinue the use of the related trademark or design and/or pay significant\ndamages, or to enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party, assuming these royalty or licensing arrangements are available at all on an economically feasible basis, which they may not be.\nIncreases in postage, paper and printing costs could adversely affect the costs of producing and distributing our catalog and promotional mailings, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCatalog mailings are a key aspect of our business and increases in costs relating to postage, paper and printing would increase the cost of our catalog mailings and could reduce our profitability to the extent that we are unable to offset such increases by raising prices, by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems or by using alternative direct-mail formats.\nWe currently use the national mail carriers for distribution of substantially all of our catalogs and are therefore vulnerable to postal rate increases. The current economic and legislative environments may lead to further rate increases or a discontinuation of the discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes which Lands\u2019 End currently leverages for cost savings.\nPaper for catalogs and promotional mailings is a vital resource in the success of our business. The market price for paper has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. In addition, future pricing and supply availability of catalog paper may be impacted by the continued consolidation or closings of production facilities in the United States. We do not have multi-year fixed-price contracts for the supply of paper and are not guaranteed access to, or reasonable prices for, the amounts required for the operation of our business over the long term.\nWe also depend upon external vendors to print and mail our catalogs. The limited number of printers capable of handling such needs subjects us to risks if any printer fails to perform under our agreement. Most of our catalog-related costs are incurred prior to mailing, and we are not able to adjust the costs of a particular catalog mailing to reflect the actual subsequent performance of the catalog.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with services in connection with certain aspects of our business, and any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for logistics services, information technology systems (including hosting some of our e-commerce websites), onshore and offshore software development and support, catalog production, distribution and packaging and employee benefits. Services provided by any of our third-party suppliers could be interrupted as a result of many factors, such as acts of nature or contract disputes. Any failure by a third party to provide us with contracted-for services on a timely basis or within service level expectations and performance standards could result in a disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our vendors and deliver merchandise to our customers, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the manufacture of our merchandise. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect timely and effective procurement of supplies of product from our vendors and delivery of merchandise to our customers. A majority of the products that we purchase must be shipped to our distribution centers in Dodgeville, Reedsburg and Stevens Point, Wisconsin; Oakham, United Kingdom; and Fujieda, Japan. While our reliance on a limited number of distribution centers provides certain efficiencies, it also makes us more vulnerable to natural disasters, weather-related disruptions, accidents, system failures or other unforeseen causes that could delay or impair our ability to fulfill customer orders and/or ship merchandise to our stores, which could adversely affect sales. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning, as well as business continuity planning. Our utilization of imports also makes us vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things, risks of damage, destruction or confiscation of products while in transit to a distribution center, organized labor strikes and work stoppages such as the recent labor dispute that disrupted operations at ports-of-entry on the west coast of the United States, transportation and other delays in shipments, including as a result of heightened security screening and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, unexpected or significant port congestion, lack of freight availability and freight cost increases. In addition, if we experience a shortage of a popular item, we may be required to arrange for additional quantities of the item, if available, to be delivered through airfreight, which is significantly more expensive than standard shipping by sea. We may not be able to obtain sufficient freight capacity on a timely basis or at favorable shipping rates and, therefore, may not be able to timely receive merchandise from vendors or deliver products to customers.\nWe rely upon proprietary and third-party land-based and air freight carriers for merchandise shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement weather and increased transportation costs, associated with such carriers\u2019 ability to provide delivery services to meet outbound shipping needs. In addition, if the cost of fuel rises or remains at current levels, the cost to deliver merchandise from distribution centers to customers may rise, and, although some of these costs are paid by our customers, such costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Failure to procure and deliver merchandise to customers in a timely, effective and economically viable manner could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. In addition, any increase in distribution costs and expenses could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nReliance on promotions and markdowns to encourage consumer purchases could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is dominated by large brands and national/mass retailers, where price competition, promotion, and branded product assortment drive differentiation between competitors in the industry. In order to be competitive, we must offer customers compelling products at attractive prices, including through promotions and markdowns. Heavy reliance on promotions and markdowns to encourage customers to purchase our merchandise could have a negative impact on our brand equity, gross margins and results of operations.\nIf we do not efficiently manage inventory levels, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully, but we must also avoid accumulating excess inventory, which increases working capital needs and lowers gross margins. We obtain substantially all of our inventory from vendors located outside the United States. Some of these vendors often require lengthy advance notice of order requirements in order to be able to supply products in the quantities requested. This usually requires us to order merchandise, and enter into commitments for the purchase of such merchandise, well in advance of the time these products will be offered for sale. As a result, it may be difficult to respond to changes in the apparel, footwear, accessories or home products markets. If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, inventory levels will not be appropriate and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnseasonal or severe weather conditions may adversely affect our merchandise sales.\nOur business is adversely affected by unseasonal weather conditions. Sales of certain seasonal apparel items, specifically outerwear and swimwear, are dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products. Sales of our spring and summer products, which traditionally consist of lighter clothing and swimwear, are adversely affected by cool or wet weather. Similarly, sales of our fall and winter products, which are traditionally weighted toward outerwear, are adversely affected by mild, dry or warm weather. In addition, severe weather events typically lead to temporarily reduced traffic at the Sears locations in which Lands\u2019 Ends Shops at Sears are located and at our other retail locations which could lead to reduced sales of our merchandise. Severe weather events may impact our ability to supply our stores, deliver orders to customers on schedule and staff our stores and fulfillment centers, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, and any decrease in our sales or margins could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of sales occurring during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Our sales and margins during the fourth quarter may fluctuate based upon factors such as the timing of holiday seasons and promotions, the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing and level of markdowns, competitive factors, weather and general economic conditions. Any decrease in sales or margins, whether as a result of increased promotional activity or because of economic conditions, poor weather or other factors, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We generally carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the fourth quarter peak selling periods. If we are not successful in selling inventory during these periods, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our independent vendors do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable regulations and laws, our reputation could be materially harmed and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur reputation and customers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our vendors\u2019 compliance with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their business. While we operate compliance and monitoring programs to promote ethical and lawful business practices, we do not exercise ultimate control over our independent vendors or their business practices and cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical and lawful business practices. Violation of labor or other laws by vendors, or the divergence of a vendor\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States could materially hurt our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to assessments for additional state taxes, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn accordance with current law, we pay, collect and/or remit taxes in those states where we or our subsidiaries, as applicable, maintain a physical presence. While we believe that we have appropriately remitted all taxes based on\nour interpretation of applicable law, tax laws are complex and their application differs from state to state. It is possible that some taxing jurisdictions may attempt to assess additional taxes and penalties on us or assert either an error in our calculation, a change in the application of law, or an interpretation of the law that differs from our own, which may, if successful, adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, including with respect to product liability claims. These proceedings may be affected by changes in laws and government regulations or changes in their enforcement.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business or products we sell or have sold. These proceedings may be in jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws, including wage and hour laws, privacy laws, and laws relating to electronic commerce. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, any such proceeding could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial resources to defend the proceeding, which could affect the future premiums we would be required to pay on our insurance policies. Changes in governmental regulations could also have adverse effects on our business and subject us to additional regulatory actions.\nSome of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage allegedly caused by these products, and could require us to take corrective actions, including product recalls. Although we maintain liability insurance, there is no guarantee that our current or future coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature, as well as product recalls, could also have an adverse effect on customer confidence in the products we sell and on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe could incur charges due to impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets.\nAs of January 30, 2015, we had goodwill and intangible asset balances totaling $638.7 million, most of which are subject to testing for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our intangible assets consist of $528.3 million for our trade name, $0.4 million of finite-lived customer lists and a goodwill balance of $110.0 million. Any event that impacts our reputation could result in impairment charges for our trade name. Long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, are also subject to testing for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in our impairment assessment. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating revenue growth, future cash flows and asset fair values, we could incur impairment charges for intangible assets, goodwill or long-lived assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur failure to retain our executive management team and to attract qualified new personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the talents and continued efforts of our executive management team. The loss of members of our executive management may disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to manage further expansion will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. We believe that having personnel who are passionate about our brand and have industry experience and a strong customer service ethic has been an important factor in our historical success, and we believe that it will continue to be important to growing our business. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably. With the seasonal nature of the retail business, over 2,000 flexible part-time employees join us each year to support our varying peak seasons, including the fourth quarter holiday shopping season. An inability to attract qualified seasonal personnel could interrupt our sales during this period.\nOur international expansion may not be successful.\nOur future strategies may include international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels and brands, including in Asia and Europe. We have limited experience operating in many of these locations, and face major, established competitors and barriers to entry. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely affect our international operations and sales, including by increasing the cost of business in certain locations. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations from those in our existing locations, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or profitable. If international expansion is not successful or does not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is affected by worldwide economic and market conditions; a failure of the economy to sustain its recovery, a renewed decline in consumer-spending levels and other adverse developments, including rising inflation, could lead to reduced revenues and gross margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nMany economic and other factors are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, consumer and commercial credit availability, inflation, unemployment, consumer debt levels and other challenges currently affecting the global economy. Increases in the rates of unemployment, decreases in home values, reduced access to credit and issues related to the domestic and international political situations may adversely affect consumer confidence and disposable income levels. Low consumer confidence and disposable incomes could lead to reduced consumer spending and lower demand for our products, which are discretionary items, the purchase of which can be reduced before customers adjust their budgets for necessities. These factors could have a negative impact on our sales and cause us to increase inventory markdowns and promotional expenses, thereby reducing our gross margins and operating results.\nIn addition, our liquidity needs are funded by operating cash flows and, to the extent necessary, may be funded by borrowings under our ABL Facility. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d The ability to raise additional financing depends on numerous factors that are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, the health of financial institutions, our credit ratings and lenders\u2019 assessments of our prospects and the prospects of the retail industry in general. The lenders under any credit facilities or loan agreements we may enter into may not be able to meet their commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. There can be no assurance that our ability to otherwise access the credit markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. If we are not able to fulfill our liquidity needs through operating cash flows and/or borrowings under credit facilities or otherwise in the capital markets, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOther factors may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany other factors may affect our profitability and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards and environmental laws;\n\u2022\ndifferences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n\u2022\nchanges in the rate of inflation, interest rates and the performance of investments held by us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to us; and\n\u2022\nchanges in business, economic and political conditions, including war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups.\nAdditional Risks Related to Our Separation from, and Relationship with, Sears Holdings\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nAlthough we were an independent company prior to our acquisition by Sears Roebuck in June 2002, the information about us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K prior to the Separation date of April 4, 2014 refers to the Lands\u2019 End\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with Sears Holdings. Accordingly, such historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, Sears Holdings or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us. Following the Separation, Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries provides some of these functions to us. Our historical financial results prior to the Separation reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Sears Holdings for these functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. Following the Separation, we may not be able to perform these functions as efficiently or at comparable costs;\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, we were able to use Sears Holdings\u2019 size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and have shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we entered into a transition services agreement and other commercial agreements with Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Sears Holdings and may result in us paying higher charges than in the past for these services. As a separate, publicly traded company, we may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the Separation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations;\n\u2022\nGenerally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Sears Holdings. As an independent company, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements; and\n\u2022\nOur financial information for periods prior to the Separation does not reflect the debt we incurred in connection with the Separation.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Sears Holdings and the related expiration of agreements with Sears Holdings and from the termination of our rights to operate under third party agreements that were executed when we were a subsidiary of Sears Holdings. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined financial statements of our business, see \u201cItem 6. Selected Historical Financial Data,\u201d \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the historical combined financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSears Holdings or its subsidiaries may fail to perform under various agreements with us or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\nWe rely on Sears Holdings to provide logistics, point-of-sale and related store systems to the Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears. In connection with the Separation, we entered into various agreements, including a buying agency agreement, separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement and a tax sharing agreement, to effect the Separation and provide a framework for our relationship with Sears Holdings after the Separation. In addition, we entered into commercial agreements with Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries, including a master lease agreement, a master sublease agreement, a financial services agreement, a retail operations agreement for the Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears and a Shop Your Way Rewards retail establishment agreement. We rely on Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Sears Holdings or its\nsubsidiaries are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, including their indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. These arrangements could lead to disputes between Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries and us over the use of and charges for facilities and the allocation of revenues and expenses for our sales from the Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears.\nIf we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transaction or commercial agreements terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries currently provide to us. We may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from Sears Holdings\u2019 systems to ours. These systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries are expected to provide during the transition period.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms of our agreements with Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nOur agreements with Sears Holdings or its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, including the buying agency agreement, transition services agreement, tax sharing agreement, master lease agreement, master sublease agreement, financial services agreement, Lands\u2019 End Shops at Sears retail operations agreement and Shop Your Way Rewards retail establishment agreement, were prepared in the context of the Separation while we were still a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sears Holdings. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of these agreements and amendments were prepared, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of Sears Holdings. As a result, the terms of these agreements are of fixed duration and may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Sears Holdings and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as with a buyer in a sale of a business, may have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Sears Holdings pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could adversely affect us.\nThe separation and distribution agreement with Sears Holdings provides, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Separation, certain conditions to the Separation and provisions governing the relationship between us and Sears Holdings with respect to and resulting from the Separation. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation, as well as any obligations of Sears Holdings that we may assume pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. If we are required to indemnify Sears Holdings under the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nWe might not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Sears Holdings of the Separation, under the tax sharing agreement that we entered into with Sears Holdings, we agreed to refrain from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Separation and related transactions from being tax-free. Further, for the two-year period following the Distribution, in certain circumstances we agreed to restrictions with respect to the following transactions:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 40% or more of our stock or 60% or more of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing capital stock beyond certain thresholds; and\n\u2022\nceasing to be engaged in our pre-Separation business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Furthermore, we could be liable for any resulting tax if our actions are deemed to be in violation of the tax sharing agreement.\nESL, whose interests may be different from the interests of other stockholders, may be able to exert substantial influence over our company.\nAccording to a Schedule 13D filed on April 8, 2014 with the SEC, ESL beneficially owned on the filing date 48.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, ESL could have substantial influence over many, if not all, actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders, and will have a significant voice in the election of directors and any transactions involving a change of control. The interests of ESL, which has investments in other companies (including Sears Holdings), may from time to time diverge from the interests of our other stockholders. Mr. Lampert is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Sears Holdings.\nPotential liabilities may arise under fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws and legal capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn the event that any entity involved in the Separation (including certain internal restructuring and financing transactions contemplated to be consummated in connection with the Separation) subsequently fails to pay its creditors or enters insolvency proceedings, these transactions may be challenged under United States federal, United States state and foreign fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws, as well as legal capital requirements governing distributions and similar transactions. If a court were to determine under these laws that, (a) at the time of the Separation, the entity in question: (1) was insolvent; (2) was rendered insolvent by reason of the Separation; (3) had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital; (4) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured; or (b) the transaction in question failed to satisfy applicable legal capital requirements, the court could determine that the Separation was voidable, in whole or in part. Subject to various defenses, the court could then require Sears Holdings or us, or other recipients of value in connection with the Separation (potentially including our stockholders as recipients of shares of our common stock in connection with the Separation), as the case may be, to turn over value to other entities involved in the Separation and related transactions for the benefit of unpaid creditors. The measure of insolvency and applicable legal capital requirements will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry. The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe have significant debt service obligations. Our debt and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. Our level of debt presents the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\nwe could be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal (including amortization) and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate requirements or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if prevailing interest rates increase, because a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nour substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nour debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, our industry and changing market conditions and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;\n\u2022\nour level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nthe agreements governing our debt contain covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022\nthe agreements governing our debt contain operating covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best interests in the long term, including, without limitation, by restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur debt, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates or prepay certain kinds of indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nthe failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that debt.\nWe may need additional financing in the future for our general corporate purposes or growth strategies, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes or growth strategies. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance our products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may decline if ESL decides to sell a portion of its holdings of our common stock.\nESL will, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and terms of any transactions with respect to its shares common stock of the Company, taking into account business and market conditions and other factors that it deems relevant. ESL is not subject to any contractual obligation to maintain its ownership position in us, although it may be subject to certain transfer restrictions imposed by securities law. Consequently, we cannot assure you that ESL will maintain its ownership interest in us. Any sale by ESL of our common stock or any announcement by ESL that it has decided to sell shares of our common stock, or the perception by the investment community that ESL has sold or decided to sell shares of our common stock, could have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Any payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors then existing, including earnings, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, any contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, restrictions imposed by applicable law, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our capital stock in the form of dividends.\nOur share price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions.\nFurther, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often initiate securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against Lands\u2019 End could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our senior management and other resources.\nYour percentage ownership in Lands\u2019 End may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in Lands\u2019 End may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, strategic investments, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors may grant additional stock-based awards to our employees, which would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, and which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we may issue additional stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nBeing a public company subjects us to expenses and administrative burdens, in particular compliance with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAs a public company, we incur certain legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not otherwise incur. These costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), tax administration, and legal and human-resources related functions. We are required to, among other things, maintain the roles and duties of board committees, maintain additional internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, and maintain an insider trading policy in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.\nBeing a public company subjects us to additional laws, rules and regulations that require the investment of resources to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. In addition, these laws, rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, and in particular to serve on our Audit Committee.", "PERMNO": 14544, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "LE"}
