You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted and disrupted our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business and we expect it could continue to do so.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a material adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world, including in all of the markets that we serve. We have implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business, but there can be no assurance that these measures will succeed. We cannot predict the degree to which, or the time period over which, our sales and operations will be affected by this outbreak. The effects could be material. The COVID-19 pandemic poses many risks including the following, among others:\n\u2022\nOur employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\n\u2022\nDue to social distancing protocols and higher than normal employee absenteeism caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the capacity output of our manufacturing facilities has decreased when compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. Lower capacity utilization of our facilities could continue to persist until the effects of the pandemic subside.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions and delays in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in higher supply chain costs to us, in order to maintain the supply of component parts needed to produce our products.\n\u2022\nOur management of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has required, and will continue to require, significant investment of time by our management and employees. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward other initiatives or investments, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior including uncertainty in consumer confidence, increasing unemployment, and reductions in discretionary spending related to pandemic fears as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include widespread unemployment and uncertainty, among other problems, reducing the likelihood of people seeking new or improved housing.\n\u2022\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. We rely on the credit markets to provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital were to increase significantly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business, could be materially adversely affected.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19, the availability and efficacy of vaccines and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of significantly heightening other risks associated with our business and our financial condition, including several of the risks disclosed below.\nMarket, Industry and Supply Chain Risks\nRaw material shortages and price increases could delay or increase the cost of construction of our products which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our cash flows.\nCertain materials used in the construction of homes such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, among others, can become scarce during periods of high demand for new home construction as well as renovation and remodeling of existing homes. We depend on timely and sufficient delivery of raw materials from our suppliers. In addition, a few key components of our products are produced by a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Disruption to the supply chain of these key components could have an adverse impact on our production output. Raw material shortages from these and\nother suppliers can be more severe during periods following natural disasters or broader economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, during fiscal 2021, we saw a significant increase in the cost, and decrease in the availability, of forest products as a result of increased demand and shutdowns of lumber mills due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is uncertain whether these shortages will continue as is, improve or worsen.\nPricing for raw materials can also be affected by the factors mentioned above as well as national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including tariffs. As a result, we may continue to see raw material cost pressures in future periods as strong housing demand continues. We may attempt to pass the higher material costs onto customers, but it is not certain that we will be able to achieve this without adversely affecting demand. Raw material shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increases to our costs of construction which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions.\nThe factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, our sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future.\nThe factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemics, employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels, and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by us or constraints on the prices we can charge, could result in a decrease in our net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Changes in demand could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDemand for our homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; there might be significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins could decline significantly from historical levels; and we might incur losses from operations. We cannot predict the future demand for housing. If it were to decline significantly, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRapid or significantly increasing demand can also adversely affect our business. Longer periods of time between order acceptance and production introduce a risk that we may not be able to construct homes profitably if material and labor costs increase. Although we have generally been able to pass along price increases to our customers in periods of rising costs, we may not be able to in the future, or the price increases may cause consumers to explore other housing alternatives and/or exit the home buying process, negatively impacting demand for our homes.\nFactory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, then our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment and face competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of our manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors\u2019 products in most areas where our homes are sold and in most areas where we have Company-owned retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, we believe that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter our markets. In addition, our products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. We also compete with resale homes, also referred to as \u201cpreviously owned\u201d or \u201cexisting\u201d homes, as well as rental housing.\nAn oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on us: sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by our home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of\nthe homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, then our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors. As a result, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nChanges in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales.\nWe cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for our products in particular, will remain unchanged. Our ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of our operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our net sales may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors\u2019 products may obtain better market acceptance despite our efforts to lead the market.\nIncreases in the after-tax costs of owning a factory-built home could deter potential customers from buying our products and adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nSignificant expenses of owning a factory-built home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally were, under prior tax law, deductible expenses for an individual\u2019s federal income taxes and, in some cases, state income taxes, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), included provisions that impose limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in home insurance premiums, also can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and in turn can have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas.\nOur operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, then our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.\nIncreased attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price.\nRecently, more attention has been directed to publicly traded companies and their activities related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters. Advocacy groups have campaigned for action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters. These activities include increasing action related to climate change and the use of energy efficient building products. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns could cause harm to our business and reputation. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and other matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment which could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nRegulatory Risks\nEnvironmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and energy can have an adverse impact on our business, our results of operations and on the availability and price of certain raw materials.\nGovernment regulations proposed or enacted in response to climate change could result in increased costs of raw materials and other production costs of our homes. We believe that a variety of new legislation may be considered at the federal, state and local levels relating to climate change and energy efficiency. This legislation could result in changes to the HUD-code and other building standards requiring more robust energy efficiency standards or require the use of energy-saving construction material in our products. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our costs. Compliance\nwith these new standards may also cause an increase in our costs and use of human capital resources. As climate change and energy efficiency remains a global focus, energy-related initiatives will impact many companies including our suppliers of many of our raw materials such as lumber and steel. The initiatives undertaken by our suppliers could adversely impact our results of operations to the extent our suppliers raise their prices to cover energy and climate related initiatives. New environmental laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nLimitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, our sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, then our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting our operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and we cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on us or on the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, \u201crestart\u201d rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost inflation.\nThe homebuilding industry has from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. These labor shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing, during periods following natural disasters or as a result of broader economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and our subcontractors in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. These factors can also impact the cost of labor. We have historically experienced high turnover rates among our direct labor employees, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.\nComplications with the implementation of our new enterprise-wide system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize and report our operating results. In fiscal 2022, we will begin a multi-year replacement of our current information systems with a suite of cloud-based functionality. With the new system, we expect to improve decision-making capabilities through real-time data and analytics, simplify and standardize business processes, reduce manual effort, improve value-added activities, and improve transparency and accountability all while enhancing the customer experience making our company easier to do business with. The system selection and implementation process has required, and will continue to require, a significant investment of personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the new system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully implement the system as planned, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the system as planned or it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed.\nIf we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nAlthough we maintain our own factory direct retail business in select markets, we conduct a majority of our business through independent distributors. Over 90% of our shipments of homes in fiscal 2021 were made to independent distributors throughout the U.S. and western Canada. We may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes. Even if we establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors\u2019 homes instead. The independent distributors with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic, and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets we serve, sales in those markets, if we cannot offset by sales through an expanded factory-direct retail business, could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nWhen we introduce new products into the marketplace, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings.\nThe introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to our future success, but we may incur unexpected expenses when we make such introductions. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense, which could have adverse impacts on our earnings.\nOur products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and can harm our reputation.\nOur products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. There is no assurance that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, there is no assurance that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the financial ability to rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm our reputation.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we cannot retain current management team members or if we are unable to attract and motivate key personnel.\nOur success depends upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, many of whom have been with us for a significant number of years. Changes in our senior management team or other key employees may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of our business, and our business might be harmed as a result. Our business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures.\nWe may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. Inability to do so would result in constraints that would significantly impede the achievement of our objectives. We may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a home builder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are unable to obtain adequate or reasonably-priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, then we may experience losses that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our results of operations.\nData security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. We also have outsourced elements of our information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, particularly with employees and others on data networks working increasingly from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other such factors. We, our partners, vendors, and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our and their information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nEngaging in mergers and acquisitions, such as the acquisition of ScotBilt Homes, involve risks that could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we recently acquired ScotBilt Homes and may choose to engage in discussions and negotiations regarding additional mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations. The purchase price for possible acquisitions of businesses and assets might be paid from cash, borrowings, or through the issuance of common stock or other securities, or a combination of these methods. Business combinations entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of acquired operations and products, which can impact the retention of customer accounts;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve expected synergies, implement appropriate internal controls or integrate information systems;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nassumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, which could become material or subject us to litigation or regulatory risks;\n\u2022\namortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of customers or key employees.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate business combinations, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. Also, business combinations are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change. Therefore, if and when we enter into a business combination agreement, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, then our stock price could decline.\nNevertheless, opportunities arise from time to time that we choose to evaluate. Any transactions that we pursue and consummate would involve these risks and uncertainties, as well as others. The risks of a business combination could result in the failure of the anticipated benefits of that particular combination to be realized, which in turn could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk.\nOur management team is responsible for managing risk, subject to oversight by our board of directors. Our risk management methods may not identify all future risk exposures and may not be completely effective in mitigating all key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across the Company or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods may be based on assumptions that will prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage risk effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nFuture increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of our potential customers and could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nA large portion of the people who buy our homes finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. Interest rates have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. In addition, recent increases in the prices of homes may limit consumers\u2019 ability to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe liquidity provided by the GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and our sales of new homes.\nThe availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits.\nFactory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of our independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, we could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and its operating results and cash flows could suffer.\nWe have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers.\nAs is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with the floor plan financing programs, we generally have separate agreements with the financing companies that require us to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. The impact of COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on the solvency of independent industry retailers, and as a result, we may be required to honor the contingent repurchase agreements if the retailers default under terms of the floor plan financing arrangements. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. Our contingent repurchase obligation as of April 3, 2021, was estimated to be approximately $219.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements.\nIndustry conditions and future operating results could limit our sources of capital. If we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nWe depend on our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and our revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) to finance our operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available, then we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions, or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses.\nWe have substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in these businesses.\nAn impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth.\nAs of April 3, 2021, 20.9% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe replacement or modification of LIBOR as a reference rate could increase our interest expense in the future.\nThe London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. LIBOR is currently used as the reference rate on our credit facility, which matures on June 5, 2023. Currently, no replacement rate has been identified. The transition from LIBOR could result in higher interest expense than has historically been recognized.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud.\nWe anticipate paying no cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be investors\u2019 only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.", "PERMNO": 38850, "SIC": 2451, "TIC": "SKY"}
