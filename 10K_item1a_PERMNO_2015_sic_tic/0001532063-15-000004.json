{"cik": "1532063", "company": "Express Scripts Holding Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe operate in a very competitive industry, which could compress our margins and impair our ability to attract and retain clients. Our failure to effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors could magnify the impact of the competitive environment.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer demands, legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors. We must remain competitive in order to attract new clients and retain and cross-sell additional products and services to our existing clients. Strong competition in the PBM marketplace has generated greater client demand for lower pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. These competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many PBMs, including us, to reduce the prices charged for core products and services while sharing a greater portion of the formulary fees and related revenues received from pharmaceutical manufacturers with clients. We cannot assume positive trends such as lower drug purchasing costs, increased generic usage, drug price inflation, increased rebates, favorable demographics and specialty growth would offset these pressures in the future. Our inability to maintain these positive trends, or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services, which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between us and our competitors as our client contracts are generally three years. Many clients work through knowledgeable consultants and our larger clients typically seek competing bids from our competitors prior to contract expiration. These factors together with the impact of competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to attract new clients, retain existing clients and cross-sell additional services, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTo succeed in the highly competitive PBM marketplace, it is imperative we maintain a strong reputation as well as differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that demonstrate enhanced value to our clients, particularly in response to market changes from public policy. The negative reputational impact of a significant event, including a failure to execute on client contracts or to successfully operate the complex structure of our business or otherwise innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our clients, could therefore affect our ability to grow and retain profitable clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe delivery of healthcare-related products and services is an evolving and rapidly changing industry. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes or trends within the industry could have a negative impact on our ability to compete and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have designed our business model to compete within the current industry structure. Our client contracts are generally three years and our pharmaceutical manufacturer and retail contracts are typically non-exclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party. Any significant shifts in the structure of the PBM industry or the healthcare products and services industry in general could alter the industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients. Such industry shifts could result from, among other things: a large intra- or inter-industry merger, strategic alliances, a new entrant (including the government), a new or alternative business model, a general decrease in drug utilization, changes in the United States Postal Service or the consolidation of shipping carriers, an increased ability of consultants to influence the market, increased drug acquisition cost, changes in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market, rapid technological shifts or the necessary changes or unintended consequences of the federal Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Reform Laws. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the managed care industry has undergone periods of substantial consolidation and may continue to consolidate in the future. If one or more of our managed care clients is acquired, and the acquiring entity is not a client, then we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business. If such acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are material, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Changes in or failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, or the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, could require us to make significant changes to our business operations or result in the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, we may be required to spend significant resources in order to comply with new, changing or existing laws, rules and regulations.\nNumerous state and federal laws, rules and regulations affect our business and operations and include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nhealthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which prohibit certain types of payments and referrals as well as false claims made in connection with health benefit programs\n\u2022\nERISA and related regulations, which regulate many aspects of healthcare plan arrangements\n\u2022\nstate legislation regulating PBMs or imposing fiduciary status on PBMs\n\u2022\nconsumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations\n\u2022\nnetwork pharmacy access laws, including \u201cany willing provider\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d legislation, that affect aspects of our pharmacy network contracts\n\u2022\nwholesale distributor laws\n\u2022\nlegislation imposing benefit plan design restrictions and requirements, which limit how our clients can design their drug benefit plans\n\u2022\nvarious licensure laws, such as managed care and third-party administrator licensure laws\n\u2022\ndrug pricing legislation, including \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing\n\u2022\npharmacy laws and regulations, including delivery channels\n\u2022\nstate insurance regulations applicable to our insurance subsidiaries\n\u2022\ninformation privacy and security laws and regulations, including those under the HIPAA omnibus rule\n\u2022\nMedicare prescription drug program participation requirements including coverage standards and beneficiary protections\n\u2022\nother Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement regulations, including subrogation\n\u2022\nthe Health Reform Laws, including regulations applicable to clients operating qualified health plans through the state and federal marketplace (\u201cHealth Insurance Exchange\u201d)\n\u2022\nfederal laws related to our Department of Defense arrangement\n\u2022\nfederal antitrust laws related to our pharmacy, pharmaceutical manufacturer and client relationships\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n\u2022\ninternational laws\nThese and other regulatory matters are described in more detail under \u201cPart I - Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation and Compliance\u201d above.\nWe believe we operate our business in substantial compliance with all existing material legal requirements applicable to us. However, significant uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. From time to time, state and federal law enforcement agencies and regulatory agencies have initiated investigations or litigation involving certain aspects of our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses and, consequently, we cannot provide any assurance that one or more of these agencies will not interpret or apply these legal requirements in a manner adverse to our business, or, if there is an enforcement action brought against us, that our interpretation would prevail. In addition, there are numerous proposed healthcare laws, rules and regulations at the federal and state levels, many of which could materially affect aspects of our business or adversely affect our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives relating to our business or the healthcare industry in general will be enacted in the future or what effect, if any, such legislation or regulations may have on us. Due to these uncertainties, we may be required to spend\nsignificant resources in connection with any such investigation or litigation or to comply with new or existing laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, including those related to financial disclosure, are complex and require significant resources to remain compliant. Any substantial non-compliance with such legal and regulatory requirements could result in significant fines and penalties or a restatement of our financial statements, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nVarious governmental agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain PBM business practices. Many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such governmental investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the PBM industry in general (see \u201cPart I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d). However, we may experience additional government scrutiny and audit activity related to audits that Accredo Health Group face or may face which result in payment or offset of prior reimbursement from the government.\nSeveral states are considering but have not yet enacted statutes that would purport to declare a PBM is a fiduciary with respect to its clients and one such statue has been overturned in the District of Columbia. We cannot predict what effect, if any, these and similar statutes, if enacted, may have on our business and financial results, nor can we predict how other courts may view such laws.\nChanges to government policies, including policies designed to manage healthcare costs or other healthcare financing practices could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, certain legislative and/or regulatory proposals are made which seek to manage the healthcare industry, including managing prescription drug cost, regulating drug distribution and managing health records. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, \u201csingle-payer\u201d government funded healthcare, changes in reimbursement rates, restrictions on access or therapeutic substitution, limits on more efficient delivery channels, taxes on goods and services, price controls on prescription drugs, incentivizing the use of electronic health records, regulating the use of maximum allowable cost pricing and other significant healthcare reform proposals. In addition, changes to government policies not specifically targeted to the healthcare industry, such as an increase in the corporate tax rate or government spending cuts, could have significant impacts on the PBM marketplace. We are unable to predict whether any such policies or proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof. Certain of these policies or proposals could, if enacted, adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe implementation of the Health Reform Laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the federal government enacted the Health Reform Laws, which will be gradually phased in through 2020 (see \u201cPart I - Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation and Compliance - Federal Healthcare Reform\u201d). The Health Reform Laws contain many provisions that directly or indirectly apply to us, our clients, employers and benefit providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare providers and others with whom we do business, including:\n\u2022\nPBM disclosure requirements in the context of Medicare Part D and the Health Insurance Exchanges\n\u2022\nnew federal regulations applicable to health plans offered by insurance companies, employers and other plan sponsors\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulations applicable to health plans offered in the Health Insurance Exchanges\n\u2022\nmedical loss ratio requirements, which require insurers to spend a specified percentage of premium revenues on incurred claims or healthcare quality improvements, and require some of our clients to report certain types of PBM proprietary information\n\u2022\nvarious health insurance taxes and fees\n\u2022\nchanges to the calculation of average manufacturer price (\u201cAMP\u201d) of drugs and an increase in the rebate amounts drug manufacturers must pay to states for drugs reimbursed by state Medicaid programs, including through Medicaid managed care organizations\n\u2022\nimposition of new fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers of brand-name prescription drugs\n\u2022\nexpansion of the 340B drug discount program, which limits the costs of certain outpatient drugs to qualified health centers and hospitals\n\u2022\nrisk adjustments, risk corridors and reinsurance requirements that affect certain of our clients\n\u2022\nclosing of the so-called donut hole under Medicare Part D by lowering beneficiary coinsurance amounts\n\u2022\nelimination of the tax deduction for employers who receive Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy payments\n\u2022\nmandated changes to client plan designs\n\u2022\nchanges to certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws\nThe scope and ultimate effect of such provisions on our business remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact any interim or final implementation will have on our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with general economic conditions.\nThe state of the economy can have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. An unfavorable or uncertain economic environment could significantly and adversely affect our businesses and profitability and generate the following risks to our business:\n\u2022\nclients, employers and other benefit providers served by our clients may reduce or slow the growth of their workforce or covered membership, or may elect to discontinue or diminish provided benefits, which would result in a reduction in the number of members we serve\n\u2022\nconsumers may be less willing or able to incur health care related expenses, whether due to personal economic circumstances, reduction in the level of the health care benefit provided to the consumer or otherwise, which would result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services\n\u2022\nour clients, or potential clients, may increase demands and expectations with respect to pricing, rebates or service levels (including with respect to performance guarantees), which could impact margins, or our ability to obtain new clients or retain existing clients\n\u2022\nour clients, or potential clients, may be less willing to purchase additional products and services from us, which would impact our financial performance\nUnfavorable and uncertain economic conditions may also cause disruptions in the credit markets which could increase our cost of borrowing or make credit unavailable on acceptable terms to the extent we need additional funds. Such developments may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to conduct operations depends on the security and stability of our technology infrastructure as well as the effectiveness of, and our ability to execute, business continuity plans across our operations. A failure in the security of our technology infrastructure or a significant disruption in service within our operations could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe maintain, and are dependent on, a technology infrastructure platform essential for many aspects of our business operations. We have many different information systems and it is imperative we securely store and transmit confidential data, including personal health information, while maintaining the integrity of our confidential information. Any failure to protect against a security breach or a disruption in service could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely impact our business operations and results of operations. Our technology infrastructure platform requires significant resources to maintain and enhance systems in order to keep pace with rapid technological change as well as evolving industry and regulatory standards. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. From time to time, we may obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties\u2019 failure to adequately perform or protect against a security breach or service disruption. In the event we or our vendors experience:\n\u2022\na malfunction in business processes\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches (including cyber attacks)\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain effective and up-to-date information systems or\n\u2022\notherwise experience unauthorized or non-compliant actions by any individual\nWe could incur disruptions to our business operations or negative impacts to patient safety, customer and member disputes, damage to our reputation, exposures to risk of loss, litigation or regulatory violations, increased administrative expenses or other adverse consequences.\nWe operate dispensing pharmacies, call centers, data centers and corporate facilities that depend on the security and stability of our technology infrastructure. Our technology infrastructure could be disrupted by any number of events including a general failure of the technology, malfunction of business process or a disaster or other catastrophic event. Such disruptions could, temporarily or indefinitely, significantly reduce, or partially or totally eliminate our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients and members. Any such service disruption at these facilities or to\nthis infrastructure or our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA significant disruption in service within our operations could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on a number of different operations, products and processes, many of which involve third parties. A disruption in our business operations could result from, among other things, contamination of drugs or a failure to maintain appropriate shipment and storage conditions (such as temperature), an error in mail order processing, the unavailability of services provided by our suppliers, vendors or shipping carriers, labor strikes, or unanticipated disruptions at our mail order facilities, call centers, data centers or corporate facilities. Such disruptions or our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could, temporarily or indefinitely, significantly reduce, or partially or totally eliminate our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients and members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our business is concentrated in certain significant client contracts. Our failure to execute on or other issues arising under, such contracts or conditions or trends impacting certain of our key clients could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs described in greater detail in the description of our business in Item 1 above (see \u201cPart I - Item 1 - Business - Clients\u201d), we have long-term contracts with Anthem (formerly known as WellPoint) and the United States Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d). These two clients, collectively represented 25.9% and 22.4% of our revenue during 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIf one or more of our large clients either terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified, renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us, our financial results could be materially adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in stock price declines or other adverse effects.\nIf we are not able to replace lost business or margin by generating new sales with comparable operating margins or successfully executing other corporate strategies, our revenues and results of operations could suffer. In addition, if certain of our key clients are negatively impacted by business conditions or other economic trends, or if such clients are acquired, consolidated or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers, our business and financial results could be impaired.\nMore than 69,000 retail pharmacies, which represent over 95% of all United States retail pharmacies, participated in one or more of our networks at December 31, 2014. The ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 60% of the total number of stores in our largest network. In certain geographic areas of the United States, our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains. Contracts with retail pharmacies are generally non-exclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party. If one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us, or is able to renegotiate terms that are substantially less favorable to us, our members\u2019 access to retail pharmacies and/or our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the entry of one or more large pharmacy chains into the PBM business in addition to the current pharmacy chain competitors, the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers, could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies. Changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could have a negative impact on our claims volume and/or our competitiveness in the marketplace, which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations.\nRegulatory changes relating to Medicare Part D, our failure to comply with CMS regulatory requirements, our failure to comply with CMS contractual requirements applicable to us as a Medicare Part D PDP sponsor or our failure to otherwise execute on our strategies related to Medicare Part D, could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have been approved to function as a Medicare Part D sponsor for the purpose of making Medicare Part D EGWP plans available for eligible clients and certain of our subsidiaries have been approved by CMS to participate in the Medicare Part D program as national Medicare Part D PDP sponsors that provide direct services to Medicare Part D eligible members. As Medicare Part D PDP and EGWP sponsors, certain subsidiaries are required to comply with federal Medicare Part D laws and regulations and are also required to be licensed as insurers or may otherwise be subject to aspects of state laws regulating the business of insurance.\nWe also provide other products and services in support of our clients\u2019 Medicare Part D plans or federal Retiree Drug Subsidy plans. We have made, and may be required to make further, substantial investments in the personnel and technology necessary to administer our Medicare Part D strategy and operations. There are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program, and we can give no assurance these risks will not materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. The receipt of federal funds made available through the Medicare Part D program by us, our affiliates or clients is subject to compliance with the Medicare regulations and established laws and regulations governing the federal government\u2019s payment for healthcare goods and services, including the anti-kickback laws and the federal False Claims Act. If material contractual or regulatory non-compliance was to be identified, including, for example, during CMS audits or client audits in cases where we provide PBM services to client PDP sponsors, recoupment, monetary penalties and/or applicable sanctions, including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in Medicare programs, could be imposed. Further, the adoption or promulgation of new or more complex regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing regulatory requirements, in each case, associated with Medicare may require us to incur significant compliance-related costs which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.\nIn addition, due to the availability of Medicare Part D, some of our employer clients may stop providing pharmacy benefit coverage to retirees, instead allowing retirees to choose their own Medicare Part D plans, which could cause a reduction in utilization for our services. Extensive competition among Medicare Part D plans could also result in the loss of Medicare members by our managed care customers, which would cause a decline in our membership base. Further, certain of our Medicare Part D product offerings require premium payment from members for the ongoing benefit, as well as amounts due from CMS, and as a result of the demographics of the calculations, as well as the potential magnitude and timing of settlement for amounts due from CMS, these accounts receivable are subject to billing and realization risk in excess of what is experienced in the core PBM business.\nLike many aspects of our business, the administration of the Medicare Part D program is complex and any failure to effectively execute the provisions of the Medicare Part D program may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows. As described above, the Health Reform Laws contain various changes to the Medicare Part D program and could have a financial impact on our Medicare Part D PDP and our clients\u2019 demands for our other Medicare Part D products and services.\nWe have historically engaged in strategic transactions, including the acquisition of other companies or businesses, and may engage in similar transactions in the future. Our failure to effectively execute on such transactions or to integrate any acquired businesses could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The acquisition and integration of any such business typically generates significant transaction costs and requires significant resources and management attention.\nWe have historically engaged in strategic transactions, including the acquisition of other companies and businesses. These transactions typically involve the integration of core business operations and technology infrastructure platforms that require significant resources and management attention and, among other things, risk client service disruption. Strategic transactions, including the pursuit of such transactions, often require us to incur significant up-front costs. These costs are typically non-recurring expenses related to the assessment, due diligence, negotiation and execution of the transaction. We may also incur additional costs to retain key employees as well as transaction fees and costs related to executing our integration plans. A failure or significant delay in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our client service or our business and results of operations. In addition, such transactions may yield higher operating costs, greater customer attrition or more significant business disruption than anticipated. Further, even if the integration is successful, there can be no assurance a transaction will result in the realization of the expected benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, or that any realized benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or an otherwise reasonable period of time.\nThe combination of Medco\u2019s business and ESI\u2019s business has been a complex, costly and time-consuming process. This integration has resulted in, and may continue to result in, challenges which could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, diversion of management\u2019s time and energy or other negative impacts on the business, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals and a failure to adequately protect such information could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMost of our activities involve the receipt or use of protected health information concerning individuals. We also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third-party data aggregators and analysts. There is substantial regulation at the federal and state levels addressing the use, disclosure and security of patient identifiable health information. At the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively \u201cHIPAA\u201d) impose extensive requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in health care\ndelivery, including physicians, hospitals, insurers and other payors. Many of these obligations were expanded under the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Failure to comply with standards issued pursuant to federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition to these regulations, future regulations and legislation that severely restricts or prohibits our use of patient identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. Furthermore, if we violate a patient\u2019s privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of protected health information, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties and suffer reputational harm, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur debt service obligations reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity. Our inability to access the credit markets for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe currently have debt outstanding, including indebtedness of ESI and Medco guaranteed by us. Our debt service obligations reduce the funds available for other business purposes. Increases in interest rates on variable rate indebtedness would increase our interest expense and could materially adversely affect our financial results. At December 31, 2014, we had $1,315.8 million of gross obligations which were subject to variable rates of interest under our credit agreement. A hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1% would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $13.2 million (pre-tax), assuming obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant.\nWe are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, such as the insufficiency of cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, certain of our debt instruments contain covenants which include limitations or qualifications on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, initiate or permit liens on assets, and engage in mergers, consolidations or disposals. The covenants under our credit agreement also include, among other things, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our credit agreement or the senior notes indentures, we would be in default under the credit agreement and/or the senior notes indentures, and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or otherwise not be able to draw down against our revolving credit facility. Under such circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Our inability to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the credit markets for any reason, whether due to market conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See Note 7 - Financing to our consolidated financial statements included in \u201cPart II - Item 8\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of government spending or appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our revenues are ultimately sourced from government spending and appropriated funds. The failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with, among other things:\n\u2022\ndiscounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery pharmacies\n\u2022\nrebates based on distributions of drugs from our home delivery pharmacies and through pharmacies in our retail networks\n\u2022\nadministrative fees for managing rebate programs, including the development and maintenance of formularies which include the particular manufacturer\u2019s products\n\u2022\naccess to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals\nThe consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers, the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships, or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, formulary fee programs have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. Adoption of new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, rules or regulations, relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.\nContracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and with PBM and specialty pharmacy clients, generally use \u201caverage wholesale price\u201d or \u201cAWP,\u201d which is published by a third party, as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs. In the event (i) AWP is no longer published by third parties, (ii) we adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry or (iii) future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations, we can give no assurance the short- or long-term impact of such changes to industry pricing benchmarks or drug prices will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLegislation and other regulations affecting drug prices are described in more detail under \u201cPart I - Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation and Compliance - Legislation and Regulation Affecting Drug Prices\u201d above.\nPending and future litigation, investigations or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties and/or require us to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation, enforcement action, regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations and other similar actions in connection with our business operations, including without limitation the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our specialty and home delivery pharmacies, services rendered in connection with our disease management offering, our pharmaceutical services operations, pharmacy benefit management services and mergers and acquisitions activity. These proceedings seek unspecified monetary damages and/or equitable relief. While we believe these proceedings are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such proceedings. If one or more of these proceedings has an unfavorable outcome, we cannot provide any assurance it would not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain clients as a result of any negative reputational impact of such an outcome. Further, while certain costs are covered by insurance, we may incur uninsured costs that are material to our financial performance in the defense of such proceedings.\nCommercial liability insurance coverage continues to be difficult to obtain for companies in our business sector, as such insurance can cause unexpected volatility in premiums and/or retention requirements dictated by insurance carriers. We have established certain self-insurance accruals to cover anticipated losses within our retained liability for previously reported claims and the cost to defend these claims. However, there can be no assurance such accruals will cover actual losses or that general, professional, managed care errors and omissions, and/or other liability insurance coverage will be reasonably available in the future or such insurance coverage, together with our self-insurance accruals, will be adequate to cover future claims. A claim, or claims, in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession and retention for our Chief Executive Officer and other key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.\nOur ability to attract and retain a qualified and experienced workforce is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, or an unexpected loss of leadership, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our failure to adequately plan for succession of our Chief Executive Officer, senior management and other key employees or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.", "PERMNO": 77668, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "ESRX"}
