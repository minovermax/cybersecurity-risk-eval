Risk Factors\nGrowth Strategies and Acquisitions - Our growth strategies may not provide the return on investment desired if we are not successful in implementation of these strategies.\nMaking acquisitions, investing in new products, expanding geographically and targeting new industries are among our growth strategies. We may not obtain the return on investment desired if we are not successful in implementing these growth strategies. Suitable acquisitions must be located, completed and effectively integrated into or added to our existing businesses or corporate structure for this growth strategy to be successful. We may not be able to obtain financing at a reasonable cost. We may be unsuccessful in acquiring and effectively integrating into or adding businesses to our current operations or corporate structure. We\nmay not realize projected efficiencies and cost-savings from the businesses we acquire. We cannot predict how customers, competitors, suppliers and employees will react to the acquisitions that we make. If acquired businesses do not meet performance expectations, assets acquired could be subject to impairment. We make significant investments in developing products that have innovative features and differentiated technology in their industries and in niche markets. We are adding to the geographies in which we do business with third party distributors. We cannot predict whether and when we will be able to realize the expected financial results and accretive effect of the acquisitions that we make, the new products that we develop and the channel expansions that we make.\nDivestiture - Our acquisition of the finishing businesses of ITW includes a requirement that we divest the acquired Liquid Finishing businesses, which has not been completed and remains subject to FTC approval.\nIn April 2012, we completed our purchase of the finishing businesses of ITW. The acquisition included Powder Finishing and Liquid Finishing equipment operations, technologies and brands. Results of the Powder Finishing businesses have been included in the Industrial segment since the date of acquisition. Pursuant to a March 2012 order, the Liquid Finishing businesses were to be held separate from the rest of Graco\u2019s businesses while the FTC considered a settlement with Graco and determined which portions of the Liquid Finishing business Graco must divest. The FTC approved a final decision and order on October 6, 2014, which became effective on October 9, 2014. Pursuant to the final order, Graco must sell the Liquid Finishing business assets within 180 days of the effective date. On October 8, 2014, the Company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Liquid Finishing business assets for $590 million cash, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The sale transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2015. Nonetheless, we cannot be certain to what extent or when the required regulatory approval of a buyer and terms of the sale will be obtained, or whether the Company will be able to complete a divestiture in a time frame that is satisfactory to the FTC. Graco will continue to hold the Liquid Finishing businesses separate and maintain them as viable and competitive until the sale process is complete.\nEconomic Environment - Demand for our products depends on the level of commercial and industrial activity worldwide.\nAn economic downturn or financial market turmoil may depress demand for our equipment in all major geographies and markets. If our distributors and original equipment manufacturers are unable to purchase our products because of unavailable credit or unfavorable credit terms or are simply unwilling to purchase our products, our net sales and earnings will be adversely affected. An economic downturn may affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in the terms of our financing arrangements.\nCurrency - Changes in currency translation rates could adversely impact our revenue and earnings.\nChanges in exchange rates will impact our reported sales and earnings. A majority of our manufacturing and cost structure is based in the United States. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our distributors to purchase products.\nChanges in Laws and Regulations - Changes may impact how we can do business and the cost of doing business around the world.\nThe speed and frequency of implementation and the complexity of new or revised laws and regulations globally appear to be increasing. In addition, as our business grows and/or geographically expands, we may become subject to laws and regulations previously inapplicable to our business. These laws and regulations increase our costs of doing business, may affect the manner in which our products will be produced or delivered and may impact our long-term ability to provide returns to our shareholders.\nAnti-Corruption Laws - We may incur costs and suffer damages if our employees, agents, distributors or suppliers violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations.\nBribery, corruption and trade laws and regulations, and enforcement thereof, is increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties and reputational damage.\nIntellectual Property - Demand for our products may be affected by new entrants who copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.\nFrom time to time, we have been faced with instances where competitors have infringed or improperly used our intellectual property and/or taken advantage of our design and development efforts. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Competitors who copy our products are becoming more prevalent in Asia. If we are unable to effectively meet these challenges, they could adversely affect our revenues and profits and hamper our ability to grow.\nForeign Operations - Conducting business internationally exposes our Company to risks that could harm our business.\nIn 2014, approximately 53 percent of our sales were generated by customers located outside the United States. We are increasing our presence in advancing economies. Operating and selling outside of the United States exposes us to certain risks that could adversely impact our sales volume, rate of growth or profitability. These risks include: complying with foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers and other restrictions), protection of our proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, potential difficulties staffing and managing local operations, and changes in exchange rates.\nCompetition - Our success depends upon our ability to develop, market and sell new products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, and anticipate industry changes.\nOur profitability will be affected if we do not develop new products and technologies that meet our customers\u2019 needs. Our ability to develop, market and sell products that meet our customers\u2019 needs depends upon a number of factors, including anticipating the features and products that our customers will need in the future, identifying and entering into new markets, and training our distributors. Changes in industries in which we participate, including consolidation of competitors and customers, could affect our success. Price competition and competitor strategies could affect our success.\nSuppliers - Risks associated with foreign sourcing, supply interruption, delays in raw material or component delivery, supply shortages and counterfeit components may adversely affect our production or profitability.\nWe are sourcing an increasing percentage of our materials and components from suppliers outside the United States, and from suppliers within the United States who engage in foreign sourcing. Long lead times or supply interruptions associated with a global supply base may reduce our flexibility and make it more difficult to respond promptly to fluctuations in demand or respond quickly to product quality problems. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies and fluctuations in the price of commodities may impact the manufacturing costs of our products and affect our profitability. Protective tariffs, unpredictable changes in duty rates, and trade regulation changes may make certain foreign-sourced parts no longer competitively priced. Long supply chains may be disrupted by environmental events or other political factors. Raw materials may become limited in availability from certain regions. Port labor disputes may delay shipments. We source a large volume and a variety of electronic components, which exposes us to an increased risk of counterfeit components entering our supply chain. If counterfeit components unknowingly become part of our products, we may need to stop delivery and rebuild our products. We may be subject to warranty claims and may need to recall products.\nSecurity Breaches - Intrusion into our information systems may impact our business.\nSecurity breaches or intrusion into our information systems, and the breakdown, interruption in or inadequate upgrading or maintenance of our information processing software, hardware or networks may adversely affect our business. Security breaches or intrusion into the systems or data of the third parties with whom we conduct business may also harm our business.\nPolitical Instability - Uncertainty surrounding political leadership may limit our growth opportunities.\nDomestic political instability, including government shut downs, may limit our ability to grow our business. International political instability may prevent us from expanding our business into certain geographies and may also limit our ability to grow our business. Terrorist activities and civil disturbances may harm our business.\nLegal Proceedings - Costs associated with claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and regulatory reviews, and potentially adverse outcomes, may affect our profitability.\nAs our Company grows, we are at an increased risk of being a target in litigation, administrative proceedings and regulatory reviews. The cost of defending such matters appears to be increasing, particularly in the United States. We may also need to pursue claims or litigation to protect our interests. Such costs may adversely affect our Company\u2019s profitability. Our businesses expose us to potential toxic tort, product liability and commercial claims. Successful claims against the Company may adversely affect our results.\nMajor Customers - Our Contractor segment depends on a few large customers for a significant portion of its sales. Significant declines in the level of purchases by these customers could reduce our sales and impact segment profitability.\nOur Contractor segment derives a significant amount of revenue from a few large customers. Substantial decreases in purchases by these customers, difficulty in collecting amounts due or the loss of their business would adversely affect the profitability of this segment. The business of these customers is dependent upon the economic vitality of the construction and home maintenance markets. If these markets decline, the business of our customers could be adversely affected and their purchases of our equipment could decrease.\nVariable Industries - Our success may be affected by variations in the construction and automotive industries.\nOur business may be affected by fluctuations in residential, commercial and institutional building and remodeling activity. Changes in construction materials and techniques may also impact our business. Our business may also be affected by fluctuations of activity in the automotive industry.\nNatural Disasters - Our operations are at risk of damage or destruction by natural disasters or fire.\nThe loss of, or substantial damage to, one of our facilities could make it difficult to supply our customers with product and provide our employees with work. Flooding, tornadoes, typhoons, unusually heavy precipitation, earthquakes or fire could adversely impact our operations.", "PERMNO": 39571, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "GGG"}
