{"cik": "1549756", "company": "LinnCo, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business has many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our shares are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we and LINN Energy file with the SEC. Because our only significant assets are the units issued by LINN Energy, our success is dependent solely upon the operation and management of LINN Energy and its resulting performance. The risk factors that affect LINN Energy also affect LinnCo; see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d within LINN Energy\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in this filing as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.\nIf we are unable to pay our current liabilities, including our income taxes payable, as they becomes due, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had income taxes payable of approximately $30 million and cash of approximately $11 million. Our only significant asset is our interest in LINN Energy units and our cash flow, which was historically used to pay dividends to our shareholders, is completely dependent upon the ability of LINN Energy to make distributions to its unitholders. In October 2015, LINN Energy suspended the payment of its distribution. Accordingly, the uncertainty associated with our ability to meet our commitments as they come due raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report we received with respect to our financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur cash flow consists exclusively of distributions from LINN Energy.\nOur only significant assets are the LINN Energy units representing limited liability company interests in LINN Energy that we own. Therefore, our cash flow is completely dependent upon the ability of LINN Energy to make distributions to its unitholders. Subject to amounts reserved in the discretion of LINN Energy\u2019s board of directors to provide for the proper conduct of its business, LINN Energy\u2019s limited liability company agreement provides that it makes distributions to its\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nunitholders of available cash. LINN Energy\u2019s board of directors has the ability under its limited liability company agreement to establish a cash reserve, which could encompass all of the cash otherwise available for distributions to its unitholders, to provide for the proper conduct of its business in both the short and long term, including for reduction of indebtedness of LINN Energy. In 2015, in response to economic conditions and continued low commodity prices, LINN Energy reduced then later suspended its distribution to its unitholders. Since we pay our dividend from the receipt of cash distributions from LINN Energy, we will not pay a dividend while LINN Energy\u2019s distributions are suspended and we will have no cash flow available to fund any expenses or costs not covered by LINN Energy.\nIf LINN Energy is unable to repay or refinance its existing and future debt as it becomes due, whether at maturity or as a result of acceleration, it may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nLINN Energy has significant indebtedness under its May 2019 senior notes, November 2019 senior notes, April 2020 senior notes, Berry November 2020 senior notes, December 2020 senior secured second lien notes, February 2021 senior notes, September 2021 senior notes and Berry September 2022 senior notes (collectively, \u201cnotes\u201d) and its credit facilities. As a result of its indebtedness, LINN Energy uses a significant portion of its cash flow to pay interest and principal (when due) on its notes and credit facilities, which reduces the cash available to finance its operations and other business activities and limits its flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates.\nBased on its current estimates and expectations for commodity prices in 2016, LINN Energy does not expect to remain in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants contained in its credit facilities throughout 2016 unless those requirements are waived or amended. Additionally, the borrowing bases under LINN Energy\u2019s credit facilities are subject to redeterminations in April 2016. Because its credit facilities are effectively fully drawn, any reduction in the borrowing bases would require LINN Energy to make mandatory prepayments to the extent existing indebtedness exceeds the new borrowing bases. LINN Energy also has substantial interest payments due during the next twelve months on its notes and its credit facilities. If LINN Energy fails to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in its credit facilities or the indentures governing its notes, an Event of Default (as defined in the applicable agreements) could result, which would permit acceleration of the indebtedness under certain circumstances and could result in an Event of Default and acceleration of its other debt and permit its secured lenders to foreclose on any of its assets securing such debt. Any accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable.\nWhile LINN Energy is attempting to take appropriate mitigating actions to refinance any indebtedness prior to its maturity or otherwise extend the maturity dates, and to cure any potential defaults, there is no assurance that any particular actions with respect to refinancing existing indebtedness, extending the maturity of existing indebtedness or curing potential defaults in its existing and future debt agreements will be sufficient. The uncertainty associated with LINN Energy\u2019s ability to meet its obligations as they become due raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The report of LINN Energy\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies its audited consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nLINN Energy is currently in default under its Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\u201cLINN Credit Facility\u201d) and the indenture governing its second lien notes (\u201cSecond Lien Indenture\u201d).\nUnder the LINN Credit Facility, LINN Energy is required to deliver audited consolidated financial statements without a going concern or like qualification or explanation. Because the audit report prepared by its auditors with respect to the consolidated financial statements includes such going concern explanation, LINN Energy is in default under the LINN Credit Facility as of its filing date, March 15, 2016.\nIf LINN Energy is unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the LINN Credit Facility prior to the expiration of the 30 day grace period, an Event of Default will result and the lenders holding a majority of the commitments under the LINN Credit Facility could accelerate the outstanding indebtedness, which would make it immediately due and payable. If LINN Energy is unable to obtain a waiver from or otherwise reach an agreement with the lenders under the LINN Credit Facility and the indebtedness under the LINN Credit Facility is accelerated, then an Event of Default under LINN Energy\u2019s senior notes and second lien notes would occur, which, if it continues beyond any applicable cure periods, would, to the extent the applicable lenders so elect, result in the acceleration of those obligations. Furthermore, an Event of Default under the LINN Credit Facility will also result in an Event of Default under Berry Petroleum Company,\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nLLC\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\u201cBerry Credit Facility\u201d), which in the absence of a waiver or other suitable relief and upon the election of the agent or lenders holding a majority of commitments under the Berry Credit Facility would result in the acceleration of indebtedness under the Berry Credit Facility. Such Event of Default would trigger an Event of Default under the Berry senior notes. If such Event of Default continues beyond any applicable cure periods, such Event of Default would result in an acceleration of the Berry senior notes.\nAdditionally, the Second Lien Indenture required LINN Energy to deliver mortgages by February 18, 2016, subject to a 45 day grace period. LINN Energy elected to exercise its right to the grace period and not deliver the mortgages, and as a result, LINN Energy is currently in default under the Second Lien Indenture. If LINN Energy does not deliver the mortgages within the 45 day grace period or is otherwise unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the holders under the Second Lien Indenture prior to the expiration of the 45 day grace period, an Event of Default (as defined in the Second Lien Indenture) will result and the trustee or note holders holding at least 25% in the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding second lien notes could accelerate the outstanding second lien notes, causing the second lien notes to be immediately due and payable.\nIf lenders, and subsequently noteholders, accelerate LINN Energy\u2019s outstanding indebtedness, it will become immediately due and payable and LINN Energy will not have sufficient liquidity to repay those amounts. LINN Energy is currently in discussions with various stakeholders and is pursuing or considering a number of actions, but there can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity can be obtained from one or more of these actions or that these actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations, and LINN Energy could be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and as a result, may result in LinnCo filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe and LINN Energy may seek the protection of the United States Bankruptcy Court (\u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) which may harm our businesses and place equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in us.\nWe and LINN Energy have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives through a private restructuring. However, a filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 11\u201d) may be unavoidable. Seeking Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our and LINN Energy\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. As long as a Chapter 11 proceeding continues, our and LINN Energy\u2019s senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our and LINN Energy\u2019s business. Also during the Chapter 11 proceedings, LINN Energy\u2019s ability to enter into new commodity derivatives covering additional estimated future production would be dependent upon either entering into unsecured hedges or obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval to enter into secured hedges. Furthermore, counterparties under its existing hedge transactions may elect to terminate those transactions in connection with a bankruptcy filing without its consent.\nLINN Energy has a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to its units in its capital structure. As a result, LINN Energy believes that seeking Bankruptcy Court protection under a Chapter 11 proceeding could cause its units to be canceled, result in a limited recovery for unitholders, if any, and place current LINN Energy equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in it. Additionally, a Chapter 11 proceeding could cause our shares to be canceled, result in a limited recovery for shareholders, if any, and place current LinnCo equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in us.\nFailure to maintain the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market could result in delisting of our common shares, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common shares and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) and the continued listing of our common shares on NASDAQ is subject to our ability to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per common share. If we fail to satisfy such requirement for a period of 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will send us a deficiency notice indicating that we have a compliance period of 180 calendar days from such notice to cure the deficiency by satisfying the minimum bid requirement for a\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nminimum of ten consecutive business days. Failure to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement could result in delisting of our common shares from NASDAQ.\nTo date in 2016, the bid price of our common shares closed below the $1.00 per unit minimum bid price on several occasions. Any delisting from NASDAQ could have a negative impact on the market price and liquidity of our common shares. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to access the capital markets and result in the potential loss of confidence by investors.\nOur shares may trade at a substantial discount to the trading price of LINN Energy units.\nWe cannot predict whether our shares will trade at a discount or premium to the trading price of LINN Energy units. If we incur substantial corporate income tax liabilities on income allocated to us by LINN Energy with respect to LINN Energy units we own, the cash dividends you receive per share, if any, will be substantially less than the cash distributions per unit that we receive from LINN Energy. In addition, in the event of a merger, tender offer, going private transaction or sale of all or substantially all of our assets (\u201cTerminal Transaction\u201d) the net proceeds you receive from us per share may, as a result of our corporate income tax liabilities on the transaction and other factors, be substantially lower than the net proceeds per unit received by a direct LINN Energy unitholder. As a result of these considerations, our shares may trade at a substantial discount to the trading price of LINN Energy units.\nOur shareholders are only able to indirectly vote on matters in which LINN Energy unitholders are entitled to vote, and our shareholders are not entitled to vote to elect our directors.\nOur shareholders will only be able to indirectly vote on matters in which LINN Energy unitholders are entitled to vote, and our shareholders are not entitled to vote to elect our directors. Therefore, you will only be able to indirectly influence the management and board of directors of LINN Energy, but you will not be able to directly influence or change our management or board of directors. If our shareholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our directors, they have no ability to remove the directors and have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our board of directors. Rather, our board of directors is appointed by the holder of our sole voting share, which is LINN Energy. Our limited liability company agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of holders of our shares to call meetings or to obtain information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the ability of holders of our shares to influence the manner or direction of management.\nLINN Energy may issue additional units without your approval or other classes of units, and we may issue additional shares, which would dilute our direct and your indirect ownership interest in LINN Energy and your ownership interest in us.\nLINN Energy\u2019s limited liability company agreement does not limit the number of additional limited liability company interests, including interests that rank senior to the LINN Energy units, that it may issue at any time without the approval of its unitholders. The issuance by LINN Energy of additional units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour proportionate ownership interest in LINN Energy will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit, including the LINN Energy units we hold and vote in accordance with the vote of our shareholders, may be reduced;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available for distribution on each LINN Energy unit may decrease, resulting in a decrease in the amount of cash available to pay dividends to you; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the LINN Energy units may decline, resulting in a decline in the market price of our shares.\nIn addition, our limited liability company agreement does not limit the number of additional shares that we may issue at any time without your approval. The issuance by us of additional shares will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nyour proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share you own will be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our shares may decline.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nThe terms of our shares may be changed in ways you may not like, because our board of directors has the power to change the terms of our shares in ways our board determines are not materially adverse to you.\nAs an owner of our shares, you may not like the changes made to the terms of our shares, if any, and you may disagree with our board of directors\u2019 decision that the changes are not materially adverse to you as a shareholder. Your recourse if you disagree is limited because our limited liability company agreement gives broad latitude and discretion to our board of directors and limits the fiduciary duties that our officers and directors otherwise would owe to you.\nOur limited liability company agreement limits the fiduciary duties owed by our officers and directors to our shareholders, and LINN Energy\u2019s limited liability company agreement limits the fiduciary duties owed by LINN Energy\u2019s officers and directors to its unitholders, including us.\nOur limited liability company agreement has modified, waived and limited the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors that would otherwise apply at law or in equity and replaced such duties with a contractual duty requiring our officers and directors to act in good faith. For purposes of our limited liability company agreement, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if the person subjectively believes that the action or omission of action is in, or not opposed to, the best interests of LinnCo. In addition, any action or omission shall be deemed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of LinnCo and our shareholders if the person making the determination subjectively believes that such action or omission of action is in, or not opposed to, the best interest of LINN Energy and all its unitholders, taken together, and such person may take into account the totality of the relationship between LINN Energy and us. In addition, when acting in any capacity other than as one of our officers or directors, including when acting in their individual capacities or as officers or directors of LINN Energy or any affiliate of LINN Energy, our officers and directors will not be required to act in good faith and will have no obligation to take into account our interests or the interests of our shareholders.\nThe above modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted by Delaware law. Thus, we and our shareholders will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our board of directors if they breach their obligations pursuant to our limited liability company agreement. Furthermore, even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our limited liability company agreement, that agreement provides that our officers and directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders, except for acts or omissions not in good faith.\nThese provisions restrict the remedies available to our shareholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty, including fiduciary duties. In addition, LINN Energy\u2019s limited liability company agreement also limits the fiduciary duties owed by LINN Energy\u2019s officers and directors to its unitholders, including us.\nOur limited liability company agreement prohibits a shareholder who acquires 15% or more of our shares or voting power with respect to 15% or more of the outstanding LINN Energy units without the approval of our or LINN Energy\u2019s board of directors from engaging in a business combination with us or with LINN Energy for three years. This provision could discourage a change of control of us or of LINN Energy that our shareholders may favor, which could negatively affect the price of our shares.\nOur limited liability company agreement effectively adopts Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Laws (\u201cDGCL\u201d). Section 203 of the DGCL as it applies to us prevents an interested shareholder, defined as a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding shares or voting power with respect to 15% or more of the outstanding LINN Energy units, from engaging in business combinations with us or with LINN Energy for three years following the time such person becomes an interested shareholder. Section 203 broadly defines \u201cbusiness combination\u201d to encompass a wide variety of transactions with or caused by an interested shareholder, including mergers, asset sales and other transactions in which the interested shareholder receives a benefit on other than a pro rata basis with other shareholders. This provision of our limited liability company agreement could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares or LINN Energy\u2019s units.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and rely on exemptions from various corporate governance requirements.\nOur shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. A \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may elect not to comply with various corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ, including the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, and the requirement that its nominating, governance and compensation committees consist of all independent directors.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d because LINN Energy holds our sole voting share and has the sole power to elect our board of directors. Because we rely on certain of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions and do not have a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee, you do not have the same corporate governance advantages afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nYour shares are subject to limited call rights that could result in you having to involuntarily sell your shares at a time or price that may be undesirable.\nIf LINN Energy or any of its affiliates owns 80% or more of our outstanding shares, LINN Energy has the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates, to purchase all of our remaining outstanding shares at a purchase price not less than the greater of the then-current market price of our shares and the highest price paid for our shares by LINN Energy or one of its affiliates during the prior 90 days. If LINN Energy exercises any of its rights to purchase our shares, you may be required to sell your shares at a time or price that may be undesirable, and you could receive less than you paid for your shares. Any sale of our shares, to LINN Energy or otherwise, for cash will be a taxable transaction to the owner of the shares sold. Accordingly, a gain or loss will be recognized on the sale equal to the difference between the cash received and the owner\u2019s tax basis in the shares sold.\nIn addition, if at any time a person owns more than 90% of the outstanding LINN Energy units, such person may elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the remaining outstanding LINN Energy units at a price equal to the higher of the current market price (as defined in LINN Energy\u2019s limited liability company agreement) and the highest price paid by such person or any of its affiliates for any LINN Energy units purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date notice was mailed to the LINN Energy unitholders informing them of such election. In this case, we will be required to tender all of our outstanding LINN Energy units and distribute the cash we receive, net of income taxes payable by us, to our shareholders. Following such distribution, we will dissolve and wind up our affairs. Thus, upon the election of a holder of 90% of the outstanding LINN Energy units, you may receive a distribution that is effectively less than the price at which you would prefer to sell your shares.\nShareholders who are not \u201cEligible Holders\u201d will be subject to redemption of their shares.\nIn order to comply with U.S. laws with respect to the ownership of interests in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands, we have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our shares. As used herein, an Eligible Holder means a person or entity qualified to hold an interest in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. Shareholders who are not persons or entities who meet the requirements to be an Eligible Holder will not be entitled to receive distributions in kind on their shares in a liquidation and they run the risk of having their shares redeemed by us at the then-current market price.\nTax Risks\nWe will incur corporate income tax liabilities on income allocated to us by LINN Energy with respect to LINN Energy units we own, which may be substantial. We are required to pay taxes with respect to our share of LINN Energy\u2019s taxable income, including our share of ordinary income and capital gain upon dispositions of properties by LINN Energy or cancellation of debt by LINN Energy, even if we do not receive any cash distributions from LINN Energy to fund any resulting tax liability. If cash tax liabilities are owed as a result of our share of LINN Energy\u2019s taxable income and we do not have sufficient cash to pay our tax liabilities, the value of our shares could be materially reduced. Our share of LINN Energy\u2019s taxable income, gain, loss and deduction, or specific items thereof, may be substantially different than our interest in LINN Energy\u2019s economic profits.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nWe are classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in most states in which LINN Energy does business, for state income tax purposes. Under current law, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates of up to 35% (and a 20% alternative minimum tax in certain cases), and to state income tax at rates that vary from state to state, on the net income allocated to us by LINN Energy with respect to the LINN Energy units we own. The amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders, if any, will be reduced by the amount of any such income taxes payable by us for which we establish reserves.\nThe amount of income taxes payable by us depends on a number of factors including LINN Energy\u2019s earnings from its operations, the amount of those earnings allocated to us and the amount of the distributions paid to us, if any, by LINN Energy.\nTo the extent a cash tax liability is owed, we are required to pay such taxes whether or not we receive any cash distributions from LINN Energy. Even if LINN Energy\u2019s distributions are reinstated, we may not receive cash distributions from LINN Energy equal to any cash tax liability we owe.\nOur share of LINN Energy\u2019s taxable income will include any cancellation of debt (\u201cCOD\u201d) income recognized upon the satisfaction of LINN Energy\u2019s outstanding indebtedness for total consideration less than the adjusted issue price (and any accrued but unpaid interest) of such indebtedness. During 2015, LINN Energy repurchased and exchanged approximately $3.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes at a significant discount, resulting in substantial COD income allocations to us. LINN Energy may engage in other transactions that result in COD income in the future. We may exclude COD income allocated to us by LINN Energy from our gross income to the extent our liabilities (including certain liabilities of LINN Energy that are allocated to us under applicable tax rules) exceed the value of our assets, in which case we must apply the excluded amounts to reduce our tax attributes, such as net operating losses and our tax basis in the LINN Energy units we own. To the extent we qualify to reduce our tax attributes rather than including any COD income in our current income, our future taxable income may be greater. To the extent we must include any COD income in our current income, we may have a substantial current cash tax liability without a corresponding distribution of cash from LINN Energy to fund the payment of such liability.\nIn addition, LINN Energy may sell a portion of its properties and use the proceeds to pay down debt or acquire other properties rather than distributing the proceeds to its unitholders, including us, and some or all of LINN Energy\u2019s unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable income or loss with respect to that sale.\nOur share of LINN Energy\u2019s taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof) may be substantially greater than, or LINN Energy\u2019s tax losses and deductions (or specific items thereof) may be substantially less than, our interest in LINN Energy\u2019s economic profits because of allocations under section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn addition, our income tax liabilities could be substantial if any of the following occurs:\n\u2022\nLINN Energy significantly decreases its drilling activity;\n\u2022\nLINN Energy issues a significant amount of additional units without a corresponding increase in the aggregate tax deductions generated by LINN Energy;\n\u2022\nwe sell all or a portion of the LINN Energy units we own;\n\u2022\ntax carryforwards (if any) available become subject to further limitations on their annual usage;\n\u2022\nproposed legislation is enacted that eliminates the current deduction of intangible drilling costs and other tax incentives to the oil and natural gas industry; or\n\u2022\nthere is a significant increase in oil and natural gas prices.\nLINN Energy is not required to pay tax liabilities on our behalf. The value of our shares could be materially reduced if we do not have sufficient cash to pay our tax liabilities.\nLINN Energy is exploring strategic alternatives to strengthen its balance sheet and maximize its value. LINN Energy may consider alternatives that could have significant adverse tax consequences to us, which may materially reduce the value of our shares.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nLINN Energy is exploring strategic alternatives to strengthen its balance sheet and maximize its value. LINN Energy may consider alternatives that could have significant adverse tax consequences to us, which may materially reduce the value of our shares. For example, LINN Energy may engage in additional transactions that result in significant COD income to us. As described above, any such COD income allocated to us with respect to our LINN Energy units may either cause us to reduce our tax attributes or to have a cash tax liability, potentially with no corresponding distribution of cash to fund the payment of any resulting tax liability to us. In addition, LINN Energy may engage in transactions that trigger our tax gain or loss with respect to the LINN Energy units that we own. A transaction that triggers our gain may not be accompanied by any receipt of cash to fund the payment of the resulting tax liability to us. Any loss to us upon any such transaction may be permanently disallowed, which may increase our future tax liability.\nWe are subject to statutory tax audits of our income tax returns and our income tax liabilities could be substantially higher than we project after such audits.\nWe and LINN Energy are subject to statutory tax audits pursuant to federal and state regulations, in particular for tax positions taken by Berry in prior fiscal years. After such audits, the tax authorities may disagree with and disallow certain tax positions that we and LINN Energy have inherited from Berry in the 2013 Berry acquisition. If we and LINN Energy are unable to prevail in an administrative or court proceeding to sustain some or all of the positions taken by Berry, we may be subject to substantial income tax liabilities and corresponding penalties and interest, which may be immediately due. Any adverse decision by the tax authorities or in an administrative or court proceeding may result in our need to reserve cash to fund any such potential or actual income tax liabilities.\nChanges to current U.S. federal tax laws may affect our ability to take certain tax deductions.\nSubstantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would affect, among other things, our ability to take certain deductions related to LINN Energy\u2019s operations, including deductions for intangible drilling costs and deductions for costs associated with U.S. production activities. We are unable to predict whether any changes, or other proposals to such laws, ultimately will be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our shares.\nUpon a Terminal Transaction, we may be entitled to a smaller distribution per LINN Energy unit we own than other LINN Energy unitholders, and we may incur substantial corporate income tax liabilities in the transaction or upon the distribution of the proceeds from the transaction to you, in which case the net proceeds you receive from us per share may be substantially lower than the net proceeds per unit received by a direct LINN Energy unitholder.\nUpon a Terminal Transaction, LINN Energy unitholders will receive distributions in accordance with the positive balances in their respective capital accounts related to their units. Our capital account related to the LINN Energy units that we own may be lower than the capital accounts of other LINN Energy unitholders. Therefore, we could be entitled upon a dissolution of LINN Energy to a smaller distribution per LINN Energy unit we own than other LINN Energy unitholders, unless adjustments are made to our capital accounts related to the LINN Energy units that we own.\nEach time LINN Energy issues or redeems units, it is required to adjust the capital accounts in all outstanding LINN Energy units upward to the extent of the \u201cunrealized gains\u201d in LINN Energy\u2019s assets or downward to the extent of the \u201cunrealized losses\u201d in LINN Energy\u2019s assets immediately prior to such issuance or redemption. In general, the difference between the fair market value of each such asset and its adjusted tax basis equals the unrealized gain (if the fair market value exceeds the adjusted tax basis) or the unrealized loss (if the adjusted tax basis exceeds the fair market value). Unrealized gains and losses generally are allocated among the LINN Energy unitholders in the same manner as other items of LINN Energy income, gain, deduction or loss.\nThe board of directors of LINN Energy, however, is authorized to make disproportionate allocations of income and deductions, including allocations of unrealized gains and losses, to the extent necessary to cause the capital accounts of all LINN Energy units to be the same. We anticipate that there will be sufficient unrealized gains or losses in connection with future issuances or redemptions of LINN Energy units in order for LINN Energy to allocate to us sufficient unrealized gains, or to allocate sufficient unrealized losses to other holders of LINN Energy units, to cause the capital accounts related to the LINN Energy units that we own to be the same as the capital accounts of all other LINN Energy units and result in us being entitled upon the dissolution of LINN Energy to the same distribution per LINN Energy unit we own as other LINN Energy unitholders. However, there can be no assurance that such adjustments will occur or that any adjustments that do occur will\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nbe sufficient to eliminate the difference between our capital account related to the LINN Energy units that we own and the capital accounts of other LINN Energy unitholders related to their LINN Energy units.\nWe are classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in most states in which LINN Energy does business, for state income tax purposes. Upon a Terminal Transaction, we will be required to liquidate and distribute the net after-tax proceeds from the transaction to you. We may incur substantial corporate income tax liabilities upon such a transaction or upon our distribution to you of the proceeds from the transaction. The tax liability we incur will depend in part upon the amount by which the value of the LINN Energy units we own exceeds our tax basis in the units. As a result, we may incur substantial income tax liabilities upon such a transaction even if LINN Energy units decrease in value after we purchase them. The amount of cash or other property available for distribution to you upon our liquidation will be reduced by the amount of any such income taxes paid by us.\nAs a result of these factors, upon a Terminal Transaction, the net proceeds you receive from us per share may be substantially lower than the net proceeds per unit received by a direct LINN Energy unitholder.\nYour tax gain on the disposition of our shares could be more than expected, or your tax loss on the disposition of our shares could be less than expected.\nIf you sell your shares, or you receive a liquidating distribution from us, you will recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and your tax basis in those shares. Because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our earnings and profits decrease your tax basis in your shares, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the shares you sell or dispose of will, in effect, become taxable gain to you if you sell such shares at a price greater than your tax basis in those shares, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost.\nIf you are a U.S. holder of our shares, the IRS Forms 1099-DIV that you receive from your broker may over-report your dividend income, if any, with respect to our shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and failure to over-report your dividend income in a manner consistent with the IRS Forms 1099-DIV that you receive from your broker may cause the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to assert audit adjustments to your U.S. federal income tax return. If you are a non-U.S. holder of our shares, your broker or other withholding agent may over-withhold taxes from dividends paid to you, if any, in which case you would have to file a U.S. tax return if you wanted to claim a refund of the over-withheld tax.\nDividends we pay with respect to our shares, if any, will constitute \u201cdividends\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Dividends we pay in excess of our earnings and profits will not be treated as \u201cdividends\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes; instead, they will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in your shares and then as capital gain realized on the sale or exchange of such shares. We may be unable to timely determine the portion of our distributions that is a \u201cdividend\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf you are a U.S. holder of our shares, we may be unable to persuade brokers to prepare the IRS Forms 1099-DIV that they send to you in a manner that is consistent with our determination of the amount that constitutes a \u201cdividend\u201d to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes or you may receive a corrected IRS Form 1099-DIV (and you may therefore need to file an amended federal, state or local income tax return). We will attempt to timely notify you of available information to assist you with your income tax reporting (such as posting the correct information on our web site). However, the information that we provide to you may be inconsistent with the amounts reported to you by your broker on IRS Form 1099-DIV, and the IRS may disagree with any such information and may make audit adjustments to your tax return.\nIf you are a non-U.S. holder of our shares, \u201cdividends\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) unless the dividends are effectively connected with your conduct of U.S. trade or business. Because we may be unable to timely determine the portion of our distributions that is a \u201cdividend\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes or we may be unable to persuade your broker or withholding agent to withhold taxes from distributions in a manner consistent with our determination of the amount that constitutes a \u201cdividend\u201d for such purposes, your broker or other withholding agent may over-withhold taxes from distributions paid to you. In such a case, you would have to file a U.S. tax return to claim a refund of the over-withheld tax.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nLINN Energy\u2019s tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of additional entity level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat LINN Energy as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or it was to otherwise become subject to material additional entity level taxation for federal or state tax purposes, the value of LINN Energy units would be reduced and, as a result, the value of our shares would be reduced.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in LINN Energy units depends largely on it being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. LINN Energy has not requested a ruling from the IRS on this or any other tax matter that affects it.\nBecause LINN Energy\u2019s units are publicly traded, Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that LINN Energy derive at least 90% of its gross income each year from the marketing of oil and natural gas, or from certain other specified activities, in order to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that LINN Energy has satisfied this requirement and will continue to do so in the future, so we believe LINN Energy is and will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf LINN Energy were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rates, currently at a maximum rate of 35%. Distributions, if any, would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gain, loss, deduction or credit would flow through to unitholders. Because a tax may be imposed on LINN Energy as a corporation, its cash available to pay distributions to its unitholders, if and when resumed, could be reduced. Further, the value of LINN Energy units would be reduced and, as a result, the value of our shares would be reduced. In addition, if LINN Energy were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that would constitute a Terminal Transaction.\nCurrent law or LINN Energy\u2019s business may change and cause it to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject it to entity level taxation. Any modification to current law or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the requirements for partnership status, affect or cause LINN Energy to change its business activities, change the character or treatment of portions of its income and adversely affect our investment in its units.\nIn addition, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships and limited liability companies to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. For example, LINN Energy may be required to pay Texas franchise tax on its total revenue apportioned to Texas at a maximum effective rate of approximately 0.5%. Imposition of a similar entity-level tax on LINN Energy\u2019s income or receipts by any other state would reduce the amount of cash available to service debt or to pay distributions to its unitholders, if and when resumed. Further, the value of LINN Energy units would be reduced and, as a result, the value of our shares would be reduced.", "PERMNO": 13647, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LNCOQ"}
