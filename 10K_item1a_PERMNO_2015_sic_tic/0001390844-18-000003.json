RISK FACTORS\nAny of the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results as well as other factors included in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur sales could decline due to macro-economic factors, downturns in the industry, regulatory changes, and other factors outside of our control.\nChanges in economic conditions, significant downturns in our industry, regulatory changes impacting our supply chain and the purchasing patterns of commercial vehicles, including the ability to trade across borders and import and export our products, and changes in the local economies of the countries or regions in which we sell our products, such as changes in consumer confidence, increases in interest rates, inflation and increases in unemployment, could affect demand for our products, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nDemand for new trucks and buses in the markets in which we operate has a significant impact on our sales. Adverse economic conditions in our markets, particularly in Europe, and other factors may cause our customers to reduce truck and bus production, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA global recession would negatively impact our customers and result in reduced demand for our products, which would therefore have a significant negative impact on our business.\nDuring the 2008-2009 recession, the credit markets experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by significantly reduced availability of credit and increased borrowing costs. The disruptions in the credit markets and impacts of the global recession negatively impacted consumer spending patterns and caused our customers to reduce truck and bus production. During 2012, the commercial vehicle industry experienced an abrupt slowdown to the significant recovery seen in 2010 and 2011 in our more developed markets, in addition to double digit declines in some of our emerging markets, namely Brazil and China. A further global recession could cause our customers to again reduce truck and bus production, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations, our operating cash flows and our financial condition.\nOur exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. Dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe conduct business through subsidiaries in many different countries, including most of the major countries of Western and Eastern Europe, Brazil, Russia, China, South Korea, India, Thailand and Japan, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations, which are presented in U.S. Dollars. In 2017, approximately 82% of our combined sales occurred outside of the United States. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in best-cost countries and sold in various countries. Cross border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in exposure to foreign currency exchange effects. Accordingly, fluctuations in the currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations, especially fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies for the countries referred to above. Additionally, our results of operations are translated into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar results in unfavorable or favorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. Dollars.\nThe Company could be subject to an increase in its tax rates following the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, the tax rate in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. The Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nThe OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles relating to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). These changes are being adopted and implemented by many of the countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. In addition, the European Commission has launched several initiatives to implement BEPS actions including an anti-tax avoidance directive and having a common (consolidated) corporate tax base. It is unclear at present to what extent these initiatives will be implemented by the EU countries.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, from 35%, a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries at reduced tax rates regardless of whether the earnings are repatriated, new taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a minimum tax on payments to foreign related parties and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if, and to what extent, various U.S. states will conform to the new tax law which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nDuring 2017, the Company recognized provisional income tax expense of $67.6 million related to the Tax Act including $100.0 million for the one-time transition tax partially offset by a $32.4 million benefit for remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liability. The charge taken for the transition tax is provisional because the Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, and the Company was not able to complete its assessment of the income tax expense in time for the release of its 2017 audited financial statements with this Form 10-K. Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, the Company is making a reasonable estimate of the income tax expense for 2017, and the Company will continue to assess the accounting impacts of the Tax Act on its financial statements. The ultimate impact will be recorded in 2018 and may differ from these provisional amounts due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, and additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. There is a risk that the final assessment of the 2017 income tax expense may exceed the provisional charge, which may require the Company to record an additional expense in the 2018 period in which the Company is able to complete its assessment.\nOur annual cash tax rate will likely increase, perhaps significantly in future years, as a result of the European Commission\u2019s decision on the Belgian excess profit ruling program which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total profit or loss before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each tax paying entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. The Company has operations and a taxable presence in countries outside the United States and all of these countries have a tax rate that is different than the rate in the U.S. The country that has a material impact on lowering our global effective tax rate is Belgium, the location of our global headquarters.\nThe Belgian Tax Code contains provisions to reduce the taxable base of companies, through rulings granted by the Belgian Government under the excess profit ruling (EPR) program. WABCO qualified for the EPR program in 2012. On January 11, 2016, the European Commission ruled that the EPR program permitted under Belgian law is illegal and incompatible with European State Aid law (hereinafter referred to as the \"Decision\"). As a result, the European Commission required Belgium to stop applying the EPR program and to recover all past tax benefits received by applicable companies under the program (i.e. a \u201cclawback\u201d). The Company recorded an income tax provision of $69.3 million during 2016 with respect to the clawback of all the tax benefits obtained under the EPR program for tax years 2012 to 2014. This income tax provision did not have any cash impact because the Company had net operating losses (NOLs) available to deduct against the incremental taxable profit. The fact that the Belgium NOLs were utilized to offset the EPR clawback means they are no longer available to reduce our future cash tax rate and the amount of tax WABCO pays in Belgium is likely to increase significantly in future years which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSee Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company\u2019s appeal against the Decision and the impact on the Company's financial results in 2017.\nOur annual effective tax rate may increase, perhaps significantly in future years, if the European Commission decides that the Belgian Patent Income Deduction (PID) program is incompatible with European State Aid rules.\nIn July 2016, WABCO received a ruling from the Belgium Government confirming that it may claim a PID tax relief from 2015. Under current Belgium law, WABCO should be able to qualify for the PID until July 2021. There can be no guarantee that the European Commission will not later decide that the PID program in Belgium, like the EPR program, constitutes illegal state aid. If we lose the benefit of the PID program, it would increase our effective tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company\u2019s ability to claim PID relief.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $135.8 million in net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets include post-retirement and other employee benefits and net operating loss carryovers that can be used to offset taxable income in future\nperiods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is insufficient evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to record or further adjust a valuation allowance to revalue our deferred tax assets. Such a revaluation could result in material non-cash expense in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of tax liabilities arising from tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our overall effective tax rate and our results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in all major countries that it does business. While the Company believes it complies with all local country tax laws, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. Although the Company believes its tax estimates and reserves are adequate for all uncertain tax positions, if the results of an audit or litigation are different from the amounts accrued it could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which the determination is made. We adjust the estimates and reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or a court decision.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result of the Company no longer meeting the requirements for certain tax rulings it has been granted.\nWABCO has received a number of tax rulings and incentives in countries in which it is carrying out significant operations. If these incentives are revoked or if the Company no longer complies with the tax incentive requirements, it may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s global effective tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to general risks associated with our foreign operations.\nIn addition to the currency exchange risks inherent in operating in many different foreign countries, there are other risks inherent in our international operations.\nThe risks related to our foreign operations that we more often face in the normal course of business include:\n\u2022\nincreases in non-U.S. tax rates and the amount of non-U.S. earnings relative to total combined earnings could change and impact our combined tax rate;\n\u2022\nforeign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, price or exchange controls, or other restrictions;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas and customs duties and tariffs);\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with United States law, and the uncertainty created by this legal environment could limit our ability to effectively enforce our rights in certain markets; and\n\u2022\nin several of the countries in which we do business, we rely upon the ongoing performance of our joint venture partners who bear risks similar to our risks and also may include obligations they have under related shareholders' agreements and risk of being denied access to the capital markets which could lead to resource demands on the Company in order to maintain or advance its strategy.\nThe ability to manage these risks could be difficult and may limit our operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products internationally more difficult, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIncreasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total debt balance was $1.4 billion compared to $959.1 million as of our prior fiscal year end. Our indebtedness could affect our business and financial condition in various ways, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our interest expense under our revolving credit facilities or other variable-rate borrowing if interest rates were to rise; and\n\u2022\npotentially limiting our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms, or at all.\nWhile we believe we will have the ability to service our debt, respect all of the covenants contained in the facilities and obtain additional capital in the future if and when needed, that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and other factors that may be beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional capital in the future on favorable terms, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges in factors that impact the determination of our non-U.S. pension liabilities may adversely affect us.\nCertain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans, which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service. The Company\u2019s pension expense and its required contributions to its pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions the Company uses to measure its defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value and the inflation rate. The Company could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of its pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in its assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets. The Company could also experience increased other post-retirement expense due to decreases in the discount rate, increases in the health care trend rate and changes in demographics. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe purchase components and parts containing base metals and other commodities. If we are unable to obtain such components and parts or obtain them at reasonable price levels due to fluctuations in the costs of the underlying raw materials, our ability to maintain existing sales margins may be affected.\nWe purchase a broad range of materials and components and parts throughout the world in connection with our manufacturing activities. Major items include electronic components and parts containing aluminum, steel, copper, zinc, rubber and plastics. The cost of components and parts, which reflect the cost of the raw materials used therein, represents a significant portion of our total costs. Price increases of the underlying commodities may adversely affect our results of operations. Although we maintain alternative sources for components and parts, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials to our suppliers. The sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components or to do so at reasonable prices could have a temporary adverse effect on our production of certain products or the cost at which we can produce those products. In addition, any change in the supply or price of raw materials could materially adversely affect our future business and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain good relations with our employees, we could suffer work stoppages that could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nEmployees located in our sites in Europe, Asia and South America are subject to collective bargaining, with internal company agreements or external agreements at the region or country level. Currently approximately 50% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. These employees' right to strike is typically protected by law and union membership is confidential information which does not have to be provided to the employer. Our U.S. facilities are non-union. Any disputes with our employee base could result in work stoppages or labor protests, which could disrupt our operations. Any such labor disputes could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key customers.\nWe rely on several key customers. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, sales to our top ten customers accounted for approximately 44% of our sales. Many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and, as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays or cancellations. As a result of dependence on our key customers, we have experienced and could experience in the future a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if any of the following were to occur:\n\u2022\nthe loss of any key customer, in whole or in part;\n\u2022\na declining market in which customers reduce orders or demand reduced prices; or\n\u2022\na strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both its suppliers and customers.\nWe are subject to price reduction demands from our OEM customers. These price reductions could adversely affect the results of our operations\nDownward pricing pressure is a characteristic of the automotive industry, and as with other suppliers to commercial vehicle OEMs, we continue to experience price reduction demands from our customers. In the face of lower prices to customers, we must reduce our operating costs in order to maintain profitability. Whilst we have successfully implemented cost reduction initiatives, we anticipate our customers will continue to pursue aggressive pricing strategies. Customers may also request that we pay for design, engineering and tooling costs that are incurred prior to the start of production and recover these costs through amortization in the price per unit of the applicable component. If the Company is unable to offset customer price reductions through improved operating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives, technology enhancements and other initiatives, if a given program is not launched or is launched with significantly lower volumes than planned, or if we are unable to avoid price reductions from our customers, the results of our operations could be adversely affected.\nIf there are changes in the environmental or other regulations that affect one or more of our current or future products, it could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to various environmental and other regulations in the U.S. and internationally. Risk of environmental liability is inherent in our current and former manufacturing activities. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of any hazardous substance contamination at our past and present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites and could also be held liable for damages to natural resources and any consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other environmental damage. While we have a number of proactive programs underway to minimize the impact of the production and use of our products on the environment and believe that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict whether there will be changes in the environmental regulations affecting our products.\nAny changes in the environmental and other regulations which affect our current or future products could have a negative impact on our business if we are unable to adjust our product offering to comply with such regulatory changes. In addition, it is possible that we will incur increased costs as a result of complying with environmental regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to product liability, warranty and recall claims, which may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims if our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, whether or not due to defective supplier parts, or the use of our products results, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. While we maintain reasonable limits of insurance coverage to appropriately respond to such exposures, large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We may incur significant costs to defend these claims and may not be able to recover related costs from suppliers. We may also experience any product liability losses in the future. In addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in recalls and exchanges of such products. In the past five years, our warranty expense has fluctuated between approximately 0.8% and 1.1% of sales on an annual basis. Individual quarters were above or below the annual averages. The future cost associated with providing product warranties and/or bearing the cost of repair or replacement of our products could exceed our historical experience and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to plan our capacity well in advance of production and our success depends on having available capacity and effectively using it.\nWe principally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of our customers' new products. Our customers' new product development generally begins significantly prior to the marketing and production of their new products and our supply of our products generally lasts for the life of our customers' products. Nevertheless, our customers may move business to other suppliers or request price reductions during the life cycle of a product. The long development and sales cycle of our new products, combined with the specialized nature of many of our facilities and the resulting difficulty in shifting work from one facility to another, could result in variances in capacity utilization. In order to meet our customers' requirements, we may be required to\nsupply our customers regardless of the actual cost to us and consequently we may suffer an adverse impact on our operating profit margins and results of operations.\nWe must continue to make technological advances, or we may not be able to successfully compete in our industry.\nWe operate in an industry in which technological advancements are necessary to remain competitive. Accordingly, we devote substantial resources and collaborate with technology development partners to improve already technologically complex products and to remain a leader in technological innovation. However, if we fail to continue to make technological improvements or our competitors develop technologically superior products, it could have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nA disruption in our information technology systems including one related to cyber security could pose a risk to the security of our systems, products and services and could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite our efforts to protect data or information, our products, services, and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to failures, security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors. A system failure, security breach or error could result in:\n\u2022\nthe unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information;\n\u2022\nthe compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, including our intellectual property or trade secrets;\n\u2022\nthe improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks; and\n\u2022\nproduction downtimes and operational disruptions.\nWe may incur significant costs related to the threat of any unauthorized access to or malfunction of our systems, products or services, including but not limited to, costs of protecting our products and systems. To the extent that data is inappropriately used or disclosed, lost, modified or destroyed, our business may be interrupted and we may incur significant costs, fines or penalties related to defective products, regulatory investigations, and litigation. Our reputation and brand names could be materially damaged by the threat or perpetration of cyber crime and the sales of our products and services may decrease. Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in executing and integrating acquisitions into our operations, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe routinely evaluate potential acquisitions and may pursue acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material to our business. We cannot provide assurance whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. We may encounter various risks in any acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\nthe possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nloss of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated problems or liabilities; and\n\u2022\nincreased labor and regulatory compliance costs of acquired businesses.\nSome or all of those risks could impair our results of operations and impact our financial condition. We may finance any future acquisitions from internally generated funds, bank borrowings, public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.\nAcquisitions may also require us to increase our borrowings under our bank credit facilities or other debt instruments, or to seek new sources of liquidity. Increased borrowings would correspondingly increase our financial leverage, and could result in lower credit ratings and increased future borrowing costs. These risks could also reduce our flexibility to respond to changes in the industry or in general economic conditions. If we are unable to identify or execute on appropriate opportunities for acquisition, investment or growth, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, is currently unable to inspect the audit work and practices of auditors operating in Belgium, including our auditor.\nOur auditors, Ernst & Young Bedrijfsrevisoren BCVBA/Reviseurs d'Entreprises SCCRL, are registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Our auditors, like any other independent registered public accounting firms operating in Belgium, are not yet permitted, because of Belgian regulation impediments, to be subject to inspections by the PCAOB that assess their compliance with U.S. law and professional standards in connection with performance of audits of financial statements filed with the SEC. As a result, our investors may not realize the potential benefits of such inspections.\nRisks Relating to the Separation\nWe are responsible for certain of Trane's contingent and other corporate liabilities.\nUnder the Indemnification and Cooperation Agreement, the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary WABCO Europe BVBA has assumed and is responsible for certain contingent liabilities related to Trane's business (including certain associated costs and expenses, whether arising prior to, at or after the Distribution) and will indemnify Trane for these liabilities. Among the contingent liabilities against which we will indemnify Trane and the other indemnities, are liabilities associated with certain non-U.S. tax liabilities and certain U.S. and non-U.S. environmental liabilities associated with certain Trane entities.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nYour percentage ownership in WABCO may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in WABCO may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that have already been granted and that we expect will be granted to our directors and officers in the future under our Omnibus Incentive Plan. In addition, we may in the future issue additional equity securities in order to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and product development, or to make acquisitions and other investments, which may dilute your ownership interest.\nWe cannot assure you that we will repurchase shares or pay any dividends.\nWhile we have historically returned value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and/or dividends, our ability to repurchase shares and pay dividends is limited by available cash, contingent liabilities and surplus. Moreover, all decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends and share repurchases will be at the sole discretion of our Board and will be evaluated from time to time in light of our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and certain provisions of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\na Board of Directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nelimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nDelaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may\nbe considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of our shareholders and our company.", "PERMNO": 92188, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "WBC"}
