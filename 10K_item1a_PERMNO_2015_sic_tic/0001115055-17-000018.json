{"cik": "1115055", "company": "PINNACLE FINANCIAL PARTNERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to our company, our industry and our market areas. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be materially and negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline in future periods.\nIf the federal funds and interbank funding rates remain at current extremely low levels, our net interest margin, and consequently our net earnings, may be negatively impacted.\nBecause of significant competitive pressures in our market and the negative impact of these pressures on our deposit and loan pricing, coupled with the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio has variable rate pricing that moves in concert with changes to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' federal funds rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (both of which are at extremely low levels as a result of current economic conditions), our net interest margin may be negatively impacted if these rates remain at their extremely low levels. In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors raised the target range for the federal funds rate from 0.25% to 0.50% to 0.50% to 0.75%. As interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience \"gaps\" in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings) will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities), or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \"gap\" may work against us, and our earnings may be negatively affected. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of variable rate loans with interest rate floors as a percentage of total loans was approximately 18.4%. During 2015 and 2016, in anticipation of expected increases in short term interest rates, we reduced the amount of variable rate loans with interest rate floors as a percentage of total loans to 9.7% at December 31, 2015 and to 5.6% at December 31, 2016. We believe that the reduction in the amount of variable rate loans with interest rate floors should better position our balance sheet for a rising rate environment. In the event that short-term interest rates don't continue to rise in 2017, or those rates rise more slowly than we are anticipating, our efforts to transition our balance sheet to a more asset sensitive position may negatively impact our results of operations as we may earn less interest on these loans than we would have had we maintained these loan floors.\nThe absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates may affect our level of interest income, the primary component of our gross revenue, as well as the level of our interest expense. Interest rate fluctuations are caused by many factors which, for the most part, are not under our control. For example, national monetary policy plays a significant role in the determination of interest rates. Additionally, competitor pricing and the resulting negotiations that occur with our customers also impact the rates we collect on loans and the rates we pay on deposits.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses. Because we continue to have a significant number of loans with interest rate floors above current rates, in a rising rate environment our liabilities may reprice faster than our loans, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps, which are designed to lessen elements of our interest rate exposure. In the event that interest rates do not change in the manner anticipated, such transactions may not be beneficial in managing the interest rate risk.\nWe have a concentration of credit exposure to borrowers in certain industries, and we also target small to medium-sized businesses.\nWe have meaningful credit exposures to borrowers in certain businesses, including commercial and residential building lessors, new home builders, and land subdividers. These industries experienced adversity during 2008 through 2010 as a result of sluggish economic conditions, and, as a result, an increased level of borrowers in these industries were unable to perform under their loan agreements with us, or suffered loan downgrades which negatively impacted our results of operations. If the economic environment in our markets weakens in 2017 or beyond, these industry concentrations could result in increased deterioration in credit quality, past dues, loan charge offs and collateral value declines, which could cause our earnings to be negatively impacted. Furthermore, any of our large credit exposures that deteriorate unexpectedly could cause us to have to make significant additional loan loss provisions, negatively impacting our earnings.\nA substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market areas. As a result, a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans primarily to small to medium-sized businesses. At December 31, 2016, our commercial and industrial loans accounted for almost 34.2% of our total loans, up from 34.1% at December 31, 2015. Additionally, approximately, 16.0% of our total loans at December 31, 2016 are owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, which are loans to businesses secured by the businesses' real estate. We expect to seek to expand the amount of such loans in our portfolio in 2017, including as a result of our proposed acquisition of BNC. During periods of lower economic growth like those we have experienced in recent years, small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of such businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of our acquisitions of Avenue, Magna, and CapitalMark over the last eighteen months, and our strong organic growth in our legacy markets, our level of commercial real estate loans has increased markedly from approximately 190% of risk-based capital as of December 31, 2014 to approximately 256% of risk-based capital as of December 31, 2016. The proposed merger with BNC will further increase our amount of these types of loans. Though we currently operate within the federal banking regulatory agencies' guidelines on the amount of these types of loans that a bank is encouraged to hold, and we don't anticipate exceeding these levels for a material length of time, there may be short-term periods when our levels of these loans exceed these guidelines, including following the consummation of the merger with BNC.\nThe percentage of real estate construction and development loans in Pinnacle Bank's portfolio was approximately 10.8% of total loans at December 31, 2016. These loans make up approximately 24.0% of our non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. This type of lending is generally considered to have relatively high credit risks because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful completion and operation of the related real estate project. Weakness in residential real estate market prices as well as demand could result in price reductions in home and land values adversely affecting the value of collateral securing the construction and development loans that we hold. Should we experience the return of these adverse economic and real estate market conditions we may again experience increases in non-performing loans and other real estate owned, increased losses and expenses from the management and disposition of non-performing assets, increases in provision for loan losses, and increases in operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of loans, all of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite recent acquisitions we have made, we remain principally geographically concentrated in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability.\nPrior to our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, we operated primarily in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and most of our borrowers, depositors and other customers lived or had operations in these areas. With our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, we have increased our presence in the Knoxville MSA and expanded our operations into the Chattanooga, Tennessee - Georgia MSA and surrounding counties and the Memphis, Tennessee - Mississippi - Arkansas MSA, but the significant majority of our borrowers remain situated in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and our recent acquisition of Avenue has further increased the number of borrowers we have in the Nashville, Tennessee MSA. Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets (particularly the Nashville, Tennessee MSA), along with the continued attraction of business ventures to these areas, and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in these markets. We cannot assure you that economic conditions, including loan demand, in our markets will not deteriorate during 2017 or thereafter, and upon any deterioration, we may not be able to grow our loan portfolio in line with our expectations, the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us may be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIn connection with our proposed merger with BNC, we have agreed to acquire a bank with branches in select markets in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which if consummated will provide additional geographic diversity. Nonetheless, compared to national financial institutions, even following consummation of the merger, we will be less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or continuation of more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nOur acquisitions and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nIn 2015, we completed the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, and in 2016, we completed the acquisition of Avenue. On January 22, 2017, we announced the signing of the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) a wholly owned subsidiary of Pinnacle Financial will merge with and into BNC, with BNC surviving the merger and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger and as a part of a single integrated transaction, we will cause BNC to merge with and into Pinnacle Financial, with Pinnacle Financial surviving the Merger. Bank of North Carolina, BNC's wholly owned bank subsidiary, and Pinnacle Bank will likewise merge if that transaction is consummated. We currently expect to consummate the Merger in the third quarter of 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. In addition to our proposed expansion into Virginia and the Carolinas, we expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in select high-growth markets located outside of Tennessee in the southeastern portion of the United States through additional branches and also may consider expansion within these markets through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including:\nManagement of Growth. We may be unable to successfully:\n\uf0b7\nmaintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\uf0b7\nidentify and expand into suitable markets;\n\uf0b7\nobtain regulatory and other approvals;\n\uf0b7\nidentify and acquire suitable sites for new banking offices;\n\uf0b7\nattract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\uf0b7\nmaintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\uf0b7\navoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of the acquired institution;\n\uf0b7\nmaintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth;\n\uf0b7\nmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\uf0b7\nimplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nOperating Results. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets.\nDevelopment of Offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The same is true for our efforts to expand in these markets with the hiring of additional seasoned professionals with significant experience in that market. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our new branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired, as the case may be.\nRegulatory and Economic Factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals (including those necessary to consummate the merger with BNC), changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering our expected markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover losses inherent in our portfolio, our earnings will decrease.\nIf loan customers with significant loan balances fail to repay their loans, our earnings and capital levels will suffer. We make various assumptions and judgments about the probable losses in our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of any collateral securing the loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to cover our estimate of the probable losses in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of this allowance, we utilize estimates based on analyses of volume and types of loans, internal loan classifications, trends in classifications, volume and trends in delinquencies, nonaccruals and charge-offs, loss experience of various loan categories, national and local economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications, and other pertinent factors and information. If our assumptions are inaccurate, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover potential loan losses, and additional provisions may be necessary which would decrease our earnings.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs. Their conclusions about the quality of a particular borrower or our entire loan portfolio may be different than ours. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans (including those we acquired in our recently completed acquisitions and those we expect to acquire as a result of our merger with BNC) identification of additional problem loans, accounting rule changes (like those related to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's rules regarding accounting for current expected credit losses) and other factors, both within and outside of our management's control. These additions may require increased provision expense which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we recently acquired and BNC or to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nWe are still in the process of integrating the businesses we recently acquired, and, upon consummation of the Merger, will begin the process of integrating BNC. A successful integration of these businesses with ours will depend substantially on our ability to consolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may not be able to combine our business with the businesses we recently acquired and with the business of BNC without encountering difficulties, such as:\n\uf0b7\nthe loss of key employees;\n\uf0b7\nthe disruption of operations and business;\n\uf0b7\ninability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n\uf0b7\nloan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss;\n\uf0b7\npossible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n\uf0b7\nunexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; and/or\n\uf0b7\nproblems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from regular banking operations.\nAdditionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of these businesses and BNC.\nFurther, we acquired these businesses, and have entered into the merger agreement to acquire BNC, with the expectation that these acquisitions will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technological efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate the acquired businesses and BNC in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits on the anticipated timeframe, or at all, could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, we made fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording these acquisitions, and, upon consummation of the merger with BNC, will make such estimates in recording such acquisition. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nThe combined company following the BNC merger will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.\nWe expect to incur significant costs associated with combining the operations of BNC with our operations. We just recently began collecting information in order to formulate detailed integration plans to deliver anticipated cost savings. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the business of BNC. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWhether or not the Merger is consummated, we will incur substantial expenses, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, in pursuing the Merger which will adversely impact our earnings. Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of all required governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including approval by certain federal and state banking regulators. We and BNC intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained on the anticipated timeframe, or at all.\nFailure to complete the Merger could cause our results to be adversely affected, our stock price to decline or have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, our stock price may decline because costs related to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed. Moreover, if BNC terminates the Merger Agreement because our board of directors withdraws or modifies or qualifies its recommendation that our shareholders vote in favor of our issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $66.0 million to BNC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, whether because of our failure to receive required regulatory approvals in a timely fashion or because one of the parties has breached its obligations in a way that permits BNC to terminate the Merger Agreement, or for any other reason, our stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nOur proposed merger with BNC involves risks unlike those we have faced in connection with our other recent acquisitions.\nSince January 1, 2015, we have acquired three financial institutions with aggregate total assets of approximately $2.93 billion as of the respective dates we consummated those acquisitions. BNC's total assets as of December 31, 2016 are approximately $7.402 billion, and accordingly BNC's total assets significantly exceed the aggregate total assets of all of these financial institutions combined. For the Merger to be successful, we will need to, among other things, successfully export our business strategies to the new markets in which BNC operates and effectively manage a combined company that is over 50% larger than our present size, measured by total assets. Moreover, all of our acquisitions to date have been of financial institutions headquartered in Tennessee with significant operations in markets with which we were familiar. BNC operates 76 banking offices across three states in many markets that are unfamiliar to us. We will rely heavily on BNC's existing personnel to grow loan and deposit balances in those markets and if we are unable to retain BNC's key employees our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, BNC's loan portfolio is made up of a greater percentage of commercial real estate loans than we have in our portfolio and BNC is more dependent on noncore funding than we are. Our regulators will be closely monitoring the levels of commercial real estate loans in our portfolio following the closing of the Merger and, if we are unable to originate a significant amount of loans in other segments of our portfolio or increase our capital levels in amounts sufficient to keep our concentration of these commercial real estate loans below regulatory guidelines, our ability to continue to aggressively grow our balance sheet may be negatively affected and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are not able to increase the amount of core funding in these markets, particularly in lower cost deposits, our net interest margin and liquidity may be adversely affected which could result in a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIn order to consummate the Merger, and the Merger of Pinnacle Bank with the Bank of North Carolina we will be required to receive certain regulatory approvals. While we have been able to promptly secure the required regulatory approvals for our recently completed acquisitions, the complexity, size and geographic scope of our proposed Merger with BNC may result in these required regulatory approvals being granted more slowly or not at all. If we are unable to secure the required regulatory approvals to consummate the Merger as quickly as we have in other transactions, or at all, our ability to achieve the synergies and cost savings that we have estimated we can achieve in this transaction may be delayed and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, a delay in receiving any required regulatory approvals may cause our stock price to decline. Moreover, as a condition to their approval of the Merger with BNC, certain regulators may require us to increase our capital levels or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of the acquisition. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the Merger or materially reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and could adversely affect our ability to integrate BNC with our operations and/or reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits of the transaction. This could result in a failure to consummate the transactions or have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions (as we have aggressively done recently), we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above, in general acquiring other banks, businesses or branches, particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\uf0b7\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\uf0b7\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\uf0b7\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, including as a result of de novo expansion into a market, and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the significant costs of the expansion that we may incur, particularly in the first 12 to 24 months of operations;\n\uf0b7\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\uf0b7\nthe diversion of our management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n\uf0b7\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\uf0b7\nentry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\uf0b7\nclosing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by our shareholders or shareholders of companies we may seek to acquire;\n\uf0b7\nthe inability to receive regulatory approvals timely or at all, or such approvals being restrictively conditional; and\n\uf0b7\nrisks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets as well as other markets throughout the southeastern portion of the United States and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which may have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities, particularly in our targeted high-growth markets located outside of Tennessee. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing our pending or any potential future acquisitions.\nImplementation of the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act includes, among other things, (i) the creation of a Financial Services Oversight Counsel to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; (ii) the elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the transfer of oversight of federally chartered thrift institutions and their holding companies to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve; (iii) the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products that would affect banks and non-bank finance companies; (iv) the establishment of new capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies; (v) enhanced regulation of financial markets, including the derivatives, securitization and mortgage origination markets; (vi) the elimination of certain proprietary trading and private equity investment activities by banks; (vii) the elimination of barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks; (viii) a permanent increase of FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000; (ix) the authorization of interest-bearing transaction accounts; and (x) changes in how the FDIC deposit insurance assessments are calculated and an increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nCertain provisions of the legislation were not immediately effective or are subject to required studies and implementing regulations. Further, community banks with less than $10 billion in assets are exempt from certain provisions of the legislation. We exceeded $10 billion in assets upon the consummation of the Avenue merger, causing us to become subject to these additional regulations, and, as described below, our results of operations may be materially impacted by the additional costs to comply with these additional regulations as well as the higher costs associated with increased deposit insurance premiums.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing requirements. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Previously, Pinnacle Bank was subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the FDIC was primarily responsible for examining our compliance with consumer protection laws and those CFPB regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is uncertainty as to how the CFPB's examination and regulatory authority might impact our business.\nSince we have exceeded $10 billion in assets, we will now be required, under the Dodd-Frank Act, to submit annually a stress test to the Federal Reserve that projects our performance in various economic scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve. We are required to submit our first stress test in the third quarter of 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are forward-looking exercises conducted by the Federal Reserve and financial companies regulated by the Federal Reserve to help ensure institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during adverse economic conditions. In performing these stress tests, we will be required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable. The outcome of the Federal Reserve's analysis of our projected performance (to include capital, earnings, and balance sheet changes) will be used in supervision of us and will assist the Federal Reserve in assessing our risk profile and capital adequacy. The results of any stress test that we perform could hinder our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends to shareholders as has been our practice, and could also impact decisions made by the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators regarding future acquisitions or investments by us or Pinnacle Bank.\nIn addition, beginning on July 1, 2017 we will become subject to the Durbin Amendment promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Durbin Amendment, interchange fees for debit card transactions are capped at $0.21 plus five basis points. This limitation on interchange fees will adversely impact our results of operations. Had the Dodd-Frank Act been effective for Pinnacle Financial on July 1, 2016, the Durbin Amendment would have reduced interchange income by $3.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016.\nCompliance with these requirements that are now applicable to us since we have exceeded $10 billion in total assets may necessitate that we hire or contract with additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities.\nAlthough many of regulations implementing portions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been promulgated, we are still unable to predict how this significant legislation may be interpreted and enforced or the full extent to which implementing regulations and supervisory policies may affect us. Finally, President Donald Trump and the Congressional majority have indicated that the Dodd-Frank Act will be under further scrutiny and some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules promulgated thereunder may be revised, repealed or amended. There can be no assurance that these or future reforms will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative developments in the U.S. and local economy may adversely impact our results in the future.\nEconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate deteriorated significantly between early 2008 and the middle of 2010. These challenges manifested themselves primarily in the form of increased levels of provisions for loan losses and other real estate expense related to declining collateral values in our real estate loan portfolio and increased costs associated with our portfolio of other real estate owned. Although economic conditions appear to have stabilized and strengthened in our markets in the more recent periods and we have refocused our efforts on growing our earning assets, we believe that we will continue to experience an uncertain economic environment during 2017. Accordingly, we expect that our results of operations could be negatively impacted by economic conditions, including reduced loan demand. There can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry, and the capital, credit and real estate markets, generally, or us in particular, will improve materially, or at all, in the near future, or thereafter, in which case we could experience reduced earnings or again experience significant losses and write-downs of assets, and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nWhile our board of directors has approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock since the fourth quarter of 2013, there can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be dividends that we receive from Pinnacle Bank. Although Pinnacle Bank's asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from Pinnacle Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay and that Pinnacle Bank may declare and pay to us. For example, Federal Reserve Board regulations implementing the capital rules required under Basel III do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers that began to apply on January 1, 2016 and are being phased in over three years.\nIn addition, the terms of (i) the indenture pursuant to which our subordinated debentures have been issued, (ii) the subordinated notes we assumed upon consummation of the Avenue merger, and the (iii) subordinated debentures and subordinated notes we will assume upon the consummation of the merger with BNC, prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock at times when we are deferring the payment of interest on such subordinated debentures or subordinated notes. Moreover, the terms of the loan agreement for Pinnacle Financial's line of credit prohibits us from paying dividends when there is an event of default existing under the loan agreement, or the payment of a dividend would cause an event of default.\nOur ability to grow our loan portfolio may be limited by, among other things, economic conditions, competition within our market areas, the timing of loan repayments and seasonality.\nOur ability to continue to improve our operating results is dependent upon, among other things, aggressively growing our loan portfolio. While we believe that our strategy to grow our loan portfolio is sound and our growth targets are achievable over an extended period of time, competition within our market areas is significant, particularly for borrowers whose businesses have been less negatively impacted by the challenging economic conditions of the last few years. We compete with both large regional and national financial institutions, who are sometimes able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose to offer, and smaller community-based financial institutions who seek to offer a similar level of service to that which we offer. This competition can make loan growth challenging, particularly if we are unwilling to price loans at levels that would cause unacceptable levels of compression of our net interest margin or if we are unwilling to structure a loan in a manner that we believe results in a level of risk to us that we are not willing to accept. Moreover, loan growth throughout the year can fluctuate due in part to seasonality of the businesses of our borrowers and potential borrowers and the timing on loan repayments, particularly those of our borrowers with significant relationships with us, resulting from, among other things, excess levels of liquidity.\nOur investment in BHG may not produce the contribution to our results of operations that we expect.\nPinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank collectively hold a 49% interest in BHG. While we have a significant stake in BHG, are entitled to designate two members of BHG's five person board of managers and in some instances have protective rights to block BHG from engaging in certain activities, including, until March 1, 2020, a sale of BHG (following March 1, 2020, the other managers can approve a sale of BHG without our consent), the other managers and members of BHG may make most decisions regarding BHG's operations without our consent or approval. Any sale of all or a portion of our interest in BHG would adversely affect our noninterest income. Moreover, there are certain limitations on our ability to sell our interest in BHG without first offering BHG and the other members a right of first refusal, and we are prohibited from transferring any portion of our interest without the consent of the other members of BHG prior to March 1, 2021, other than transfers in connection with an acquisition of Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank or as a result of a change in applicable law that forces us and/or Pinnacle Bank to divest our or Pinnacle Bank's ownership interests in BHG.\nA significant portion of BHG's revenue (and correspondingly our interest in any of BHG's net profits) comes from the sale of BHG originated loans to a network of approximately 400+ community banks. Moreover, the aggregate purchase price we paid to acquire our interest in BHG was based on our expectation that BHG will continue to grow its business and increase the amount of loans that it is able to originate and sell. In the event that BHG's loan growth slows over historical levels or its loan sales decrease (including but not limited to as a result of regulatory restrictions on banks that are the principal purchasers of BHG's loans), its results of operations and our non-interest income would be adversely affected. BHG currently operates in most states without the need for a permit or any other license. In the event that BHG was required to register or become licensed in any state in which it operates, or regulations are adopted that seek to limit BHG's ability to operate in any jurisdiction or that seek to limit the amounts of interest that BHG can charge on its loans, BHG's results of operations (and our and Pinnacle Bank's interest in BHG's net profits) could be materially and adversely affected.\nBHG's business may become subject to increased scrutiny by the FDIC or the Federal Reserve as it grows or as a result of our investment. The FDIC has published guidance related to the operation of marketplace lenders and banks' business relationships with such lenders and other third parties in which banks are required to exercise increased oversight and ongoing monitoring and other responsibility for such third parties' compliance with applicable regulatory guidance and requirements. As a result, we are subject to enhanced responsibility for and risk related to BHG and our relationship with it. BHG's compliance costs may increase and its loan yields may be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact its results of operations and our and Pinnacle Bank's interest in BHG's net profits. If banks that are examined by the FDIC became restricted in their ability to buy loans originated by BHG, BHG's business would be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our interest in BHG's profits.\nChanges to requirements for bank holding companies and depository institutions that became effective January 1, 2015 and continue to be phased in may negatively impact Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's results of operations.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The final rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The final rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Moreover, these rules refine the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The minimum capital level requirements now applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% (being phased in over three years beginning January 1, 2016) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement was being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets in 2016 and will increase by a like amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. We will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if our capital levels fall below these minimums plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nUnder these rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets at that date, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. If we consummate the Merger, we expect that our total assets will exceed $15.0 billion, which, as a result of exceeding that level as a result of a merger, would cause the subordinated debentures we and BNC have issued in connection with prior trust preferred securities offerings to cease to qualify as Tier 1 capital under applicable banking regulations and we may need to increase the level of Tier 1 capital we maintain through issuances of common stock or noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which could cause dilution to our existing common shareholders. Though these trust preferred securities would no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital from and after the closing of the Merger, we believe they would continue to qualify as Tier 2 capital. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.\nThe final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank opted-out of this requirement.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank, like those adopted to implement the Basel III reforms, could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, like the shares of common stock we offered in January 2017 and the subordinated notes recently issued by Pinnacle Financial, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nImplementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back shares.\nOur ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions.\nFederal and state bank regulators require Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support operations. At December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's regulatory capital ratios were at \"well-capitalized\" levels under regulatory guidelines. However, as described above, our business strategy calls for continued growth in our existing banking markets and targeted expansion in new markets. Growth in assets at rates in excess of the rate at which our capital is increased through retained earnings will reduce our capital ratios unless we continue to increase capital. Failure by us to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities and would negatively impact our ability to pursue acquisitions or other expansion opportunities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to maintain capital levels, sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions. Pinnacle Bank is required to obtain regulatory approval in order to pay dividends to Pinnacle Financial unless the amount of such dividends does not exceed its net income for that calendar year plus retained net income for the preceding two years. Any restriction on the ability of Pinnacle Bank to pay dividends to Pinnacle Financial could impact Pinnacle Financial's ability to continue to pay dividends on its common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that access to capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and/or debt and, in turn, our liquidity. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to expand through internal growth or acquisitions or to continue operations could be impaired.\nCertain of our deposits and other funding sources may be volatile and impact our liquidity.\nIn addition to the traditional core deposits, such as demand deposit accounts, interest checking, money market savings and certificates of deposits less than $250,000, we utilize or in the past have utilized several noncore funding sources, such as brokered certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Cincinnati advances, federal funds purchased and other sources. We utilize these noncore funding sources to fund the ongoing operations and growth of Pinnacle Bank. The availability of these noncore funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions, in some instances regulation, and to investor assessment of our financial strength and, as such, the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly and/or the availability of such funds may be restricted, thus impacting our net interest income, our immediate liquidity and/or our access to additional liquidity. We have somewhat similar risks to the extent high balance core deposits exceed the amount of deposit insurance coverage available.\nWe impose certain internal limits as to the absolute level of noncore funding we will incur at any point in time. Should we exceed those limitations, we may need to modify our growth plans, liquidate certain assets, participate loans to correspondents or execute other actions to allow for us to return to an acceptable level of noncore funding within a reasonable amount of time.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. We provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nIn addition, we outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are able to consummate the Merger, we will face similar risks with respect to BNC's computer systems and networks. We will have to analyze those systems to determine what protective measures are necessary, if any, to strengthen their systems. We may incur significant costs to upgrade their systems and networks and these costs may adversely affect our results of operations.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, Pinnacle Bank may acquire, through foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased which are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we, or Pinnacle Bank, might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNational or state legislation or regulation may increase our expenses and reduce earnings.\nBank regulators are increasing regulatory scrutiny, and additional restrictions (including those originating from the Dodd-Frank Act) on financial institutions have been proposed or adopted by regulators and by Congress. Changes in tax law, federal legislation, regulation or policies, such as bankruptcy laws, deposit insurance, consumer protection laws, and capital requirements, among others, can result in significant increases in our expenses and/or charge-offs, which may adversely affect our earnings. Changes in state or federal tax laws or regulations can have a similar impact. State and municipal governments, including the State of Tennessee, could seek to increase their tax revenues through increased tax levies which could have a meaningful impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, financial institution regulatory agencies are expected to continue to be aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the continued issuance of additional formal or informal enforcement or supervisory actions. These actions, whether formal or informal, could result in our agreeing to limitations or to take actions that limit our operational flexibility, restrict our growth or increase our capital or liquidity levels. Failure to comply with any formal or informal regulatory restrictions, including informal supervisory actions, could lead to further regulatory enforcement actions. Negative developments in the financial services industry and the impact of recently enacted or new legislation in response to those developments could negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, industry, legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction, capital strategies, compensation or operating plans.\nA decline in our stock price or expected future cash flows, or a material adverse change in our results of operations or prospects, could result in impairment of our goodwill.\nA significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization below book value, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of our goodwill. At December 31, 2016, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets totaled approximately $566.7 million, and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed BNC merger and our recent public offering of common stock, would have been approximately $1.75 billion. If we were to conclude that a write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then the appropriate charge would likely cause a material loss. Any significant loss would further adversely impact the capacity of Pinnacle Bank to pay dividends to us without seeking prior regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our ability to pay required interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nCompetition with other banking institutions could adversely affect our profitability.\nA number of banking institutions in our geographic markets have higher lending limits, more banking offices, and a larger market share of loans or deposits than we do. In addition, our asset management division competes with numerous brokerage firms and mutual fund companies which are also much larger. In some respects, this may place these competitors in a competitive advantage. This competition may limit or reduce our profitability, reduce our growth and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services in the Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis and Chattanooga markets. Moreover, much of our organic loan growth in 2012 through 2016 was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. Inability to retain these key personnel (including key personnel of the businesses we have acquired and BNC, if the Merger is consummated) or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals' skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them. Moreover, the higher costs we have to pay to hire and retain these experienced individuals could cause our noninterest expense levels to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.\nWe are from time to time subject to certain litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We may also be subject to claims related to our loan servicing programs, particularly those involving servicing of commercial real estate loans. These claims and legal actions, as well as supervisory actions by our regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of other regulatory agencies with which we deal, including those with oversight of our loan servicing programs, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. The outcome of these cases is uncertain. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our or Pinnacle Bank's capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, we may issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. We may sell these shares at prices below the current market price of shares, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute shareholder ownership. We could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions such as BNC or investments in fee-related businesses such as BHG, which would also dilute shareholder ownership.\nHolders of Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's indebtedness and junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of Pinnacle Financial's shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2016, Pinnacle Financial had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $82.5 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by Pinnacle Financial, and the accompanying subordinated debentures are senior to shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock. As a result, Pinnacle Financial must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on common stock and, in the event of Pinnacle Financial's bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on Pinnacle Financial's common stock. Pinnacle Financial has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock. If our financial condition deteriorates or if we do not receive required regulatory approvals, we may be required to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures. Upon consummation of the Merger with BNC, Pinnacle Financial will assume $50.5 million in outstanding principal of junior subordinated debentures issued by certain of BNC's subsidiaries. Such subordinated debentures will similarly rank senior to shares of Pinnacle's common stock.\nFrom time to time, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank have issued, and in connection with the Avenue merger, assumed, subordinated notes. At December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $270.0 million of subordinated notes outstanding, not including the subordinated debentures issued in connection with our trust preferred securities. In addition, upon consummation of the Merger, we will assume $60.0 million of subordinated notes issued by BNC. The terms of these notes prohibit or will prohibit Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank, as applicable, from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on its common stock at any time when payment of interest on these notes has not been timely made and while any such accrued and unpaid interest remains unpaid. Moreover, the notes we have issued or assumed, and the notes issued by BNC that we will assume in connection with the Merger, rank, or will rank, senior to shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock. In the event of any bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of Pinnacle Financial, these notes, along with Pinnacle Financial's other indebtedness, would have to be repaid before Pinnacle Financial's shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Pinnacle Financial.\nPinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank may from time to time issue additional subordinated indebtedness that would have to be repaid before Pinnacle Financial's shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop, even after we consummate the Merger. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nOur business is dependent on technology, and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. We have made significant investments in data processing, management information systems and internet banking accessibility. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create additional efficiencies in our operations through the use of technology. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We cannot make assurances that our technological improvements will increase our operational efficiency or that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nWe are subject to various statutes and regulations that may impose additional costs or limit our ability to take certain actions.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged on loans, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capital requirements established by our regulators, which require us to maintain specified levels of capital. It is possible that our FDIC assessments may increase in the future. Any future assessment increases could negatively impact our results of operations. Significant changes in laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have been recently adopted and others are being considered in Congress. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.", "PERMNO": 89395, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PNFP"}
