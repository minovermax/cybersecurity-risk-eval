The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading ''Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements'' before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Merger with Tecogen and Tecogen.ADGE Acquisition Corp.\nOn November 1, 2016, ADGE entered into a Merger Agreement with Tecogen and Tecogen.ADGE Acquisition Corp. ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s obligations to effect the Merger are subject to certain conditions, including that the Merger be approved by a vote of ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s stockholders at separate special meeting of such stockholders. There is no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or waived or that ADGE's or Tecogen\u2019s stockholders will adopt the Merger Agreement.\nADGE's obligations and the obligations of Tecogen to complete the transaction are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. ADGE's obligations and the obligations of Tecogen are each subject to, among other conditions: (i) approval of the Merger by ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s stockholders, (ii) approval of the listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market of the shares of Tecogen common stock to be issued in the Merger, upon official notice of issuance, (iii) the effectiveness of Tecogen\u2019s Form S-4 registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (iv) the absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the transaction, (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by ADGE and Tecogen, subject to certain materiality qualifications, and (vi) the performance in all material respects of the material obligations required to be performed by ADGE and Tecogen at or prior to the Merger effective time.\nThe satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the completion of the transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the transaction could cause ADGE or Tecogen not to realize some or all of the benefits that ADGE or Tecogen expect to achieve if the transaction is successfully completed within its expected time frame. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the transaction will be completed.\nThe market price of Tecogen common stock after completion of the transaction will continue to fluctuate, and may be affected by factors different from those affecting shares of our common stock currently.\nUpon completion of the Merger, holders of ADGE's common stock will become holders of shares of Tecogen common stock. The market price of Tecogen\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly following consummation of the transaction and holders of ADGE's common stock could lose the value of their investment in Tecogen common stock. The issuance of shares of Tecogen common stock in the Merger could on its own have the effect of depressing the market price for Tecogen common stock. In addition, many of ADGE's stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of Tecogen common stock they receive as a result of the Merger. Other stockholders of ADGE, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of Tecogen common stock they receive as a result of the Merger. Such sales of Tecogen common stock may take place shortly following the completion of the transaction and could have the effect of depressing the market price for Tecogen common stock.\nMoreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the Tecogen common stock, regardless of Tecogen\u2019s actual operating performance.\nThe business of Tecogen differs from that of ADGE's in important respects, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Tecogen after the transaction, as well as the market price of Tecogen common stock, may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the results of ADGE's operations. Following the closing of the transaction, ADGE will be part of a larger company with other lines of business, so decisions affecting ADGE may be made in respect of the larger combined business as a whole rather than ADGE's business individually.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nADGE's directors and executive officers have interests in the transaction that may be different from the interests as our stockholders.\nADGE's stockholders should be aware that ADGE's directors and executive officers have certain interests in the transaction that may be different from or in addition to the interests of ADGE's stockholders generally. These interests include the treatment in the transaction of ADGE's stock option and restricted stock awards, and certain other rights held by ADGE's directors and executive officers, and the indemnification of ADGE's directors and executive officers by Tecogen. ADGE's board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other things, in evaluating and approving the Merger Agreement and the transaction and in recommending that ADGE's stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nThe completion of the Merger is not conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment, and neither ADGE nor Tecogen intends to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the transaction.\nIt is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, (the \"intended tax treatment\"). However, the completion of the transaction is not conditioned on the transaction qualifying for the intended tax treatment or on the receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect, and whether or not the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment depends on facts that will not be known until the transaction is completed. No assurance can be given that the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment. In addition, neither ADGE nor Tecogen intends to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the transaction. Accordingly, even if ADGE and Tecogen conclude that the transaction qualifies for the intended tax treatment, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge that conclusion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.\nIt will not be known at the time of the special meeting at which ADGE\u2019s stockholders will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement whether the requirements for the transaction to qualify for the intended tax treatment will be met.\nFailure to complete the transaction could negatively impact ADGE\u2019s and Tecogen\u2019s stock prices and our and Tecogen\u2019s future business and financial results.\nIf the transaction is not completed for any reason, including as a result of ADGE's stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement, ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transaction, ADGE and Tecogen would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nADGE and Tecogen may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the stock prices and debt instruments of ADGE or Tecogen;\n\u2022\nADGE and Tecogen may experience negative reactions from their respective customers and employees;\n\u2022\nADGE and Tecogen will be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the transaction is completed;\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s businesses prior to completion of the transaction. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent ADGE and Tecogen from making certain acquisitions or taking other specified actions during the pendency of the transaction;\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the transaction (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either ADGE or Tecogen as an independent company.\nFurther, ADGE and Tecogen could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction or related to any proceeding commenced against ADGE or Tecogen to enforce performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the transaction is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nAlthough Tecogen expects that the transaction will result in synergies and other benefits to Tecogen, Tecogen may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the realization of synergies, and other challenges.\nADGE and Tecogen have operated and, until completion of the transaction, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that the respective businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits. It is possible that there could be loss of ADGE's or Tecogen\u2019s key employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction so the combined company performs as the parties hope:\n\u2022\ncombining the companies\u2019 corporate functions;\n\u2022\ncombining ADGE's and Tecogen\u2019s businesses in a manner that permits Tecogen to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the transaction, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, and vendors;\n\u2022\ndetermining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nintegrating fully the companies\u2019 administrative and technology infrastructures; and\n\u2022\neffecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 management and resources may be focused on completion of the transaction and integration planning of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nAfter the transaction, ADGE's stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Tecogen than they currently have in ADGE and will exercise less influence over management.\nBased on the number of shares of ADGE's common stock outstanding as of March 17, 2017, and the number of shares of Tecogen common stock outstanding as of March 17, 2016, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the transaction, ADGE's former stockholders will own approximately 19% of the outstanding shares of Tecogen common stock. Consequently, ADGE's stockholders will have less influence over the management and policies of Tecogen than they currently have over ADGE's management and policies.\nThe transaction may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Tecogen\u2019s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Tecogen\u2019s common stock.\nTecogen currently expects the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share within 12 months after the completion of the transaction. This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, Tecogen could fail to realize all the benefits anticipated in the transaction or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits. Such factors could, combined with the issuance of shares of Tecogen common stock in the Merger, result in the transaction being dilutive to Tecogen\u2019s earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of shares of Tecogen\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe have incurred losses, and these losses may continue.\nWe have incurred losses in each of our fiscal years since inception. There is no assurance that profitability will be achieved in the near term, if at all in the future.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nWe are dependent on a large customer. The loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, one of our customers accounted for approximately 18.3% and 18.0% of revenue, respectively. Accounts receivable from this customer at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 20.6% and 27.0%, respectively, of the total accounts receivable balance at each such year end. Although subject to a long-term contracts expiring through 2029, the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and may be unable to successfully compete against competitors having significantly greater resources and experience.\nOur business may be limited by competition from energy services companies arising from the breakup of conventional regulated electric utilities. Such competitors, both in the equipment and energy services sectors, are likely to have far greater financial and other resources than us, and could possess specialized market knowledge with existing channels of access to prospective customer locations. We may be unable to successfully compete against those competitors\nOur ability to access capital for the repayment of debts and for future growth is limited as the financial markets can be unpredictable.\nOur ability to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions or a slowdown in the economy, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. We can provide no assurance that capital will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nBecause unfavorable utility regulations make the installation of our systems more difficult or less economical, any slowdown in the utility deregulation process would be an impediment to the growth of our business.\nIn the past, many electric utility companies have raised opposition to DG, a critical element of our On-Site Utility business. Such resistance has generally taken the form of stringent standards for interconnection and the use of targeted rate structures as disincentives to combined generation of on-site power and heating or cooling services. A DG company's ability to obtain reliable and affordable back-up power through interconnection with the grid is essential to our business model. Utility policies and regulations in most states are often not prepared to accommodate widespread on-site generation. These barriers erected by electric utility companies and unfavorable regulations, where applicable, make more difficult or uneconomic our ability to connect to the electric grid at customer sites and are an impediment to the growth of our business. The development of our business could be adversely affected by any slowdown or reversal in the utility deregulation process or by difficulties in negotiating backup power supply agreements with electric providers in the areas where we intend to do business.\nThe economic viability of our projects depends on the price spread between fuel and electricity, and the variability of the prices of these components creates a risk that our projects will be uneconomic.\nThe economic viability of DG projects is dependent upon the price spread between fuel costs and electricity prices. Volatility in one component of the spread, the cost of natural gas and other fuels (e.g., propane or distillate oil) can be managed to a greater or lesser extent by means of futures contracts. However, the regional rates charged for both base load and peak electricity services may decline periodically due to excess capacity arising from over-building of utility power plants or recessions in economic activity. Any sustained weakness in electricity prices could significantly limit the market for our cogeneration, cooling equipment and On-Site Utility energy services and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe may be exposed to substantial liability claims if we fail to fulfill our obligations to our customers.\nWe enter into contracts with large commercial and not-for-profit customers under which we assume responsibility for meeting a portion of the customers' building energy demand and equipment installation. We may be exposed to substantial liability claims if we fail to fulfill our obligations to customers. There can be no assurance that we will not be vulnerable to claims by customers and by third parties that are beyond any contractual protections that we are able to negotiate. We may be unable to obtain liability and other insurance on terms and at prices that are commercially acceptable to us. As a result, liability claims could cause us significant financial harm.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nExpiring customer contracts may lead to decreases in revenue and increases in expenses.\nOne of our customer contracts has an expiration date in 2017 and three in 2018 which, if not extended, may lead to decreases in revenue. This decrease in revenue will be due to less energy billing. Expiring customer contracts can also lead to an increase in expenses because we will have to remove the equipment at the customer location. We will remove the equipment at our own expense and are obligated to do so at the end of the customer contract.\nEach year, a portion of our customers contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. We may not be able to renew or extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts.\nWe may fail to make sales to certain prospective customers because of resistance from facilities management personnel to the outsourcing of their service function.\nAny outsourcing of non-core activities by institutional or commercial entities will generally lead to reductions in permanent on-site staff employment. As a result, our proposals to implement On-Site Utility contracts are likely to encounter strong initial resistance from the facilities managers whose jobs will be threatened by energy outsourcing. The growth of our business will depend upon our ability to overcome such barriers among prospective customers.\nFuture government regulations, such as increased emissions standards, safety standards and taxes, may adversely impact the economics of our business.\nThe operation of DG equipment at our customers' sites may be subject to future changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (e.g., emissions, safety, taxes, etc.). Any such new or substantially altered rules and standards may adversely affect our revenues, profits and general financial condition.\nIf we cannot expand our network of skilled technical support personnel, we will be unable to grow our business.\nEach additional customer site for our services requires the initial installation and subsequent maintenance and service of equipment to be provided by a team of technicians skilled in a broad range of technologies, including combustion, instrumentation, heat transfer, information processing, microprocessor controls, fluid systems and other elements of DG. If we are unable to recruit, train, motivate, sub-contract, and retain such personnel in each of the regional markets where our business operates we will be unable to grow our business in those markets.\nFuture technology changes may render obsolete various elements of equipment comprising our On-Site Utility installations.\nWe must select equipment for our DG projects so as to achieve attractive operating efficiencies, while avoiding excessive downtimes from the failure of unproven technologies. If we are unable to achieve a proper balance between the cost, efficiency and reliability of equipment selected for our projects, our growth and profitability will be adversely impacted.\nWe will need to raise additional capital for our business, which will dilute existing stockholders.\nWe expect to require additional financings to implement our overall business plan. Equity financings will dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Our ability to raise an adequate amount of capital and the terms of any capital that we are able to raise will be dependent upon our progress in implementing demonstration projects and related marketing service development activities. If we do not make adequate progress, we may be unable to raise adequate funds, which will limit our ability to expand our business. If the terms of any equity financings are unfavorable, the dilutive impact on our stockholders might be severe.\nOur revenue from energy billing is partly dependent on the weather and increased temperatures could reduce our revenue.\nIn warmer months the customers are not using as much thermal energy as they do not have as much of a demand to heat their locations. Due to the demand being lower in warmer months we may not be able to bill for thermal energy and in turn may have a decrease in revenue.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nCertain characteristics of specific sites may make it difficult to install and maintain our equipment.\nWhen entering into customer contracts there is a risk that the customer's site will not be well-suited for our equipment. In certain situations, installing and maintaining our equipment at a customer's site may cost more than anticipated, which could lead to an increase in expenses. This has the potential to lead to a decrease in revenue if the site is not capable of running properly.\nOperating diverse on-site utility sites across many different locations presents significant maintenance challenges.\nWe operate 92 systems at various locations which require considerable monitoring and maintenance on a twenty-four hour basis. Managing multiple sites simultaneously creates challenges of engineering resource and spare part availability.\nOur business may be impacted adversely by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances that are not within our control.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on us, our suppliers, and manufacturing vendors. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers, or to receive products from our manufacturers and suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. If major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, we could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing vendors and suppliers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.\nIncreased IT security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems and networks in connection with our business activities, and we collect and store sensitive data. IT security threats and sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, are increasing in sophistication and frequency. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. As we grow, we may experience attempts from hackers and other third parties to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems and networks. Any such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage IT risks within our control, we can provide no assurance that our actions will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks and data. A failure of or breach in IT security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and operations disruptions. Any of these events in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nInvestor confidence in the price of our stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officers and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded there is a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAs an SEC registrant, we are subject to the rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require us to include in our annual report on Form 10-K our management\u2019s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting (\u201cmanagement\u2019s report\u201d). If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting, particularly that relating to revenue recognition, is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss in investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Investor confidence and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our principal executive officers and principal financial and accounting officer have performed an evaluation of controls and procedures and concluded that our controls were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by our company in reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and based on this evaluation and concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Currently, we have material weaknesses in financial reporting relating to the lack of a sufficient number of controls over manual processes of revenue recognition. This constitutes a material weakness in financial reporting. Any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and might require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.\nIn order to comply with public reporting requirements, we must continue to strengthen our financial systems and controls, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial statements.\nRefinement of our internal controls and procedures will be required as we manage future growth successfully and operate effectively as a public company. Such refinement of our internal controls, as well as compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related requirements, will be costly and will place a significant burden on management. We cannot assure you that measures already taken, or any future measures, will enable us to provide accurate and timely financial reports, particularly if we are unable to hire additional personnel in our accounting and financial department, or if we lose personnel in this area. Any failure to improve our internal controls or other problems with our financial systems or internal controls could result in delays or inaccuracies in reporting financial information, or non-compliance with SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements, any of which could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nOur directors and named executive officers beneficially own approximately 9.9% of our common stock.\nAs of March 16, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 9.9% of our shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of options, warrants and restricted stock grants, or approximately 5,050,913 shares. These stockholders, if they acted together, could exert influence on matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions, consolidation and sale of substantially all of our assets or other change of control transaction. This concentration of ownership may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business.\nCurrent shareholdings may be diluted if we make future equity issuances or if outstanding warrants or options are exercised for shares of our common stock.\n\u201cDilution\u201d refers to the reduction in the voting effect and proportionate ownership interest of a given number of shares of common stock as the total number of shares increases. Our issuance of additional stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt may result in dilution to the interests of shareholders and may also result in the reduction of your stock\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nprice. The sale of a substantial number of shares into the market, or even the perception that sales could occur, could depress the price of the common stock. Also, the exercise of warrants and options may result in additional dilution.\nAs of December 31, 2016, an aggregate of 5,559,270 shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options. The holders of outstanding warrants (and other convertible securities or derivatives, if any are subsequently issued) have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock, if any, without assuming the risk of ownership, with a resulting dilution in the interests of other shareholders. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital if it should be needed for our business while the options, warrants and convertible securities are outstanding. At any time at which the holders of the options, warrants or convertible securities might be expected to exercise or convert them, we would probably be able to obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than that provided by those securities.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate and thus inhibit our ability to raise additional capital when it is needed.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends, our stockholders will receive no current income from holding our stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We currently expect to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock could be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nFailure to comply with the listing requirements of the NYSE MKT could lead to the commencement of delisting proceedings in accordance the NYSE MKT\u2019s Company Guide. Delisting could limit investors' ability to effect transactions in the Company's securities and subject the stock to additional trading restrictions.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, a national securities exchange. To maintain such listing, the Company is required to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT as set forth in its Company Guide. If the Company is unable to maintain the listing of its stock on the NYSE MKT or another exchange for failure to comply with the continued listing requirements, including timely filing of Exchange Act reports and compliance with the NYSE MKT\u2019s corporate governance requirements, the Company and its security holders could face significant material adverse consequences including a limited availability of market quotations for its stock and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage mergers and other transactions.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us. These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay or prevent someone from acquiring our business. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. The ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock is a traditional anti-takeover measure. This provision may be beneficial to our management and the board of directors in a hostile tender offer, and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such tender offer, or who may want to replace some or all of the members of the board of directors.\nOur board of directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of directors may, without shareholder approval, issue one or more new series of preferred stock with rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging, an acquisition or change of control of us. Although we do not have any current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may do so in the future.\nAMERICAN DG ENERGY INC.\nTrading of our common stock is restricted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's, or the SEC's, \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities may be covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and other quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure and suitability requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our capital stock. Trading of our capital stock may be restricted by the SEC's \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.", "PERMNO": 93052, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "ADGE"}
