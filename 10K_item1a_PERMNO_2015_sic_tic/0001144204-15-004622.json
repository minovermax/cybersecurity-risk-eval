{"cik": "1076682", "company": "MAJESCO ENTERTAINMENT CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nOur review of our strategic alternatives may result in a complete transformation of our Company and we may not be successful in this new venture.\nWe are currently evaluating our strategic alternatives. We have significantly reduced our video game publishing and development activities. We may (although we have no current arrangements in place) invest in a totally unrelated business or businesses. Such an action may result in a change in our board of directors, management or financial structure and may lead to substantial reduction in our cash balances or substantial dilution to existing shareholders should we utilize our shares for acquisition. Despite our best efforts, we may not be successful in financing and/or operating a new venture.\nOur financial resources are limited and we will need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our business.\nWe do not expect to generate the level of revenues going forward as we have achieved in prior years from our video game business. This significantly reduced revenue will impact our needs for future capital. We cannot ensure that additional funding will be available or, if it is available, that it can be obtained on terms and conditions we will deem acceptable. Any additional funding derived from the sale of equity securities is likely to result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that may prevent us from raising additional capital or may cause the terms upon which we raise additional capital, if additional capital is available, to be less favorable to us than would otherwise be the case. If we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we will be forced to cease our business activities and dissolve the Company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various severances, contract termination and other dissolution-related obligations.\nIf we make a significant acquisition that requires the issuance of our shares we may be required to reapply for NASDAQ listing.\nReapplying for NASDAQ listing may require us to satisfy the more stringent original listing standards of the NASDAQ Capital Market, which has substantially higher standards than the continuing listing standards. If any such application is not approved, our shares of common stock could be delisted.\nWe could fail in future financing efforts or be delisted from NASDAQ if we fail to receive shareholder approval for the full conversion of the securities issued in the private placement or any future transaction(s).\nWe are required under the NASDAQ rules to obtain shareholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by NASDAQ. On December 17, 2014 we closed a private placement in connection with which we issued $6.0 million of units consisting of one share of series A convertible preferred stock and one warrant, $5.0 million of which is being held in escrow pending shareholder approval. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Private Placement\u201d for more information on the private placement. In addition, funding of our operations in the future or acquisitions may require issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding, but we might not be successful in obtaining the required shareholder approval for such an issuance. If we are unable to receive shareholder approval for the full conversion of the securities issued in the private placement or obtain future financing due to shareholder approval difficulties, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations or maintain our listing with NASDAQ, which could have a negative impact on the trading market for our stock and our ability to raise capital in the future.\nWe have experienced recent net losses and we may incur future net losses, which may cause a decrease in our stock price.\nWhile we generated net income in certain years prior to fiscal 2013, we incurred net losses of $16.2 million in fiscal 2014 and $12.6 million in fiscal 2013. We may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to offset our costs and may sustain net losses in future periods. Any such losses may have an adverse effect on our future operating prospects, liquidity and stock price.\nWe are heavily reliant on our factoring arrangement.\nWe utilize credit under a factoring agreement with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. (referred to herein as Rosenthal) whereby we sell our receivables for immediate payment of a portion of the invoice amount and, in some instances, the ability to take additional cash advances. This is our primary source of financing. If Rosenthal suffered financial difficulty, or our relationship with Rosenthal deteriorated, this could significantly impact our liquidity.\nWe have experienced volatility in the price of our stock and are subject to volatility in the future.\nThe price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility. In the 24 months ended October 31, 2014, the high and low bid quotations for our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Capital Market ranged between a high of $8.75 and a low of $0.81. The historic market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price paid for our shares and may not be indicative of future market prices, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, as we have significantly reduced our video game operations, and are seeking strategic alternatives, we cannot predict the performance of our stock and the price of our stock may change dramatically in response to our success or failure to consummate such a strategic alternative transaction\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market, referred to herein as Nasdaq. This market has continued listing requirements that we must continue to maintain to avoid delisting. The standards include, among others, a minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share and any of: (i) a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million; (ii) a market value of listed securities of $35 million; or (iii) net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in the two of the last three fiscal years. Our results of operations and our fluctuating stock price directly impact our ability to satisfy these listing standards. In the event we are unable to maintain these listing standards, we may be subject to delisting.\nA delisting from Nasdaq would result in our common stock being eligible for listing on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (the \u201cOTCBB\u201d). The OTCBB is generally considered to be a less efficient system than markets such as Nasdaq or other national exchanges because of lower trading volumes, transaction delays and reduced security analyst and news media coverage. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. Additionally, trading of our common stock on the OTCBB may make us less desirable to institutional investors and may, therefore, limit our future equity funding options and could negatively affect the liquidity of our stock.\nA significant portion of our revenue in 2014 was generated from games based on the Zumba Fitness property.\nApproximately 54% of our net revenue in 2014 was generated from the Zumba Fitness series of games. We license the rights to publish these games from a third party. In November 2011, we released the sequels Zumba Fitness 2 and Zumba Fitness Rush for the Wii and Kinect platforms, respectively. In November 2012, we released the sequel Zumba Fitness Core for the Wii and Kinect platforms. In November 2013, we released the sequel Zumba Fitness World Party for the Wii and Kinect platforms. We do not expect to release any new Zumba games in the future, which may have a significant impact on our revenues.\nA decrease in the popularity of our licensed brands and, correspondingly, the video games we publish based on those brands could negatively impact our revenues and financial position.\nCertain games released in 2014 were based upon popular licensed brands. As previously mentioned, approximately 54% of our net revenues in 2014 were generated from the Zumba franchise games, first commercially released in November 2010. A decrease in the popularity of the Zumba property or other licensed properties would negatively impact our ability to sell games based upon such licenses and could lead to lower net sales, profitability, and/or an impairment of our licenses, which would negatively impact our profitability.\nCustomer accommodations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWhen demand for our offerings falls below expectations, we may negotiate accommodations to retailers or distributors in order to maintain our relationships with our customers and access to our sales channels. These accommodations include negotiation of price discounts and credits against future orders commonly referred to as price protection. At the time of product shipment, we establish provisions for price protection and other similar allowances. These provisions are established according to our estimates of the potential for markdown allowances based upon historical rates, expected sales, retailer inventories of products and other factors. We cannot predict with certainty whether existing provisions will be sufficient to offset any accommodations we will provide, nor can we predict the amount or nature of accommodations that we will provide in the future. If actual accommodations exceed our provisions, our earnings would be reduced, possibly materially. Any such reduction may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The granting of price protection and other allowances reduces our ability to collect receivables and impacts our availability for advances from our factoring arrangement. The continued granting of substantial price protection and other allowances may require additional funding sources to fund operations, but there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIncreased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the sales of our products.\nRetailers typically have limited shelf space and promotional resources, such as circulars and in-store advertising, to support any one product among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment offerings.\nCompetition for retail support and shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures or reduce prices to retailers. Competitors with more extensive lines, popular products and greater financial resources frequently have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain the levels of support and shelf space that our competitors receive. As a result, sales of our products may be less than expected, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA weak global economic environment could result in increased volatility in our stock price.\nCurrent uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy as consumers and retailers may defer or choose not to make purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which could negatively affect demand for our products. Additionally, due to the weak economic conditions and tightened credit environment, some of our retailers and customers may not have the same purchasing power, leading to lower purchases of our games for placement into distribution channels. Reduced consumer demand for our products could materially impact our operating results.\nTermination or modification of our agreements with platform hardware manufacturers may adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to obtain a license in order to develop and distribute software for each of the manufacturers of video game hardware. We currently have licenses from Sony to develop products for PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, from Nintendo to develop products for the DS, DSi, 3DS, Wii and WiiU and from Microsoft to develop products for the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. These licenses must be periodically renewed, and if they are not, or if any of our licenses are terminated or adversely modified, we may not be able to distribute any of our games on that platform or we may be required to do so on less attractive terms.\nOur platform licensors control the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms.\nPursuant to certain of our publisher license agreements, such platform licensors retain sole discretion to determine the fees to be charged for both base level and premium online services available via their online platforms. Each licensor\u2019s ability to set royalty rates makes it challenging for us to predict our costs, and increased costs may negatively impact our operating margins. As a result of such varying fee structures, we may be unable to distribute our games in a cost-effective manner through such distribution channels.\nIntellectual property claims may increase our costs or require us to cease selling affected products, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment of original content, including publication and distribution, sometimes results in claims of intellectual property infringement. Although we make efforts to ensure our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may allege infringement. These claims and any litigation resulting from these claims may result in damage awards payable by us; could prevent us from selling the affected product; or require us to redesign the affected product to avoid infringement or obtain a license for future sales of the affected product.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation resulting from these claims could require us to incur substantial costs.\nA reduced workforce presents additional risk to the effectiveness of our internal controls.\nAs discussed in this annual report, we have significantly reduced our workforce. A smaller workforce impacts our internal controls over financial reporting and can affect the adequacy of our controls. We cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be subject to liability and/or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90539, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTE"}
