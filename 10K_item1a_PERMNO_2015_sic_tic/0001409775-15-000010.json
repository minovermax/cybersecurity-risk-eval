Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAny deterioration in national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices, could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national, regional and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operations even if other favorable events occur. The Company's banking operations are locally-oriented and community-based. Accordingly, the Company expects to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the local residential and commercial real estate markets it serves, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas. These economic conditions could require the Company to charge-off a higher percentage of loans or increase provisions for credit losses, which would reduce its net income.\nSignificant declines in the housing market from 2007 through 2010, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by many financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities, but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Although the U.S. economy has shown modest improvement recently, economic conditions continue to pose a risk to the financial system. The Company is part of the financial system and a systemic lack of available credit, a lack of confidence in the financial sector, continued volatility in the financial markets and/or reduced business activity could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA return of the volatile economic conditions experienced in the U.S. during 2008-2009, including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets, for an extended period of time, particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures, may materially and adversely affect the Company.\nDeclining oil prices could adversely affect the Company's performance.\nAs of December 31, 2014, energy-related loan balances represented approximately 6 percent of the Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio. This amount is comprised of loans directly related to energy, such as oilfield services, refining and support, exploration and production, and pipeline transportation of natural gas, crude oil and other refined petroleum products. In late 2014, oil prices began declining, which has had an adverse effect on some of the Bank\u2019s borrowers in this portfolio and on the value of the collateral securing some of these loans. If oil prices remain low, the cash flows of the Bank\u2019s customers in this industry could be adversely impacted which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans. These factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, energy production and related industries represent a significant part of the economies in some of the Bank\u2019s primary markets. A prolonged period of low oil prices could have a negative impact on the economies and real estate markets of states such as Texas, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition of member countries, especially in Spain, could have an adverse impact on global financial markets, the current U.S. economic recovery and the Company.\nCertain European Union member countries have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern over such countries' ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. Fiscal austerity measures such as raising taxes and reducing entitlements have improved the ability of some member countries to service their debt, but have challenged economic growth and efforts to lower unemployment rates in the region.\nThe Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBVA, which is based in Spain and serves as a source of strength and capital to the Company. Accordingly, European Union weakness, particularly in Spain, could directly impact BBVA and could have an adverse impact on the Company's business or financial condition.\nA weaker European economy may transcend Europe, cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies, and likewise affect U.S.-based financial institutions, the stability of the global financial markets and the economic recovery underway in the U.S. Should the U.S. economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like the Company, could be affected.\nWeakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan market, has adversely affected the Company and may continue to adversely affect it.\nWeakness in the non-agency secondary market for residential mortgage loans has limited the market for and liquidity of many nonconforming mortgage loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the past corrections in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could result in further price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans that the Company holds, and mortgage loan originations and profits on sales of mortgage loans. Declining real estate prices have caused cyclically higher delinquencies and losses on mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. These conditions have resulted in losses, write-downs and impairment charges in the Company's mortgage and other business units.\nFuture declines in real estate values, low home sales volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result of unemployment, interest rate resets on ARMs or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, counterparties to insurance arrangements used to mitigate risk associated with increased defaults in the real estate market have been stressed by weaknesses in the real estate market and a commensurate increase in the number of claims. Further, decreases in real estate values might adversely affect the creditworthiness of state and local governments, and this might result in decreased profitability or credit losses from loans made to such governments. In markets dependent on energy production, falling energy prices may adversely affect real estate values. A decline in home values or overall economic weakness could also have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate or other assets which the Company owns as a result of foreclosing a loan and its ability to realize value on such assets.\nThe Company is subject to legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, and future legislation or regulation could require it to change certain business practices, reduce its revenue, impose additional costs on the Company or otherwise adversely affect its business operations and competitive position.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which has changed and will continue to change substantially the legal and regulatory framework under which the Company operates. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial-services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. The following are among the provisions that may affect the Company's operations:\n\u2022\nCreation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.\n\u2022\nNew limitations on federal preemption.\n\u2022\nApplication of heightened capital, liquidity, single counterparty credit limits, stress testing, risk management and other enhanced prudential standards to the U.S. operations of BBVA, including the Parent and the Bank.\n\u2022\nRequirement that a parent company and its subsidiary bank(s) be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies.\n\u2022\nChanges to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.\n\u2022\nPermanently raising the FDIC's standard maximum deposit insurance limit to $250,000 for federal deposit insurance.\n\u2022\nImposing further limits on interchange fees.\n\u2022\nRepeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, effective July 21, 2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.\n\u2022\nRestrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.\n\u2022\nRequirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating credit worthiness.\n\u2022\nNew prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund.\n\u2022\nCreation of a new framework for the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and new regulations for the securitization market and the strengthening of the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets by the SEC.\nSome of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of the Company's business, the value of assets it holds or the collateral available for its loans, require changes to business practices or force the Company to discontinue businesses and expose it to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk.\nMany of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others are subject to further study, rulemaking and the discretion of regulatory bodies. In light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, the Company cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on the Company's businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act's provisions restricting bank interchange fees, and the rules promulgated thereunder, may negatively impact the Company's revenues and earnings.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules effective October 1, 2011, limiting the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to electronic debit transactions. Interchange fees are charges that merchants pay to the Company and other credit card companies and card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Since taking effect, these limitations have reduced the Company's debit card interchange revenues and have created meaningful compliance costs. Additional limits may further reduce the Company's debit card interchange revenues and create additional compliance costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act's consumer protection regulations could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board recently enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. The Company has implemented changes to its business practices relating to overdraft payment programs in order to comply with these regulations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company's overdraft and insufficient funds fees represented a significant amount of noninterest fees. Since these new regulations took effect on July 1, 2011, the fees received by the Company for automated overdraft payment services have decreased, thereby adversely impacting its noninterest income. Complying with these regulations has resulted in increased operational costs for the Company, which may continue to rise. The actual impact of these regulations in future periods could vary due to a variety of factors, including changes in customer behavior, economic conditions and other factors, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe CFPB's residential mortgage regulations could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe CFPB recently finalized a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct, the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The final rules require banks to, among other things: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new \u201creasonable ability to repay\u201d test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower's principal residence, (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation, and (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for \u201chigher priced mortgage loans.\u201d These new rules create operational and strategic challenges for the Company, as it is both a mortgage originator and a servicer. For example, business models for cost, pricing, delivery, compensation and risk management will need to be reevaluated and potentially revised, perhaps substantially. Additionally, programming changes and enhancements to systems will be necessary to comply with the new rules. Some of these new rules took effect in June 2013, while others became effective in January 2014. The CFPB continues to periodically revise these new rules, and forthcoming additional rulemaking affecting the residential mortgage business is also expected. These rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB could require changes to the Company's business, result in increased compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of such business.\nThe Company is subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if it fails to meet these standards its financial condition and operations would be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Basel III final rule and provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act will increase capital requirements for banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank. Consistent with the Basel Committee's Basel III capital framework, the U.S. Basel III final rule includes a new minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all U.S. banking organizations, including the Bank and the Company. Failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer would result in increasingly stringent restrictions on a banking organization's ability to make dividend payments and other capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Under the U.S. Basel III final rule, trust preferred securities no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies such as the Company.\nThe Company is also required to submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board under the CCAR process. The capital plan must include an assessment of the Company's expected uses and sources of capital over a forward-looking planning horizon of at least nine quarters, a detailed description of the Company's process for assessing capital adequacy, the Company's capital policy, and a discussion of any expected changes to the Company's business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity. Based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment, including a supervisory stress test conducted as part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve Board will either object to the Company's capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection to the Company by March 31, 2015 for the capital planning cycle beginning October 1, 2014 and by June 30 of each calendar year for each capital planning cycle beginning January 1, 2016 and thereafter. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to a capital plan, the Company may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the Federal Reserve Board has indicated its non-objection. In addition to capital planning, the Company and the Bank are subject to capital stress testing requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWhile the Company can give no assurances as to the outcome of the annual CCAR process in subsequent years or specific interactions with the regulators, it believes it has a strong capital position.\nThe Federal Reserve Board evaluates the Company's liquidity as part of the supervisory process. In addition, the Basel Committee has developed a set of internationally-agreed upon quantitative liquidity metrics: the LCR and the NSFR. The LCR was developed to ensure that covered banking organizations have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day liquidity stress period. The NSFR has a time horizon of one year and has been developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. The Basel Committee contemplates that major jurisdictions will have begun to phase in the LCR requirement on January 1, 2015. It contemplates that the NSFR, including any revisions, will be implemented as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.\nIn September 2014, the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule implementing the LCR in the United States. The rule introduces a version of the LCR applicable to certain large bank holding companies such as the Company. This version differs in certain respects from the Basel Committee\u2019s version of the LCR, including a narrower definition of high-quality liquid assets, different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments\nand transactions and a shorter phase-in schedule beginning on January 1, 2015 and ending on January 1, 2017. The federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR in the United States. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has adopted liquidity risk management, stress testing and liquidity buffer requirements as part of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the U.S. operations of Large FBOs such as BBVA. The Company and the Bank are part of BBVA\u2019s U.S. operations.\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule to enhance its supervision and regulation of the U.S. operations of Large FBOs such as BBVA. BBVA's U.S. operations are conducted primarily through the Company and the Bank. Under the Federal Reserve Board's rule, Large FBOs with $50 billion or more in U.S. assets held outside of their U.S. branches and agencies, such as BBVA, will be required to create a separately-capitalized top-tier U.S. IHC that will hold all of the Large FBO's U.S. bank and nonbank subsidiaries, such as the Bank and the Company. The Large FBO\u2019s combined U.S. operations (including its U.S. branches, agencies and subsidiaries) will be subject to U.S. risk-based and leverage capital, liquidity, risk management, stress testing and other enhanced prudential standards on a consolidated basis. Large FBOs must comply with the enhanced prudential standards by July 1, 2016. Large FBOs with non-branch/agency U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must also establish an IHC by July 1, 2016 and transfer all ownership interests in U.S. subsidiaries to the IHC by July 1, 2017. Large FBOs with $50 billion or more in non-branch/agency U.S. assets were required to submit an implementation plan to the Federal Reserve Board by January 1, 2015 describing how the FBO planned to comply with the IHC requirement and certain other enhanced prudential standards. The Company submitted its implementation plan in December 2014.\nBBVA established the Parent in 2007 to serve as a holding company for its U.S. subsidiaries and intends to designate the Parent as its IHC. As a U.S.-based bank holding company with more than $50 billion in assets, the Parent is required to comply with the enhanced prudential standards applicable to top-tier U.S.-based bank holding companies beginning on January 1, 2015 and until BBVA has designated an IHC, at which time the IHC will be required to comply with the enhanced prudential standards applicable to U.S. IHCs. These enhanced prudential standards could affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Parent is a holding company and depends on its subsidiaries for liquidity in the form of dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, including the Bank. The principal source of cash flow for the Parent is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank. Regulations of both the Federal Reserve and the State of Alabama affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions to the Company and to make loans to the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. Limitations on the Parent\u2019s ability to receive dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and on its ability to pay dividends on common stock. For additional information regarding these limitations see Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors - Dividends.\nThe Company is subject to credit risk.\nWhen the Company loans money, commits to loan money or enters into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, it incurs credit risk, which is the risk of losses if its borrowers do not repay their loans or its counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. Many of the Company's products expose it to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments.\nFurther downgrades to the U.S. government's credit rating, or the credit rating of its securities, by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions, as well as the Company's operations, earnings and financial condition.\nOn August 5, 2011, S&P downgraded the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating of long-term U.S. federal debt from AAA to AA+ while also keeping its outlook negative. Moody's also lowered its outlook to \u201cNegative\u201d on June 2, 2011, and Fitch lowered its outlook to \u201cNegative\u201d on November 28, 2011. During 2013 and 2014, the three credit rating agencies revised their outlook from \"Negative\" to \"Stable.\" It is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the U.S. government could be correspondingly affected by any downgrade to the U.S. government's sovereign\ncredit rating, including the rating of U.S. Treasury securities. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including the Company, and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short-term debt market.\nFurther downgrades of the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, and the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations, could impact the Company's ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. The Company cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on the Company. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which the Company is subject and any related adverse effects on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction in the Company's own credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and increase the cost of its capital markets funding.\nAdequate liquidity is essential to the Company's businesses. A reduction to the Company's credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including the Company's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Adverse changes in the credit ratings of the Kingdom of Spain, which subsequently could impact BBVA, could also adversely impact the Company's credit rating. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the housing and financial markets, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain its current ratings. The Company's failure to maintain those ratings could increase its borrowing costs, require the Company to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, and may also limit the Company's access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements.\nThe Company's ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by its credit rating. The interest rates that the Company pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it receives from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to the Company's credit rating could affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to the Company's credit rating could also create obligations or liabilities for it under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase its costs or otherwise have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by the Company could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the Company's income and cash flows.\nThe Company's earnings and financial condition are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads, meaning the difference between interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect the Company's earnings and financial condition. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates.\nRegional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board, affect interest income and interest expense. The Company has policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates, however, may still have an adverse effect on the Company's profitability. While the Company actively manages against these risks, if its assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than planned for, then its risk mitigation techniques may be insufficient to protect against the risk.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, regulatory investigations, examinations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments relating thereto, could materially affect the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company faces legal risks in its business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high and are escalating. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the Company may have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm its business prospects.\nThe Company and its operations are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, thereby increasing the Company\u2019s costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In particular, inquiries could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions and may increase the Company's compliance costs, require changes in the Company's business practices, affect the Company's competitiveness, impair the Company's profitability, harm the Company's reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Company's business.\nIn February 2015, the Federal Reserve Board announced the results of its regularly scheduled examination covering 2011 and 2012 to determine the Bank\u2019s compliance with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Reserve Board to evaluate the record of the Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Bank received a rating of \u201cneeds to improve.\" The Bank\u2019s rating in this CRA examination has resulted in restrictions on certain activities, including certain mergers and acquisitions and applications to open branches or certain other facilities. Such restrictions will last at least until the Bank\u2019s next CRA examination. The Bank\u2019s next CRA examination is expected to begin during 2015, although the precise timing of the completion of the examination and any results there from may not occur until later.\nThe Company's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which it is entitled may not be honored. Any claims asserted against the Company, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed the Company's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. The Company may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nDisruptions in the Company's ability to access capital markets may adversely affect its capital resources and liquidity.\nThe Company may access capital markets to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of its clients. Other sources of contingent funding available to the Company include inter-bank borrowings, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB capacity and borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window. Any occurrence that may limit the Company's access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt investors, its depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of its debt rating, may adversely affect the Company's capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity.\nStarting in mid-2007, significant turmoil and volatility in global financial markets increased, though current volatility has declined. Such disruptions in the liquidity of financial markets may directly impact the Company to the extent it needs to access capital markets to raise funds to support its business and overall liquidity position. This situation could adversely affect the cost of such funds or the Company's ability to raise such funds. If the Company were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, it might be unable to meet customers' needs, which could adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nThe Company may suffer increased losses in its loan portfolio despite enhancement of its underwriting policies and practices, and the Company's allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to cover such eventual losses.\nThe Company seeks to mitigate risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting policies and practices, which often include analysis of (1) a borrower's credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; (2) valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and (3) verification of liquid assets. The Company's underwriting policies, practices and standards are periodically reviewed and, if appropriate, enhanced in response to changing market conditions and/or corporate strategies.\nLike other financial institutions, the Company maintains allowances for credit losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. The Company's allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to cover eventual loan losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, on December 20, 2012, the FASB issued for public comment a Proposed Accounting Standards Update, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Subtopic 825-15), that would substantially change the accounting for credit losses under current U.S. GAAP standards. Under current U.S. GAAP standards, credit losses are not reflected in financial statements until it is probable that the credit loss has been incurred. Under the Credit Loss Proposal, an entity would reflect in its financial statements its current estimate of credit losses on financial assets over the expected life of each financial asset. The comment period on the Credit Loss Proposal closed on May 31, 2013. The Credit Loss Proposal, if adopted as proposed, may have a negative impact on the Company's reported earnings, capital, regulatory capital ratios, as well as on regulatory limits which are based on capital (e.g., loans to affiliates) since it would accelerate the recognition of estimated credit losses.\nThe value of the Company\u2019s goodwill may decline in the future.\nA significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower growth rates, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may require that the Company take charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If the Company were to conclude that a future write-down of its goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, the Company would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and the Company may be unable to effectively compete or may experience heightened cyber-security risks as a result of these changes.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs. The Company's future success may depend, in part, on its ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Some of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. As a result, the Company's ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and its business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks, especially as it continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that it faces are e-fraud and breach of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customers' or the Company's accounts. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to the Company if successful.\nRecently, there has been a series of distributed denial of service attacks on financial services companies. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. Generally, these attacks have not been conducted to steal financial data, but meant to interrupt or suspend a company's internet service. While these events may not result in a breach of client data and account information, the attacks can adversely affect the performance of a company\u2019s website and in some instances prevented customers from accessing a company\u2019s website. Distributed denial of service attacks, hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. The Company's risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, its plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and its plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve its customers. The Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business and relies on third parties and affiliates to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. This includes the utilization of a data center in Mexico. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company's information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nThird parties and affiliates provide key components of the Company's business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or affiliates or any failure of these third parties or affiliates to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver products and services to clients, its reputation and its ability to otherwise conduct business. Beginning in 2011, the Bank began converting to a new core banking system. Implementation and continuing improvement of this new core banking system relies heavily on third parties to develop software.\nTechnological or financial difficulties of a third party or affiliate service provider, including security breaches, could adversely affect the Company's business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party or the loss of sensitive customer data. Further, in some instances the Company may be responsible for failures of such third parties or affiliates to comply with government regulations. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party or affiliate failures and the Company's insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company business infrastructure could interrupt operations or increase the costs of doing business.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal risk and regulatory and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal, regulatory and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, including unauthorized transactions by employees, or operational errors, such as clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from the Company's actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. In addition, negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Company can result in negative public opinion about its other business. Negative public opinion could also affect the Company's credit ratings, which are important to its access to unsecured wholesale borrowings.\nThe Company's business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and business customer data. If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in its possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company's systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nBecause the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company's necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and its large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, such as computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters,\nor other damage to property or physical assets which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations, or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as it is, and to the risk that the Company's, or its vendors', business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of the Company to operate its business, as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the expertise of key personnel, and its operations may suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nThe Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves is great and it may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. If the Company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition.\nIn June 2010, the federal banking regulators issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization's incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. The federal banking regulators and SEC proposed such rules in April 2011. If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, the Company's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the company.\nThe Company's risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework's underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's financial reporting controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or fraud.\nFinancial reporting disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Any disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by any unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages. It may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud or certain breaches of its servicing agreements, and this could harm the Company's liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company originates and often sells mortgage loans. When it sells mortgage loans, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, the Company is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The Company's whole loan sale agreements require it to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event that it breaches certain of these representations or warranties. In addition, the Company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. Likewise, the Company is required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if it breaches a representation or warranty in connection with its securitizations,\nwhether or not it was the originator of the loan. While in many cases it may have a remedy available against certain parties, often these may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against it, and the Company faces the further risk that such parties may not have the financial capacity to satisfy remedies that may be available to it. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces its remedies against it, the Company may not be able to recover its losses from third parties. The Company has received repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers. These have resulted in an increase in the amount of losses for repurchases. While the Company has taken steps to enhance its underwriting policies and procedures, these steps will not reduce risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, the Company's results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to intense competition in the financial services industry, particularly in its market area, which could result in losing business or margin declines.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation. The Company faces aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking, and may acquire banks and other financial institutions. This may significantly change the competitive environment in which the Company conducts business. Some of the Company's competitors have greater financial resources and/or face fewer regulatory constraints. As a result of these various sources of competition, the Company could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect its profitability.\nSome of the Company's larger competitors, including certain national banks that have a significant presence in its market area, may have greater capital and resources than the Company, may have higher lending limits and may offer products and services not offered by the Company. Although the Company remains strong, stable and well capitalized, management cannot predict the reaction of customers and other third parties with which it conducts business with respect to the strength of the Company relative to its competitors, including its larger competitors. Any potential adverse reactions to the Company's financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit its ability to attract and retain customers and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside of its market area. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and may thus be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer who can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This \u201cdisintermediation\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect the Company's operations, and the Company may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nUnpredictable catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornados, terrorist attacks and other large scale catastrophes could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company has operations and customers in the southern United States, which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes and other severe weather in those regions. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Company in that such events could materially disrupt its operations or the ability or willingness of its customers to access the financial services it offers. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although the Company carries insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, these events could nevertheless reduce its earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or results of operations.\nCustomers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing the Company to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of client deposits could decrease if customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, provide superior expected returns. When clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, the Company can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing its funding costs.\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company's reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.\nAs a financial institution, the Company's earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. The reputation of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the financial services industry, including mortgage foreclosure issues. Negative public opinion regarding the Company could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by it to meet its clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, breach of sensitive customer information, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. The Company could also be adversely affected by negative public opinion involving BBVA. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to keep, attract and/or retain clients and personnel, and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by one of the Company's businesses can result in negative public opinion about its other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect the Company's credit ratings, which are important to accessing unsecured wholesale borrowings. Significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources of funding.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules involve significant cost and effort.\nThe Company is subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical problems. Although we believe that our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we cannot guarantee that our anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing. Any of such events may have severe consequences, including sanctions, fines and reputational consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 22032, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BBVA1"}
