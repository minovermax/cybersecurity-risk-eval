{"cik": "1378992", "company": "BERRY GLOBAL GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur substantial indebtedness could affect our ability to meet our obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development and other corporate requirements;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing our business through acquisitions.\nIn addition, the credit agreements and indentures governing our current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which will impose operating and financial restrictions on the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things incur or guarantee additional debt, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, repurchase shares, create or incur certain liens, make certain investments, engage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, transfer all or substantially all of its or their respective assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions, and make capital expenditures. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates which may have an adverse impact on us.\nLIBOR is an interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for a wide range of financial transactions, including derivatives and loans. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what reference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after\n2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to LIBOR. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. We have material borrowing contracts (including our senior secured credit facilities) and derivatives that are indexed to LIBOR. At this time, we cannot predict the future impact of a departure from LIBOR as a reference rate, however, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates as currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in resin prices or a shortage of available resin could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nTo produce our products, we use large quantities of plastic resins. Plastic resins are subject to price fluctuations, including those arising from supply shortages and changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other petrochemical intermediates from which resins are produced. Raw material inflation could materially affect our revenue and profitability in the short term as we attempt to pass through price increases to our customers and in the long term as our customers could seek alternative solutions. We may not be able to arrange for other sources of resin in the event of an industry-wide general shortage of resins used by us, or a shortage or discontinuation of certain types of grades of resin purchased from one or more of our suppliers. Any such shortage may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source resin.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully and our customers may not continue to purchase our products.\nWe compete with multiple companies in each of our product lines on the basis of a number of considerations, including price, service, quality, product characteristics and the ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner. Our products also compete with metal, glass, paper, cloth, and other materials. Some of these competitive products are not subject to the impact of changes in resin prices, which may have a significant and negative impact on our competitive position versus substitute products. Our competitors may have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be better able than us to withstand higher costs. Competition could result in our products losing market share or our having to reduce our prices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since we do not have long-term arrangements with many of our customers, these competitive factors could cause our customers to shift suppliers and/or packaging material quickly. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond timely to customer and market changes.\nWe may pursue and execute acquisitions or divestitures, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we consider transactions that either complement or expand our existing business and create economic value. Transactions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or carving-out divested businesses, which may result in substantial costs, delays or other problems that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not realize all of the synergies we expect to achieve from our current strategic initiatives due to a variety of risks. If we are unable to achieve the benefits that we expect to achieve from our strategic initiatives, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these transactions may result in our attention being diverted from our ongoing operations, which may have a negative impact on our business.\nUncertainty regarding the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cUK\u201d) withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and the outcome of future arrangements between the UK and the EU could have a material adverse impact on us.\nFollowing the UK\u2019s referendum vote to leave the EU in June 2016 (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), the UK government formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave the EU. The UK will remain a member of the EU until the date on which a withdrawal agreement comes into force. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the UK and the EU could have a material adverse effect on business activity (including the buying behavior of commercial and individual customers), the political stability and economic conditions in the UK, the EU and elsewhere. Furthermore, lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations, as the UK determines which EU laws and regulations to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal, may increase costs associated with operating in either or both of the UK and Europe. However, until the UK ceases to be a Member State of the EU, the UK remains a full Member State of the EU and all the rights and obligations of EU membership remain in force.\nAny of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on economic growth or business activity in the UK, the Eurozone, or the EU, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, political systems or financial institutions and the financial and monetary system. Following the consummation of the RPC acquisition, a significant portion of our revenues will be generated in the UK and EU. Consequently, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nCurrent and future environmental and other governmental requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nWhile we have not been required historically to make significant capital expenditures in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. Furthermore, violations or contaminated sites that we do not know about (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or newly discovered information) could result in additional compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material. In addition, federal, state, local, and foreign governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, plastic products. Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of plastic and other containers, and would require diversion of solid waste such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced. Although we believe that any such laws promulgated to date have not had a material adverse effect on us, there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulation would not have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, a decline in consumer preference for plastic products due to environmental considerations could result in significant losses. See \u201cEnvironmental Matters and Government Regulation.\u201d\nIn the event of a catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities, our business would be adversely affected.\nWhile we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could result in significant losses.\nEmployee slowdowns or strikes or the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our business.\nWe may not be able to maintain constructive relationships with labor unions or trade councils. We may not be able to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms in the future. The loss of a substantial number of these employees or a prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business and result in significant losses.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, and cyber threats, system inadequacies, and failures could harm our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of information technology systems and networks. These systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including cybersecurity threats, energy interruptions, telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions, and random attacks. To date, system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on the business. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that could result in significant losses.\nGoodwill and other intangibles represent a significant amount of our net worth, and a future write-off could result in lower reported net income and a reduction of our net worth.\nFuture changes in market multiples, cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write off goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets for the amount of impairment. If a future write-off is required, the charge could result in significant losses.\nOur international operations pose risks to our business that may not be present with our domestic operations.\nForeign operations are subject to certain risks that are unique to doing business in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, economic or political instability, shipping delays in our products and receiving delays of raw materials, changes in applicable laws, including assessments of income and non-income related taxes, reduced protection of intellectual property, inability to readily repatriate cash to the U.S. effectively, and regulatory policies and various trade restrictions including potential changes to export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products from these countries. Any of these risks could disrupt our business and result in significant losses. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. We have implemented safeguards, training and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards, training and policies to assure compliance and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, debarment from export privileges and penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.\nIn addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could result in significant losses.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level following the RPC acquisition, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business, and the trading prices of our securities.\nAs we grow our business or acquire other businesses, including RPC, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Historically, RPC was not subject to the requirement to obtain an attestation report from its independent registered public accounting firm on effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Our evaluation and remediation of assessed deficiencies, if any, over internal controls could require us to incur significant expense.", "PERMNO": 13604, "SIC": 3080, "TIC": "BERY"}
