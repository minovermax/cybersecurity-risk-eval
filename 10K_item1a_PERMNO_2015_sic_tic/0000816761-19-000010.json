{"cik": "816761", "company": "TERADATA CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Annual Report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or occurrences, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nImplementation of Strategy and Business Transformation - The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our business transformation plan and execution of our new strategy including transition to new business focus areas and delivery models, revenue streams, sales structures, talent management restructuring, and cost rationalization initiatives could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe successful implementation of our strategy and completion of our business transformation presents organizational and infrastructure challenges. We may not be able to implement and realize the anticipated benefits from our strategy or our business transformation plan. Events and circumstances, such as financial or unforeseen difficulties, delays and unexpected costs, may occur that could result in our not realizing desired outcomes. Any failure to implement the transformation of the Company in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized, there may be consequences, internal control issues, or business impacts that were not expected. Additionally, because of our restructuring efforts in connection with our business transformation plan, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all the expected benefits of these activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs part of our strategy, our business is shifting from traditional, perpetual pricing and revenue to a subscription-based model in which less revenue is recognized upfront at the time the customer enters into a transaction. The pace and extent to which customers will purchase our offerings on a subscription basis is variable and therefore has impacts on our results and operations. In addition, it is uncertain whether these new offerings and deployment models will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary business models, infrastructure and systems to support the business. This includes having or hiring the right talent to execute our business strategy in a competitive job market. Market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirements, and to optimally price our offerings and services to meet customer demand and cover our costs. Our go-to-market strategy also must adjust to customers' changing buying preferences, and there can be no assurance that our go-to-market approach will adequately and completely address such preferences. New product and services offerings may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. For example, with our cloud-based offerings, market acceptance is affected by a variety of factors including information security, reliability, performance, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our offerings and services in certain geographies, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data as well as the customer's ability to access this data once a contract has expired, and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the\nenactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers. If we are unable to correctly respond to these issues, our business could be harmed.\nInformation Systems and Security - A breach of security, disruption, or failure of our information systems or those of our third-party providers could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases (and the computer equipment and database information of certain suppliers and other third parties) from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, cyber-attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusions, malicious or unintended insider actions that cause loss of data or loss of systems, including phishing schemes, and other events. Despite our contingency planning, events of this nature may still result in system failures and other interruptions in our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHistorically, we generally have operated pursuant to a business-to-business model, such that our customers buy or lease hardware systems used in connection with our software solutions and the customers deploy and operate those solutions. With respect to these types of customer on-premises solutions, the customer, directly or through its selected services providers, manages all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential, private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions, including any personally identifiable data or information - such as non-public data regarding our customers\u2019 employees, customers' customers, consumers, data subjects, individuals\u2019 identities, individual financial accounts and health information including, for example, information that is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. However, some of our services, including our software-as-a-service or cloud offerings, may require us to deploy or operate solutions for our customers, directly or through the use of third-party services providers, either on-premises at customer-selected data center facilities, or at third-party-hosted data center facilities selected by us. With respect to these cloud and software-as-a-service offerings, we and such service providers have increased roles, responsibilities and risk exposures regarding some or all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential, private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions on our systems or those of selected third-party providers. If unauthorized access to or use of such information or systems occurs, despite data security measures and third-party commitments to protect them, our results of operation, reputation, and relationships with our customers could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, experienced computer programmers, Nation State Sponsored Advanced Persistent Code (\u201cNSSAPC\u201d) attackers (from countries such as Iran, China and certain European Eastern Bloc countries) and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or that of our third-party providers and misappropriate or compromise our intellectual property or other confidential information or that of our customers, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our offerings or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our offerings. In addition, phishing-scheme-perpetrators may be able to lure employees or contractors into providing such perpetrators with information that may enable them to avoid some of our network security controls or those of third-party providers which could result in system disruptions or a loss of confidential and proprietary information.\nWe have been subject to actual and potential cyber-attacks previously, although we have not experienced a material adverse impact in connection with these incidents. Even though our preventative and remediation tools and actions may have mitigated or preempted these actual and potential attacks, we continue to take additional steps, including investing in additional protections, designed to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems; however, there can be no assurance that our defensive measures will be adequate to prevent them in the future. Also, like many other companies, our workstations are regularly subject to penetration attempts and malicious threats by hackers and our employees and contractors are regularly subject to phishing attempts by phishing-scheme-perpetrators. Despite our defensive measures, we may not always be able to detect, mitigate or preempt them all. Breaches of security and disruptions of our information systems have not historically had a material impact on our results of operations and we have no reason to believe that attempts by hackers and phishing-scheme-perpetrators such as those described above have negatively impacted our IT infrastructure, operations, confidential information or intellectual property. However, there is risk that these types of activities will recur and persist, that one or more of them may be successful in the future, that one or more of them may have been or will be successful but not detected, prevented, remediated or mitigated by us, and the costs to us to eliminate, detect, prevent, remediate, mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, viruses, worms, malicious software programs, phishing\nschemes and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could adversely impact our future results of operations.\nRenewal Rates and Support Services - If our existing customers fail to renew or cancel their subscription license arrangements or support agreements, or if customers do not license updates to software offerings on terms favorable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nTeradata\u2019s solution offerings have been expanded to include a variety of subscription options, which impact the timing of when revenues are recognized and related cash flow are collected. Additionally, future revenue streams and cash flows could be adversely affected if customers do not renew or cancel their subscription arrangements.\nIn addition, we currently derive a significant portion of our overall revenues from maintenance services and unspecified when-and-if-available software upgrades (collectively referred to as \"support\"), and we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue and cash flow from support services. The terms of our standard support arrangements generally provide for the prepayment of first-year support fees and are generally renewable on an annual basis. Our contracts also include cancellation provisions. The IT industry generally has been experiencing increasing pricing pressure from customers when purchasing or renewing support agreements. Mergers and acquisitions in certain industries that we serve could result in a reduction of the software and hardware being supported and put pressure on our subscription and support terms with customers who have merged. Given this environment, there can be no assurance that our current customers will renew their subscription and/or support agreements or agree to the same terms when they renew, which could result in our reducing or losing subscription and/or support fees which could adversely impact operating results.\nAdvancement of Our Solutions - We need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions in a competitive, demanding, and rapidly changing environment.\nTo succeed in the intensely competitive IT industry, we must continually improve, refresh and expand our product and service offerings to include newer features, functionality, and deployment options and to keep pace with price-to-performance gains in the IT industry. Shortened product life cycles due to customer demands and competitive pressures impact the pace at which we must introduce and implement new technology. This requires a high level of innovation by both our software developers and the suppliers of the third-party software components included in our solutions. In addition, bringing new solutions to the market entails a costly and lengthy process, and requires us to accurately anticipate customer needs and technology trends. We must continue to respond to market demands, develop leading technologies and maintain leadership in analytic data solutions performance and scalability, or our business operations may be adversely affected.\nWe must also anticipate and respond to customer demands regarding the compatibility of our current and prior offerings. These demands could hinder the pace of adopting and implementing new technology. Our future results may be affected if our offerings cannot effectively interface and perform well with software offerings of other companies and with our customers\u2019 existing IT infrastructures, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enter into agreements allowing integration of third-party technology with the Teradata software platforms. Our efforts to develop the interoperability of our offerings may require significant investments of capital and employee resources. In addition, many of our principal offerings are used with offerings offered by third parties and, in the future, some vendors of non-Teradata offerings may become less willing to provide us with access to their offerings, technical information and marketing and sales support.\nBecause of these and other factors, our ability to introduce new or improved solutions could be adversely impacted. There can be no assurance that our innovations will be profitable, and if we cannot successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions, our business and operating results could be impacted. If we were to lose our significant technology advantage, our market share and growth could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to deliver our solutions, features, and functionality as projected, we may be unable to meet our commitments to customers, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our R&D efforts in order to maintain and advance our competitive position, including our initiatives to provide our offerings for cloud environments. However, we may not receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. Research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our discretionary fixed costs. If we invest in R&D inappropriately, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHighly Advanced Offerings - Our offerings include highly advanced technology, and, as we develop new offerings with greater capacity and performance capabilities, the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these offerings increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems.\nOur software and hardware offerings may contain undetected errors or security flaws, which may be found after the offerings are introduced and delivered. This risk is enhanced when offerings are first introduced or when new versions are released, as well as when we develop offerings with more advanced technology, since the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these offerings increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems. Additionally, we integrate third-party components that may have quality issues and may impact our performance. The correction and detection of errors may cause delays, lost revenues and incremental costs. Errors in our software offerings could also affect the ability of our offerings to work with other software or hardware offerings, could delay the development or release of new offerings or new versions of offerings, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our offerings. While we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment, we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors.\nOur customers who rely on our solutions for business-critical applications are more sensitive to errors, which could expose us to liability, performance and warranty claims, as well as harm our reputation. These and other risks associated with new offerings may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and future performance.\nSales Cycle Variations - Unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles or shifts between subscription and perpetual purchasing options makes accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nAlthough we are seeing a shift to customers purchasing subscription-based contracts, we still expect some customers will continue to purchase some or all of the components of our solutions on a perpetual basis, especially hardware. The size, deal mix and timing of large orders for our offerings and services varies considerably, which can impact results from quarter to quarter. The process we use to forecast sales and trends in our business relies heavily on estimates of closure on a transaction-specific basis. It is very difficult to predict sales in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time. Unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles make accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, including the pace at which our customers move to the new subscription-based offerings.\nThe length of our sales cycle varies depending on several factors over which we may have little or no control, including the size and complexity of a potential transaction, the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities and our current and potential customers\u2019 internal budgeting and approval process, as well as overall macro-economic conditions. Because of a generally long sales cycle, we may expend significant effort over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order, but ultimately not complete the sale, or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated. Our revenue from different customers varies from quarter to quarter, and a customer with a large order in one quarter may generate significantly lower revenue in subsequent periods. Historically, our results in any particular quarter have generally been dependent on the timing of a relatively small number of large transactions.\nOur business model is based on our anticipated mix of software and hardware and the corresponding profit margins for such software and hardware. Unfavorable shifts in such mix could adversely impact our results of operations and require changes to our business model. Consulting services margins are generally lower than the other elements of our analytic data solutions. In addition, when we use third parties to supplement some consulting services we provide to customers, this generally results in lower margin rates. As a result, increases in consulting services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues may decrease overall margins.\nIn the near term, we expect revenue growth to be impacted as we transition to subscription-based offerings where revenue is recognized over time. This shift has an impact on margins and cash flow as we have less upfront revenue and cash collected than from our traditional perpetual sales.\nIn addition, we also realize different margins on the various offerings we provide, as well as certain components we re-sell as part of our solutions, and the mix of such hardware and software varies from quarter to quarter depending on customer requirements. In addition, changes in the price and performance of our analytic data platforms, particularly for certain hardware components, could negatively impact maintenance and support services revenues. Additionally, as we implement part of our strategy and shift from upfront perpetual licenses to subscription-based,\nrecurring over time models for both on-premises and cloud offerings, our revenue mix will be impacted. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, margins, and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.\nIn addition, the budgeting and spending cycles of our customers and potential customers make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results. Spending has historically been heavy in our fourth quarter because of large enterprise customers placing orders before the expiration of budgets tied to that calendar year.\nOur operating expense budgets (including such categories as headcount, real estate, and technology resources) are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter. Since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, failure to generate projected revenues for a specified period could adversely impact our operating results, reducing net income or causing an operating loss for that period. The deferral or non-occurrence of such sales revenues could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter and could negatively impact our business in future periods.\nDependence on Key Employees - We depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nOur employees and access to talent are critical to our success. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of senior management and key personnel in all functional areas of our Company, including engineering and development, marketing and sales professionals, and consultants. Competition for highly skilled personnel and acquired talent in the IT industry is intense. No assurance can be made that key personnel will remain with us, and it may be difficult and costly to replace such employees and/or obtain qualified talent who are not employees. Our failure to hire, retain and replace our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business operations.\nInternational Operations - Generating substantial revenues from our international operations poses several risks.\nIn 2018, the percentage of our total revenues from outside of the United States was 53%. We have exposure to more than 30 functional currencies. We believe that our geographic diversity helps to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations. These risks include adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, deteriorating economic environments, business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties as well as corruption and security risks, including the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and political conditions in each country that could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets;\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations that could result in lower demand for our offerings as well as generate currency translation losses;\n\u2022\nCurrency fluctuations can affect margins on sales of our offerings in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of offerings that include components sourced in the United States but sold outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nThe impact of civil and political unrest (relating to war, terrorist activity or other turmoil) on the economy or markets in general, or on our ability, or that of our suppliers, to meet commitments, which may occur in other countries where we have significant operations;\n\u2022\nCultural and management challenges associated with operating in developing countries;\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nTariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment; and\n\u2022\nThe impact of catastrophic weather or other negative effects of climate change on our facilities, operations and/or workforce, as well as those of our customers, supply chains and distribution channels, throughout the world, particularly those in coastal areas.\nOur offerings are subject to United States export controls and, when exported from the United States, or re-exported to another country, must be authorized under applicable United States export regulations. Changes in our offerings\nor changes in export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our offerings in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our offerings throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our offerings to certain countries or customers altogether. Any change in export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our offerings by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our offerings to, existing or potential customers with international operations.\nThere is active enforcement and ongoing focus by the SEC and other governmental authorities on the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d) and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws in other countries. Given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees, despite our high ethics, governance and compliance standards, which could put the Company at risk regarding possible violations of such laws, including the FCPA or the Bribery Act, and could result in various civil or criminal fines, penalties or administrative sanctions, and related costs, which could negatively impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nEconomic Pressures and Uncertainty - Our business is affected by the global economies in which we operate and the economic climate of the industries we serve.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. In particular, the IT industry in which we operate is susceptible to significant changes in the strength of the economy and the financial health of companies and governmental entities that make spending commitments for new technologies. Accordingly, global economic and market conditions, including certain economic sectors (such as retail, manufacturing, financial services or government) may adversely impact our business. For example, adverse changes to the economy could impact the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, decreased or more closely scrutinized spending in our customers\u2019 businesses and in the industries we serve, may adversely impact our business. Uncertainty about future economic conditions may make it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Accordingly, global economic and market conditions may cause material impacts on our results of operations, prospects and financial condition. The Company\u2019s success in periods of economic uncertainty may also be dependent, in part, on our ability to reduce costs in response to changes in demand and other activity.\nLegal Contingencies and Regulatory Matters - We face uncertainties regarding lawsuits, regulations and other related matters.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters, including those that relate to the environment, health and safety, employee benefits, export compliance, intellectual property, a variety of local laws and regulations and other regulatory compliance and general matters. See \u201cNote 10-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties, their outcomes are not predictable. While we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate considering the probable and estimable liabilities, there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations, including those relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and reporting, which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future. From time to time, we may conduct internal investigations in connection with our efforts to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations, the costs or results of which could impact our financial results. In addition, we may be subject to unexpected costs in connection with new public disclosure or other regulatory requirements that are issued from time to time. Laws and regulations impacting our customers, such as those relating to privacy, data protection and digital marketing, could also impact our future business. Because we do business in the government sector, we are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil or criminal fines, penalties or administrative sanctions, including debarment from future government business, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, our facilities and operations, including former facilities and former operations for which we may have liabilities, are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws. There can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not adversely impact future operating results.\nThere is active enforcement and ongoing focus by the SEC and other governmental authorities on the FCPA and the Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws in other countries. Given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees, despite our high ethics, governance and compliance standards, which could put the Company at risk regarding possible violations of such laws, including the FCPA or the Bribery Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nManagement time and resources are spent to understand and comply with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to such matters as corporate governance, accounting principles, public disclosure, SEC regulations, Basel III and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) where our shares are listed. Although we do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations, rapid changes in accounting standards, and federal securities laws and regulations, among others, may substantially increase costs to our organization, challenge our ability to timely comply with all of them and could have an impact on our future operating results.\nPrivacy concerns and laws such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and services and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. In some cases, new data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation that took effect in May 2018 and an amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information in Japan, impose new obligations directly on the Company as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. These new laws may require us to make changes to our solutions and services to enable Teradata and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. Further, laws such as the European Union\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals\u2019 online activities. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions and services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our solutions and services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and services, reduce overall demand for our solutions and services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our solutions and services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as related ISO standards. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.\nFurthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers\u2019 customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our solutions and services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy\nof personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our offerings or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\nCompetition - The IT industry is intensely competitive and evolving, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our pricing practices or demand for our offerings and services.\nWe operate in the intensely competitive IT industry, which is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and models for consuming and delivering business and IT services, frequent new product introductions, and frequent price and cost reductions. In general, as a participant in the analytic data solutions market, we face:\n\u2022\nChanges in customer IT spending preferences and other shifts in market demands, which drive changes in the Company's competition;\n\u2022\nContinued pressure on price/performance for analytic data platform solutions due to constant technology improvements in processor capacity and speed;\n\u2022\nChanges in pricing, marketing and product strategies, such as potential aggressive price discounting and the use of different pricing models by our competitors;\n\u2022\nRapid changes in computing technology and capabilities that challenge our ability to maintain differentiation at the lower range of business intelligence analytic functions;\n\u2022\nNew and emerging analytic technologies, competitors, and business models;\n\u2022\nContinued emergence of open source software that often rivals current technology offerings at a much lower cost despite its limited functionality;\n\u2022\nRapid changes in product delivery models, such as on-premises solutions versus cloud solutions;\n\u2022\nChanging competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets; and\n\u2022\nContinuing trend toward consolidation of companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete, including if our key partners merge or partner with our competitors.\nTo compete successfully in this environment, we must rapidly and continually design, develop and market solutions and related offerings and services that are valued in the marketplace. To do this, we must react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands. Our market position depends on our ability to continually improve the delivery models and price/performance of our solutions, while maintaining efficient operations to sustain our competitive operating margins. We must also maintain the quality of our offerings and services throughout these shifts in market demand. If we are unable to react quickly when and as needed to improve the value of our product offerings our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur competitors include certain larger companies, such as IBM, Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and Amazon, which are well-capitalized companies with widespread distribution, brand recognition and penetration of platforms and service offerings. The significant purchasing and market power of these larger competitors, which have greater financial resources than we do, could allow them to surpass our market penetration and marketing efforts to promote and sell their offerings and services. In addition, many other companies participate in specific areas of our business, such as enterprise applications, analytic platforms and business intelligence software. In some cases, we may partner with a company in one area of our business and compete with them in another. The status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete for analytic data solutions opportunities in such areas. We also expect additional competition from both established and emerging companies. Failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors in these and other areas could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate additional revenues or sustain existing revenue levels.\nInternal Controls - Inadequate internal control over financial reporting and accounting practices could lead to errors, which could adversely impact our ability to assure timely and accurate financial reporting.\nInternal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives will be met. These inherent limitations include system errors, the potential for human error and unauthorized actions of employees or contractors, inadequacy of controls, temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight or resources, and other factors. Consequently, such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under SEC and\nNYSE rules, which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business. Controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances, and it is necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time. In addition, unforeseen risks may arise in connection with financial reporting systems due to inefficient business processes, business process reengineering projects, or changes in accounting standards.\nIf management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment, material weaknesses could occur, causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could lead to a decline in our stock price, limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future, and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.\nIntellectual Property - Inadequate protection of Teradata\u2019s intellectual property or infringement of intellectual property that is owned by others could impact our business and financial condition.\nAs a technology company, our intellectual property portfolio is crucial to our continuing ability to be a leading analytic solutions provider. We strive to protect and enhance our proprietary intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as through technological safeguards. These efforts include protection of the offerings and application, diagnostic and other software we develop.\nTo the extent we are not successful our business could be materially adversely impacted. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization or independently developing technology that is similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States (such as Iran, China and certain European Eastern Bloc countries who may use NSSAPC to advance their own industries). With respect to our pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims, and our competitors may already have applied for patents that, once issued, will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our offerings.\nWhile we take steps to provide for confidentiality obligations of employees and third parties with whom we do business (including customers, suppliers and strategic partners), there is a risk that such parties will breach such obligations and jeopardize our intellectual property rights. Many customers have outsourced the administration and management of their data warehouses to third parties, including some of our competitors, who then have access to our confidential information. Although we have agreements in place to mitigate this risk, there can be no assurance that such protections will be sufficient. In addition, our ability to capture and re-use field-based developed intellectual property is important to future business opportunities and margins.\nWe have seen a trend towards aggressive enforcement of intellectual property rights as the functionality of offerings in our industry increasingly overlaps and the volume of issued software patents continues to grow. As a result, there is a risk that we could be subject to infringement claims which, regardless of their validity, could:\n\u2022\nBe expensive, time consuming and divert management attention away from normal business operations;\n\u2022\nRequire us to pay monetary damages or enter into non-standard royalty and licensing agreements;\n\u2022\nRequire us to modify our product sales and development plans; or\n\u2022\nRequire us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nRegardless of whether these claims have any merit, they can be burdensome to defend or settle and can harm our business and reputation.\nReliance on Third Parties - Our future results depend in part on our relationships with key suppliers, strategic partners and other third parties.\nOur development, marketing and distribution strategies depend in part on our ability to form strategic alliances with third parties that have complementary offerings, software, services and skills. Our strategic partners include consultants and system integrators, software and technology providers, and indirect channel distributors in certain countries. These relationships create risks including our control of our partners changing their business focus, entering strategic alliances with other companies, being acquired by our competitors, failing to meet performance criteria or improperly using our confidential information. If we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with strategic partners, or if we are forced to seek alternative technology, or technology for new solutions, that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms our business may be adversely affected.\nThird-party vendors provide important elements to our solutions; if we do not maintain our relationships with these vendors or if these vendors cease to be going concerns, interruptions in the supply of our offerings may result. There are some components of our solutions that we purchase from single sources due to price, quality, technology or other reasons. For example, we have relied on Flex as a key single source contract manufacturer for our hardware systems for the last several years. In addition, we buy silicon computer chips and microprocessors from Intel Corporation, and storage disk systems from NetApp, Inc. Some components supplied by third parties may be critical to our solutions, and several of our suppliers may terminate their agreements with us without cause with 180-days notice. If we were unable to purchase necessary services, parts, components or offerings from a particular vendor and had to find an alternative supplier, our shipments and deliveries could be delayed. Also, quality issues, a disruption in our supply chain or the need to find alternative suppliers could impact the costs and/or timing associated with procuring necessary offerings, components and services. In any case, our operations could be adversely impacted. Similarly, our suppliers\u2019 offerings and services have certain dependencies with respect to their own supply chain networks, and supply issues among our suppliers\u2019 suppliers may also adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, smaller suppliers have operating risks that could impact our business. These risks could create product time delays, inventory and invoicing problems, staging delays, and other operational difficulties. We could also be impacted by their inability to provide high-quality offerings or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nDemand for the offerings and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.\nWe operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. Operational factors such as, for example, failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation.\nExternal factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in customer loyalty, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability.\nChanging Tax Rates - A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; and changes in available tax credits, especially surrounding tax credits in the United States for our research and development activities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition.\nChanges in United States or international tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, on December 22, 2017 the United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which included broad and complex changes to the way multinational corporations are taxed in the United States. The legislation is highly complex and unclear in certain respects, and will require interpretations, technical clarifications and/or amendments by the IRS and state tax authorities, which could change the amounts recorded in prior periods and/or our projections of our forward-looking effective tax rate. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including an increase in tax audit activity in certain jurisdictions to address \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.\nOperating Result and Stock Price Fluctuations - Our financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results and adversely affect our stock price.\nOur quarterly and annual financial results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to several factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our results have historically been subject to seasonal buying patterns and the timing of transactions in a particular quarter. For example, if transactions that we expect to close by the end of a quarter are not closed until a later date or shifts between perpetual and subscription, our revenue and/or net income for that quarter could be substantially below expectations, especially given the large size of our transactions. As our business is shifting to more subscription-based transactions, it is difficult to predict the pace at which we expect to move to a subscription-based model and we could still see a portion of our revenues recognized on a perpetual, upfront basis. These and any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us not to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations. The resulting failure to meet market expectations could cause a decrease in our stock price. These factors include, among other things, the risks discussed elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\u2022\nThe speed at which customers move to our subscription-based offerings;\n\u2022\nDownturns in our customers\u2019 businesses, in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business;\n\u2022\nThe size, timing and contractual terms of large orders for our offerings and services, which may impact our quarterly operating results (either positively or negatively);\n\u2022\nThe budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers;\n\u2022\nChanges in pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures, such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors, new pricing strategies, or other factors;\n\u2022\nChanges in how customers prefer to purchase analytical solutions;\n\u2022\nChanges in the mix of pre-tax earnings attributable to domestic versus international sales;\n\u2022\nUnexpected needs for capital expenditures or other unanticipated expenses; and\n\u2022\nChanges in certain assumptions, estimates and judgments of management (which are required in connection with the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements) that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities.\nIn addition, although changing with our movement to subscription-based transactions, fluctuations in seasonal buying patterns can result in lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year, which also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing and mix of product sales. Furthermore, revenue and deal volume in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months, which further impacts our ability to predict financial results accurately and enhances the enterprise risks inherent in our business. These and other factors make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately.\nAll the above risk factors could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. Additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them.\nUnited Kingdom Operations - Risks Relating to the Referendum of the United Kingdom\u2019s Membership of the European Union\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (\"Brexit\"). In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw and withdrawal negotiations began in June 2017. The United Kingdom is currently scheduled to exit the European Union on March 29, 2019. The long-term nature of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when and the extent to which any relationship will\nbe agreed and implemented. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, capital, data and people between the United Kingdom, the European Union, and elsewhere. The full effect of Brexit is uncertain and depends on any agreements the United Kingdom may make to retain access to European Union markets. The ongoing uncertainty could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance.\nAlliances and Acquisitions - Our ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions and effectively manage alliances may be an important element of future growth.\nWe are continually evaluating the most effective ways to extend Teradata\u2019s core technology and expand our analytic platforms and solutions to address multiple market segments and solution offerings. From time to time, this includes acquisitions, equity investments or joint ventures. Our operating results may fluctuate because of acquisitions and related integration activities, as well as other strategic growth transactions, and there is a risk that our financial results may be adversely affected. Such transactions entail various risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nAssimilating and integrating different business operations, corporate cultures, personnel, infrastructure and technologies or offerings acquired or licensed;\n\u2022\nRetaining key employees and maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nRecurring revenue of the acquired company may decline or fail to be renewed;\n\u2022\nThe potential for unknown liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, compliance or quality issues within the acquired or combined business or additional costs not anticipated at the time of acquisition;\n\u2022\nDisruptions of our ongoing business or inability to successfully incorporate acquired products, services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve the projected synergies after integration of acquired companies or a decline in value of the acquired business and related impairments;\n\u2022\nFunding acquisition activities, whether through existing cash reserves, or through the use of debt, and the related impact on our liquidity and financial condition; and\n\u2022\nFailure to realize all the economic benefits from these acquisitions, equity investments or joint ventures could result in an impairment of goodwill, intangible assets or other assets, which could result in a significant adverse impact to our results of operations.\nOur strategic partnerships with Amazon and Microsoft for our IntelliCloud offerings on their AWS and Azure public clouds, require significant investments to ensure that our solutions are optimized in these cloud environments. If we are unsuccessful in meeting performance requirements or obtaining future returns on these investments, our financial results may be adversely impacted.\nIndebtedness - Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our financial flexibility.\nThe Company's indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nExpose us to interest rate risk;\n\u2022\nIncrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing at attractive rates;\n\u2022\nRequire the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u2022\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt.\nFurther, our outstanding indebtedness is subject to financial and other covenants, which may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control. If we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness, we may be in default under the loan, which may entitle the lenders to accelerate the debt obligations. To avoid defaulting on our indebtedness, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital, any of which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.", "PERMNO": 92293, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TDC"}
