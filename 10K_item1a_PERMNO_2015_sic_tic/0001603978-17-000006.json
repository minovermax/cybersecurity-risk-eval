{"cik": "1603978", "company": "AquaBounty Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for information relating to these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe have a history of net losses and will likely incur future losses, at least during the next five years, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nAlthough we were established in 1991, we did not start to develop our current product portfolio until 1996. In the period since incorporation to December 31, 2016, we have incurred net losses of approximately $99.3 million. These losses reflect our personnel, research and development, and marketing costs. Management is evaluating several paths to revenue generation that follow different timelines, including production of our fish at our existing farm in Panama, purchase of an existing production facility in North America, and construction of a new production facility in North America. Depending on which path or combination of paths is chosen, modest revenues could commence as early as the fourth quarter of 2017 from our Panama farm with more significant revenues expected once a new facility is in full production. However, the ability to realize revenues and the timing thereof are not certain, and achieving revenues does not assure that we will become profitable.\nWe will need substantial additional capital in the future in order to fund our business.\nWe do not expect significant sales until 2021, at the earliest, and to date we have not generated any profit and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Therefore, based on our current business plan, we anticipate a need to raise further funds. Any issuance of shares of our common stock could have an effect of depressing the market price of shares of our common stock through dilution of earnings per share or otherwise.\nThe amount and timing of the expenditures needed to achieve our development and commercialization programs will depend on numerous factors, some of which are outside our control. Changes in our plans could result in the need for additional funds. The primary factor impacting the amount and timing of any additional expenditures is the timing of the completion of our pilot commercial operation for AquAdvantage Salmon, which is expected to commence in 2017. Until the pilot operation is completed, we will have no sources of revenue and thus will require funds to cover operational losses, which have recently averaged between $7 million and $8 million per year.\nFollowing completion of the pilot commercial operation, we plan to commercialize the product through the channel we determine to be most advantageous to the Company. Such efforts may involve producing AquAdvantage Salmon eggs for commercial production, licensing the technology to salmon growers, and/or growing out the salmon in our own land-based facilities. If we elect to grow-out fish ourselves, we would need to invest in the construction of land based recirculating aquaculture system facilities. These facilities have estimated construction costs of $15 million for each 1,000 metric tons of output. We have begun an active search in both the United States and Canada for either an existing land-based recirculating aquaculture system facility or a site on which to build a new facility for the commercial production of AAS.\nThere can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, or that such funds, if raised, would be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our business strategy.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of holders of our common stock will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding; marketing and distribution arrangements; or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur ability to generate revenue to support our operations depends on obtaining additional regulatory approvals for AquAdvantage Salmon, the receipt of which is uncertain, and the maintenance of existing approvals.\nAs a genetically modified animal for human consumption, AquAdvantage Salmon required approval from the FDA in the United States and the Ministers of Health and Environment in Canada before it could be produced, sold, or consumed in those countries. Our FDA approval covers the production of our eggs in our hatchery in Canada and the grow-out of our eggs in our facility in Panama. FDA approvals will be needed for each additional facility we plan to bring on line. Additionally, we will require local regulatory approvals in other countries in which we hope to operate. There is no guarantee that we will receive or be able to maintain regulatory approvals from the FDA or other regulatory bodies or that there will not be a significant delay before approval. There is also no guarantee that any approvals granted will not be subject to unduly onerous obligations in relation to matters such as production or labeling, or that any regulator will not require additional data prior to approval, which may be costly and time consuming to acquire.\nWe will be required to continue to comply with FDA regulations.\nEven with the approval of the NADA for AquAdvantage Salmon, we must continue to comply with FDA requirements not only for manufacturing, but also for labeling, advertising, record keeping, and reporting to the FDA of adverse events and other information. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to administrative or judicial enforcement actions, including but not limited to product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, refusals to approve new products, or withdrawal of existing approvals, as well as increased product liability exposure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nEthical, legal, and social concerns about genetically modified organisms could limit or prevent the use of our products and limit our revenues.\nOur technologies involve the use of genetically modified organisms. Public perception about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetically engineered products could influence public acceptance of our technologies and products. Activist groups opposing genetic modifications of organisms have in the past pressured a number of retail food outlets and grocery chains to publicly state that they will not carry genetically modified Atlantic salmon. If we are not able to overcome the ethical, legal, and social concerns relating to genetic engineering, products using our technologies may not be accepted in the marketplace, and demand for our products could fall short of what we expect. These concerns could also result in increased expenses, regulatory scrutiny, delays, or other impediments to implementation of our business plan.\nThe subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative publicity, which has aroused public debate. This adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered products. Further, there is a concern that products produced using our technologies could be perceived to cause adverse events, which could also lead to negative publicity.\nWe may have limited success in gaining consumer acceptance of our products.\nThere is an active and vocal group of opponents to genetically modified organisms who wish to ban or restrict the technology and who, at a minimum, hope to sway consumer perceptions and acceptance of this technology. Their efforts include regulatory legal challenges and labeling campaigns for genetically modified products, as well as application of pressure to consumer retail outlets seeking a commitment not to carry genetically modified Atlantic salmon. Consumer acceptance could also be adversely affected if AquAdvantage Salmon were found, or believed, to grow to a larger final size than traditional Atlantic salmon. We may not be able to overcome the negative consumer perceptions that these organizations have instilled against our products.\nWe may be sued by non-governmental organizations and others who are opposed to the development or commercialization of genetically modified organisms.\nThere are many organizations in the United States and elsewhere that are fundamentally opposed to the development of genetically modified organisms. These groups have a history of bringing legal action against companies attempting to bring new biotechnology products to market. On January 16, 2014, an application was filed by two NGOs with the Canadian Federal Court seeking judicial review to declare invalid the decision by the Canadian Minister of the Environment to publish in the Canadian Gazette a Significant New Activity Notice (\u201cSNAN\u201d) with respect to AquAdvantage Salmon. Though the Canadian Federal Court dismissed this challenge, the petitioners filed an appeal of the ruling, which was subsequently dismissed by the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal on October 21, 2016.\nIn the United States, a coalition of NGOs filed a complaint on March 30, 2016, against the FDA, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and related individuals for their roles in the approval of AquAdvantage Salmon, claiming that the FDA had no statutory authority to regulate genetically modified animals, and, if it did, that the agency failed to analyze and implement measures to mitigate ecological, environmental, and socioeconomic risks that could impact wild salmon and the environment, including the risk that AquAdvantage Salmon could escape and threaten endangered wild salmon stocks. Among other things, the claimants are seeking a judgment that the FDA decision to approve AquAdvantage Salmon is not authorized by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFFDCA\u201d); that an injunction be issued requiring the FDA to withdraw its assertion of jurisdiction over animals that contain genetically modified organisms (\u201cGMOs\u201d); that the FDA decision to approve AquAdvantage Salmon and its EA and FONSI determinations be declared in violation of the FFDCA; and that the decision to approve the AquAdvantage Salmon NADA be vacated.\nThough we believe this legal action lacks merit, it is currently ongoing. We may be subject to future litigation brought by one or more of these organizations in their attempt to block the development or sale of our product. In addition, animal rights groups and various other organizations and individuals have attempted to stop genetic engineering activities by pressing for legislation and additional regulation in these areas. To the extent the actions of these organizations are successful, our business may be adversely affected. Such actions, even if unsuccessful, may distract management from its operational priorities and may cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe may have to label our AquAdvantage Salmon at the retail level as containing a genetically modified organism, which could negatively impact consumer acceptance.\nUntil the recent passage of the National Sea Grant College Program Reauthorization in July 2016, which contained the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, or Labeling Act, our AquAdvantage Salmon did not need to be labeled as containing a genetically modified organism, because it had been deemed to be \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the traditional product. However, because several states either passed or considered new laws specifying varying requirements for labeling products sold at the retail level that contain genetically modified ingredients, the United States Congress passed the Labeling Act to establish a national standard for package labeling for foods containing genetically modified ingredients. The United States Department of Agriculture has until July 2018 to implement this new law. Labeling requirements could cause consumers to view the label as either a warning or as an indication that AquAdvantage Salmon is inferior to traditional Atlantic salmon, which could negatively impact consumer acceptance of our product.\nThe markets in which we intend to sell our products are subject to significant regulations.\nIn addition to our FDA approval for the sale and consumption of AquAdvantage Salmon in the United States, we will also be subject to state and local regulations and permitting requirements, which could impact or delay the commercialization and commencement of revenue generation from the sale of AquAdvantage Salmon. International sales are also subject to rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies within foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that foreign, state, or local regulatory bodies will approve the sale of our product in their jurisdiction.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling, disposal of, and human exposure to our products in both the United States and overseas, including regulation by governmental regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations.\nWe may become subject to increasing regulation in the future.\nRegulations pertaining to genetically modified animals are still developing and could change from their present state. We could be subject to increasing or more onerous regulatory hurdles as we attempt to commercialize our product, which could require us to incur significant additional capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. Our regulatory burdens could also increase if AquAdvantage Salmon are found, or believed, to grow to a larger final size than traditional Atlantic salmon.\nAtlantic Salmon farming is restricted in certain states.\nConcerns regarding the possible environmental impact from AquAdvantage Salmon have led Washington and California to impose legislative and regulatory restrictions or bans on its farming. In addition, some states, such as Alaska, have enacted restrictions on Atlantic salmon farming generally. While we currently believe that many states will offer excellent potential sites for AquAdvantage Salmon production systems, if additional states adopt similar restrictions, or otherwise prohibit the rearing of AquAdvantage Salmon in those states, the number of potential sites available to us for production farms in the United States could be reduced.\nThe loss of AquAdvantage Salmon broodstock could result in the loss of our commercial technology.\nOur intellectual property for AquAdvantage Salmon resides in the breeding population of live fish, or broodstock, themselves. Destruction of AquAdvantage Salmon broodstocks by whatever means would result in the loss of the commercial technology. Live animals are subject to disease that may, in some cases, prevent or cause delay in the export of fish or eggs to customers. Disease organisms may be present undetected and transferred inadvertently. In addition, our broodstock is kept at a limited number of facilities, and damage to or failure of critical systems at any one of those facilities could lead to the loss of a substantial percentage of our broodstock. Such events may cause loss of revenue, increased costs, or both.\nAtlantic salmon farming is subject to disease outbreaks, which can increase the cost of production and/or reduce production harvests.\nSalmon farming systems, particularly conventional, open sea-cage systems, are vulnerable to disease introduction and transmission, primarily from the marine environment or adjacent culture systems. The economic impact of disease to these production systems can be significant, as farmers must incur the cost of preventative measures, such as vaccines and antibiotics, and then, if the fish become infected, the cost of lost or reduced harvests. Although we will produce and grow our AquAdvantage Salmon in land-based, closed containment facilities, we will still be at risk for potential disease outbreaks. We have implemented biosecurity measures in our facilities intended to prevent or mitigate disease impact, but there can be no assurance that any measures will be 100% effective.\nOur ability to compete may be negatively impacted if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies or if we lose some of our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the United States and abroad for our technologies and resultant products and potential products. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and abroad with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products; however, the patent to the technology covering AquAdvantage Salmon, which we license under a global, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive license from Genesis and HSC, expired in August 2013. We expect to protect our proprietary technology in regards to AquAdvantage Salmon through a combination of in-house know-how and the deterrence of the regulatory process that would need to be completed for a competing product to be commercialized, which we believe would be cost-prohibitive to our competitors. There can be no guaranty that this strategy will be successful.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies, particularly in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. While we require our employees, academic collaborators, consultants, and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us, if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary and licensed technologies and other confidential information, our ability and that of our\nlicensor to receive patent protection, and our ability to protect valuable information owned or licensed by us may be imperiled.\nEnforcing our intellectual property rights may be difficult and unpredictable.\nEnforcing our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome of such efforts can be unpredictable. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our technologies, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable or assert that the patent does not cover its manufacturing processes, manufacturing components, or products. Furthermore, in patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging both invalidity and unenforceability are commonplace. Although we may believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with the duty of candor and in good faith, the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patent rights, we cannot be certain, for example, that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would not be able to exclude others from practicing the inventions claimed therein. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if our patent rights are found to be valid and enforceable, patent claims that survive litigation may not cover commercially valuable products or prevent competitors from importing or marketing products similar to our own, or using manufacturing processes or manufacturing components similar to those used to produce the products using our technologies.\nAlthough we believe we have obtained assignments of patent rights from all inventors, if an inventor did not adequately assign their patent rights to us, a third party could obtain a license to the patent from such inventor. This could preclude us from enforcing the patent against such third party.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, often do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to genetic engineering. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nCompetitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or garner greater market share than ours.\nWe do not believe that we have a direct competitor for genetically modified, growth-enhanced Atlantic salmon. However, the market for Atlantic salmon is dominated by a group of large, multinational corporations with entrenched distribution channels. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to demonstrate that AquAdvantage Salmon is superior to and/or less expensive than other products available in the market. Certain of our competitors may benefit from government support and other incentives that are not available to us. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing and/or superior products and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we can. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, a competitor could acquire patent or other rights that may limit our ability to successfully market our product.\nIf our technologies or products are stolen, misappropriated, or reverse engineered, others could use the technologies to produce competing technologies or products.\nThird parties, including our collaborators, contractors, and others involved in our business often have access to our technologies. If our technologies or products were stolen, misappropriated, or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties that may be able to reproduce our technologies or products using our technologies for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to challenge this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection.\nIf we lose key personnel, including key management personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, it could delay our commercialization plans or harm our research and development efforts, and we may be unable to sell or develop our own products.\nOur success depends substantially on the efforts and abilities or our officers and other key employees. The loss of any key members of our management, or the failure to attract or retain other key employees who possess the requisite expertise for the conduct of our business, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products and executing on our business strategy. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology-based businesses, or due to the unavailability of personnel with the particular qualifications or experience necessary for our business. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience staffing constraints that could adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs. In particular, our product development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists. Competition for experienced scientists and other technical personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to attract and retain such personnel on acceptable terms.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe could face a period of rapid growth following commercial availability of our products, which may place significant pressure on our management, sales, operational, and financial resources. The execution of our business plan and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage current and planned expansion and on our ability to continue to implement and improve our operational management. Any failure to manage the planned growth may have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, trading performance, and prospects.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may acquire businesses, assets, technologies, or products to enhance our business in the future. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities, which would dilute our current shareholders;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nassume significant liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the purchased operations, technologies, or products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and other liabilities;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective customers and/or suppliers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees.\nWe do not have extensive experience in managing the integration process, and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial, and management resources. The integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale, or cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the business. Acquisitions also may require us to record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into agreements that require us to pay a significant portion of our future revenue to third parties.\nIn 2009, we received a grant from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to fund a research program. A total of C$2.9 million was made available under the grant, and we received the entire amount through December 31, 2015. Once we begin to generate revenue, we must commence repayment of the outstanding loan in the form of a 10% royalty. These payments could negatively impact our ability to support our operations.\nIn February 2013, we entered into the ECC with Intrexon, pursuant to which we are permitted to use Intrexon\u2019s UltraVector and other technology platforms to develop and commercialize additional genetically modified traits in finfish for human consumption. The ECC grants us a worldwide license to use specified patents and other intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products involving DNA administered to finfish for human consumption. We agreed under the ECC to pay Intrexon, on a quarterly basis, 16.66% of the gross profits calculated for each developed product. We also agreed to pay Intrexon 50% of the quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. In addition, we agreed to reimburse Intrexon for the costs of certain services provided by Intrexon. The ECC remains in effect. These payments could negatively impact our ability to support our operations.\nOur financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including exchange rate fluctuation.\nThe majority of our employees, including our research personnel, are located outside of the United States. As a consequence of the international nature of our business, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are based in the United States and present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and the majority of our cash resources are held in U.S. dollars or in Canadian dollars. Some of our future expenses and revenues are expected to be denominated in currencies other than in U.S. dollars. Therefore, movements in exchange rates to\ntranslate to foreign currencies may have a negative impact on our reported results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe have received government research grants and loans in the past, but such grants and loans may not be available in the future.\nWe have in the past received government assistance in the form of research grants and loans to partially fund various research projects, including projects involving our AquAdvantage Salmon. There can be no assurance that additional government assistance will be available in the future to help offset the cost of our research activities, in which case we would need to fund our research projects entirely from our available cash resources, which may be limited. This could delay progress on future product development and introduction. In addition, we may be subject to audit by the government agencies that provided research assistance to ensure that the funds were used in accordance with the terms of the grant or loan. Any audit of the use of these funds would require the expenditure of funds and result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nOur success will depend in part on our ongoing relationship with Intrexon.\nWe are party to agreements with Intrexon, including the ECC. Our success will depend, in part, on the maintenance of our ongoing relationship with Intrexon.\nCertain members of management and our Board of Directors may hold stock in both Intrexon and AquaBounty, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nThe management and directors of each of Intrexon and AquaBounty may own both Intrexon common stock and AquaBounty common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when AquaBounty management and directors and Intrexon management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for AquaBounty and Intrexon. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between AquaBounty and Intrexon regarding the terms of their relationship. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of additional commercial arrangements that AquaBounty or Intrexon may enter into in the future.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nIntrexon\u2019s significant share ownership position allows it to influence corporate matters.\nIntrexon currently holds approximately 58.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Third Security, LLC and its affiliates other than Intrexon (\u201cThird Security\u201d) hold approximately 9.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Randal J. Kirk, Intrexon\u2019s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and controlling shareholder, and Third Security\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Senior Managing Director, has reported beneficial ownership of approximately 68.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which includes shares owned by both Intrexon and Third Security. In addition, we have granted to Intrexon certain rights to nominate members of our Board of Directors that are intended to ensure that Intrexon-nominated Board members represent a percentage of our Board that is proportionate to Intrexon\u2019s percentage ownership of our common stock. Accordingly, Intrexon will be able to significantly influence who serves on our Board of Directors and the outcome of matters required to be submitted to our shareholders for approval, including decisions relating to the outcome of any proposed merger or consolidation of our company. Intrexon\u2019s interests may not be consistent with those of our other shareholders. In addition, Intrexon\u2019s significant interest in us may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire control of us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is currently traded on AIM and the NASDAQ Capital Market, an active trading market for our common stock may never develop or, if developed, be maintained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop or is not maintained, it may be difficult for shareholders to sell shares of our common stock. An inactive trading market may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nThe price of our shares of common stock is likely to be volatile.\nThe share price of publicly traded emerging companies can be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The prices at which our common stock are quoted and the prices which investors may realize will be influenced by a large number of factors, some specific to our company and operations and some which may affect the quoted biotechnology sector, or quoted companies generally. These factors could include variations in our operating results, publicity regarding the process of obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize our products, divergence in financial results from analysts\u2019 expectations, changes in earnings estimates by stock market analysts, overall market or sector sentiment, legislative changes in our sector, the performance of our research and development programs, large purchases or sales of our common stock, currency fluctuations, legislative changes in the genetic engineering environment, and general economic conditions. Certain of these events and factors are outside of our control. Stock markets have from time to time experienced severe price and volume fluctuations, which, if recurring, could adversely affect the market prices for our commons stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the operations, development, and growth of our business. There can be no assurance that AquaBounty will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends at any time in the future. As a result, absent payment of dividends, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to shareholders. You may also have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment in us.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe U.S. trading market for our shares of common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our shares of common stock may be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our shares of common stock, changes their opinion of our shares, or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares of common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price and trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, compliance with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors\u2019 report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the requirements of holding advisory \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation not previously approved. Under the JOBS Act, we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, (2) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock to be less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares of common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies also can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nOur shareholders may not have the same protections generally available to shareholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies because we are currently a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules.\nBecause Intrexon holds a majority of the voting power for the election of our Board of Directors, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(c). As a controlled company, we qualify for exemptions from several of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, including requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\ncompensation of officers be determined or recommended to our Board of Directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\ndirector nominees be selected or recommended to our Board of Directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWhile our Board of Directors has determined that a majority of its members are independent, we are not required to have a compensation committee or a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, our shareholders may not be afforded the same protections generally as shareholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies for so long as Intrexon controls the\ncomposition of our Board of Directors and our Board of Directors determines to rely upon exemptions available to controlled companies.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nWhile we have no specific plan to issue preferred stock, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more series of preferred stock having such designation, relative powers, preferences, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, voting rights, terms of conversion or redemption, and other relative, participating, optional, or other special rights, if any, of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as our Board of Directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThe financial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time consuming and may place significant additional demands on our management.\nThe obligations of being a public company in the United States require significant expenditures, which we estimate will be approximately $400 thousand annually, and place additional demands on our management, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements for the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, despite reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, the reporting requirements, rules, and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly if we were no longer to qualify as an emerging growth company. Any changes that we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.\nThese rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These factors also could make\nit more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, or as executive officers.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nEven though our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with standards necessary to maintain a listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our failure to meet the continuing listing requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some of our shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions of our articles of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding that the number of members of our board is limited to a range fixed by our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to issue securities with voting rights and thwart a takeover attempt.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Section 203 prevents some shareholders holding more than 15% of our voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder was approved in advance by our Board of Directors, results in the shareholder holding more than 85% of our voting stock, subject to certain restrictions, or is approved at an annual or special meeting of shareholders by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock not held by the shareholder engaging in the transaction.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16541, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AQB"}
