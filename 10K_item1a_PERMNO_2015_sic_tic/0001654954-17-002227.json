{"cik": "1414374", "company": "Paragon Commercial CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are potential risks that management considers material and that could affect the future operating results and financial condition of the Company and the Bank. These do not necessarily include all the risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that management does not currently deem material could also have a material adverse impact on our business, results of our operations and financial condition.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. A customer\u2019s failure to repay us is usually preceded by missed monthly payments. In some instances, however, a customer may declare bankruptcy prior to missing payments, and, following a borrower filing bankruptcy, a lender\u2019s recovery of the credit extended is often limited. Since many of our loans are secured by collateral, we may attempt to seize the collateral if and when a customer defaults on a loan. However, the value of the collateral may not equal the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customer. The resolution of nonperforming assets, including the initiation of foreclosure proceedings, requires significant commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, and exposes us to additional legal costs. Elevated levels of loan delinquencies and bankruptcies in our market area generally and among our customers specifically, can be precursors of future charge-offs and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, or ALL. Higher charge-off rates, delays in the foreclosure process or in obtaining judgments against defaulting borrowers or an increase in our ALL may hurt our overall financial performance if we are unable to increase revenue to compensate for these losses, may increase our cost of funds, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent upon the quality of our assets, particularly loans. In originating loans, there is a substantial likelihood that we will experience credit losses. The risk of loss will vary with, among other things, general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and real estate market, the type of loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses that may occur. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information.\nIf our assumptions are wrong, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses, and we may need to make adjustments to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to our allowance in the form of provisions for loan losses would materially decrease our net income. We expect our allowance to continue to fluctuate; however, given current and future market conditions, our allowance may not be adequate to cover future loan losses.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulators could have a negative effect on our operating results and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain a number of large borrowing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if they were not to perform according to their terms.\nWe maintain a number of large borrowing relationships. Our ten largest borrowing relationships (which could include multiple loans) at December 31, 2016 range from $8.8 million to $17.5 million and averaged $11.0 million. The deterioration of one or more of these relationships could result in a significant increase in our non-performing loans and our provision for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations and the value of our common stock. Our ten largest borrowing relationships represent approximately 8.2% of our total credit exposure.\nWe maintain a number of large deposit relationships, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe maintain a number of large deposit relationships. Our ten largest deposit relationships at December 31, 2016 range from $50.5 million to $13.3 million, averaged $24.8 million and made up 21.1% of our total deposits. The ability to attract these types of deposit relationships has a positive impact on our net interest margin since they provide a relatively low cost of funds compared to certificates of deposit or borrowing advances. If these depositors were to withdraw these funds and we were not able to replace them with similar types of deposits, the cost of funds would increase and our results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk in our operations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances, to pay obligations as they come due, to capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or to pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to stockholders, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Our liquidity is derived primarily from customer deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations, and access to other funding sources. Our largest customer deposit relationships comprise a large portion of our deposit base and the loss of any one of these relationships could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s liquidity position. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or at a reasonable cost could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could adversely affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn, our lack of access to a traditional branch banking network designed to generate core deposits, the loss of one or more of our larger deposit relationships and adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Our access to borrowed funds could become limited in the future, and we may be required to pay above market rates for additional borrowed funds, if we are able to obtain them at all, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChallenging market conditions and economic trends historically had an adverse effect on the banking industry and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a business operating in the challenging and uncertain financial services environment. The success of our business and operations is sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and locally in our industry and market. If the U.S. economy weakens and a lack of growth in population, income levels, deposits and business investment in our local markets occurs, our growth and profitability from our lending and deposit services could be adversely affected. Although economic conditions have improved in recent years, financial institutions continue to be affected by volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country and also by uncertain regulatory and interest rate conditions. We retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate market in North Carolina, particularly in the Raleigh and Charlotte metropolitan areas, and are affected by these events.\nUncertain market and economic conditions can make our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and estimate the losses in our loan portfolio more complex. Another national economic recession or continued deterioration of conditions in our market could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u25cf\nloan delinquencies may rise;\n\u25cf\nnonperforming assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u25cf\ndemand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u25cf\ncollateral securing our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability.\nOur loan portfolio mix, which includes income producing commercial real estate loans, could result in increased credit risk in a challenging economy.\nApproximately 53.9% of our loan portfolio consists of income producing commercial real estate and owner-occupied commercial business loans. These types of loans generally are viewed as carrying more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments. In fact, the FDIC has issued pronouncements alerting banks of its concern about heavy loan concentrations in certain types of commercial real estate loans, including acquisition, construction and development loans, and heavy loan concentrations in certain geographic segments. Because a portion of our loan portfolio is composed of these types of higher-risk loans, we face an increased risk of nonperforming loans that could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny deterioration or downturn in the economies or real estate values in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and the value of the real property securing those loans. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans would then be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in the interest rate environment could reduce our net interest income, which could reduce our profitability.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect our ability to fund our operations with customer deposits, and the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates affects us more than non-financial companies and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and results of operations. Further, because we have little noninterest income, any change in general market interest rates may affect our net income and results of operation more significantly than other financial institutions with higher amounts of noninterest income. Market interest rates are sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies that are implemented through open market operations and regulation of the discount rate and reserve requirements.\nOur assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, potential borrowers could seek to defer loans as they wait for interest rates to settle, borrowers of variable rate loans may be subject to increased interest rates, which could result in a greater rate of default, and we may have to pay higher interest on deposits before interest earned on our assets increases. Rising interest rates may also present additional challenges to our business that we have not anticipated. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have material adverse effects on our net interest margin, noninterest income, and results of operations.\nWe depend primarily on net interest income for our earnings rather than noninterest income.\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our operating income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net interest income totaled $46.0 million in comparison to our total noninterest income of $1.3 million earned during the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net interest income totaled $41.1 million in comparison to our total noninterest income of $1.5 million earned during the same year. We do not rely on nontraditional sources of fee income utilized by some community banks, such as fees from sales of insurance, securities or investment advisory products or services. The amount of our net interest income is influenced by the overall interest rate environment, competition, and the amount of interest-earning assets relative to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities. In the event that one or more of these factors were to result in a decrease in our net interest income, we have limited sources of noninterest income to offset any decrease in our net interest income\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $197.4 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of our common stock. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our inability to accurately predict the future performance of an issuer or to efficiently respond to changing market conditions could result in a decline in the value of our investment securities portfolio, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. We expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our president and chief executive officer, and other senior officers. The unexpected loss of any of our key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur CDOs are responsible for extensive client relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations.\nOur CDOs have developed extensive and deep relationships with our clients. If one or more of our CDOs who manages a large portfolio of business were to leave our employ, we may also lose the client relationships managed by that CDO. The resulting loss of loan or deposit relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not successful in addressing management succession issues and attracting and retaining qualified personnel, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our management to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. We must successfully manage transition and replacement issues that may result from the departure or retirement of members of our executive management. Changes of management personnel in the future could cause disruption to our operations or customer relationships or a decline in our operating results.\nWe are also dependent on our ability to retain and motivate our existing highly qualified personnel, including Robert C. Hatley, our President and Chief Executive Officer. These personnel may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The replacement of Mr. Hatley likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of his services may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel in our market areas is frequently intense. We may not be successful in attracting qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring such personnel, particularly senior management, could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business reputation is important and any damage to it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur reputation is very important to sustain our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, and the industries and communities that we serve. We have set ourselves apart from our competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with our customers and being active members of the communities we serve. As such, we strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve and delivering superior service to our customers. Any damage to our reputation or negative public opinion, whether arising from legal, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, the conduct of our business or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure data processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems and the technology we use could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We may fail to promptly identify or adequately address any such failures, interruptions or security breaches if they do occur. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nThe nature of our business may make it an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. The technology-based platform we use processes sensitive data from our borrowers and investors. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we have access to, our security measures and the security measures employed by the owners of the technology in the platform that we use could be breached. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our systems could cause confidential customer, borrower and investor information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in the technology-based platform that we use are exposed and exploited, our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability.\nBecause techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our collaborators may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, federal regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause customers, borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers, borrowers, investors and partners and adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business relies heavily on information technology and telecommunications systems; the failure of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the value of our common stock.\nA failure in or breach of the operational or security systems of our third-party service providers could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. We face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur business concentration in North Carolina, specifically in the Raleigh and Charlotte metropolitan areas, imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting North Carolina.\nWe conduct our operations almost exclusively in the Raleigh and Charlotte metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2016, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in North Carolina, and specifically, in these metropolitan areas, and the substantial majority of our secured loans were secured by collateral located in these metropolitan areas. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in North Carolina, and specifically in the Raleigh and Charlotte metropolitan areas, are dependent on the life sciences, information technology, and financial services sectors, among others. Any downturn or adverse development in these sectors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and future prospects. Adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non-performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects North Carolina, our existing or prospective borrowers or property values in our market area may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than those of our competitors, who may have larger operations that are less geographically focused on our market area.\nThe amount of other real estate owned, or OREO, may increase significantly, resulting in additional losses, and costs and expenses that will negatively affect our operations.\nIn connection with our banking business, we take title to real estate collateral from time to time through foreclosure or otherwise in connection with efforts to collect debts previously contracted. Such real estate is referred to as other real estate owned, or OREO. As the amount of OREO increases, our losses, and the costs and expenses to maintain the real estate, likewise increase. The amount of OREO we hold may increase due to various economic conditions or other factors. Any additional increase in losses and maintenance costs and expenses due to OREO may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Such effects may be particularly pronounced in a market of reduced real estate values and excess inventory, which may make the disposition of OREO properties more difficult, increase maintenance costs and expenses, and reduce our ultimate realization from any OREO sales. In addition, at the time of acquisition of the OREO we are required to reflect its fair market value in our financial statements. If the OREO declines in value subsequent to its acquisition but prior to its disposition, we are required to recognize a loss. As a result, declines in the value of our OREO will have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur utilization of time deposits, including out-of-market and brokered certificates of deposit, as a source of funds for loans and our other liquidity needs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs, including time deposits and brokered certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2016, brokered deposits, excluding certain Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service deposits, or CDARS, comprised approximately 6.5% of our total deposits. Such deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, depositors may not renew those time deposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or keep them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not being able to attract those deposits or to keep or replace them as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, we are regulated by the FDIC, which requires us to maintain certain capital levels to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d If we fail to maintain these capital levels, we could lose our ability to obtain funding through brokered deposits. In addition, we may also be restricted from paying higher deposit rates to attract, keep or replace those deposits, which could have a negative effect on our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain and manage our growth, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategy has been to increase the size of our company by pursuing business development opportunities. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with our growth strategy. Our inability to increase our volume of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. Furthermore, we may be required to curtail our future growth in order to comply with regulatory restrictions imposed by banking regulators. Our inability to sustain our historical rate of growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and on the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan secured by real property or how to value the loan in the future may not accurately describe the net value of the collateral that we can realize.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values may experience changes in value in relatively short periods of time, especially given heightened economic uncertainty, this estimate might not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan has been closed. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our OREO and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of OREO, and our ALL may not reflect accurate loan impairments. The valuation of the properties securing the loans in our portfolio may negatively impact the continuing value of those loans and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action or reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, our employees and vendors.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information may not be detected prior to funding a loan or during our ongoing monitoring of outstanding loans. In addition, one or more of our employees or vendors could cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our loan documentation, operations or systems. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face strong competition from larger, more established competitors.\nThe banking business in North Carolina in general, and in our market areas of Raleigh, Charlotte and Cary in particular, is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do and have been in existence a longer period of time. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and originating loans. We may not be able to attract customers away from our competition. We compete for loans and deposits with the following types of institutions:\n\u25cf other commercial banks\n\u25cf savings banks\n\u25cf thrifts\n\u25cf trust companies\n\u25cf credit unions\n\u25cf securities brokerage firms\n\u25cf mortgage brokers\n\u25cf insurance companies\n\u25cf mutual funds\n\u25cf industrial loan companies\nCompetitors that are not depository institutions are generally not regulated as extensively as we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Other competitors are subject to similar regulation but have the advantages of larger established customer bases, higher lending limits, extensive branch networks, greater advertising-marketing budgets or other factors.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans, primarily on the basis of the interest rates we pay and yield on these products. Many of our competitors are well-established, much larger financial institutions that already serve many of our targeted customers. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions, we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation, legislative, regulatory and technological changes, and the emergence of alternative banking sources.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u25cf\nour ability to build and maintain long-term customer relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices;\n\u25cf\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services that we offer;\n\u25cf\ncustomer satisfaction with our products and services;\n\u25cf\nindustry and general economic trends; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology.\nIncreased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our primary markets could cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are limited in the amount we can lend to one borrower.\nOur legal lending limit is determined by law and is 15% of our permitted capital accounts with an additional 10% available for certain loans meeting heightened collateral requirements. This means that the size of loans which we can offer our customers is smaller than the size of loans that our larger competitors are able to offer. Furthermore, we generally impose an internal limit that is more conservative than the legal maximum. This limit may affect, to some degree, our success in establishing relationships with the larger businesses in our market. We satisfy loan requests in excess of our lending limit through the sale of participations in such loans to other banks. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or maintain customers seeking larger loans or that we will be able to sell participations in such loans on terms we consider favorable. Our inability to attract and maintain these customers or our inability to sell loan participations on favorable terms could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, and the value of our common stock.\nOur loan portfolio may be affected by deterioration in real estate markets, including declines in the performance of loans.\nDeterioration in real estate markets could result in declining prices and excess inventories. As a result, developers may experience financial deterioration and banking institutions may experience declines in the performance of construction, development and commercial loans. We make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of borrowers or projects combined with our expectations for the future. If conditions are worse than forecast, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies than is provided in the allowance for loan losses, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDeterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our subsidiary\u2019s banking operations.\nThe long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. government and federal agencies. In addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. government and federal agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, it could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDeterioration in the commercial soundness of our counterparties could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could create another market-wide liquidity crisis similar to that experienced in late 2008 and early 2009 and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. The deterioration or failure of our counterparties would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have different lending risks than larger, more diversified banks.\nOur ability to diversify our economic risks is limited and we may, therefore, be exposed to greater lending risks than those of banks lending to larger, better-capitalized businesses with longer operating histories. Our middle market and small business customers generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and may have limited operating histories.\nWe attempt to manage our credit exposure through careful monitoring of loan applicants and through loan approval and review procedures. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses is an estimate based on experience, judgment and expectations regarding our borrowers, and the economies in which we and our borrowers operate, as well as the judgment of our regulators. This is an inherently uncertain process, and our loan loss reserves may not be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to respond to future technological changes and the ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nThese changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.\nWe are dependent upon the use of intellectual property owned by third parties, and any change in our ability to use, or the terms upon which we may use, this intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on technology licensed from third-party vendors. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain such licenses on terms that are acceptable or at all. Termination of licenses or the reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new licenses with less favorable terms, or the inability to obtain access to such licensed technology at all. If we were to lose access to technology we require to operate our business, or were only able to access the technology on less favorable terms, we would not be able to offer our customers the services they seek from us and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nWe have implemented a risk management framework to manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial and other modeling methodologies which involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and it may fail to adequately mitigate risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our securities from NASDAQ. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could subject us to litigation.\nChanges in accounting standards and management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, including assumptions and estimates, could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In addition, management is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates are incorrect, we may experience unexpected material adverse consequences that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, and this control may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our directors and executive officers and their related entities currently beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 24.6% of our outstanding common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. In addition, these stockholders will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change in control would benefit our other stockholders.\nFulfilling our public company financial reporting and other regulatory obligations is expensive and time-consuming and may strain our resources.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to implement specific corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements under the rules and regulations of the SEC as well as the rules of Nasdaq. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Compliance with these requirements is time-consuming and expensive and may strain our resources.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, or changes in any of them.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including the declaration and payment of cash dividends to stockholders, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits, and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth and operations. Should we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, federal and state regulators could impose additional restrictions on the activities of the Company and the Bank, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have recently changed and may continue to change, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted on July 21, 2010. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and its implementing regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some or all of the changes, including the broad rulemaking authority granted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, may result in greater liability, reporting requirements, assessment fees, operational restrictions, capital requirements, and other regulatory burdens applicable to us, and many of our non-bank competitors may remain free from such limitations. Institutions with over $10 billion in assets, unlike us, will also be subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervisory and examination authority. The changes arising out of the Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain depositors, to offer competitive products and services, and to expand our business.\nCongress may consider additional proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies. Such legislation may change existing banking statutes and regulations, as well as our current operating environment significantly. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand our permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, or business and earnings, as well as the value of the common stock.\nWe may be required to raise additional capital in the future, including to comply with new increased minimum capital thresholds established by our regulators as part of their implementation of Basel III, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and could be dilutive to our existing stockholders, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved final rules that establish an integrated regulatory capital framework that addresses perceived shortcomings in certain capital requirements. The rules implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe major provisions of the rule applicable to the Company and the Bank are:\n\u25cf\nThe rules implement higher minimum capital requirements, including a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet in order to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. These enhancements both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, better equipping the U.S. banking system to deal with adverse economic conditions. The new minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, which is an increase from 4.0 %, and a total capital ratio that remains at 8.0 %. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets) is 4.0%. The new rules maintain the general structure of the current prompt corrective action, or PCA, framework while incorporating increased minimum requirements.\n\u25cf\nAmong the most important changes to the definition of capital are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that disallow the inclusion of instruments such as trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital going forward, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, deferred tax assets, or DTAs, mortgage-servicing assets, or MSAs and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The new rules also affect the inclusion of mortgage servicing assets, or MSAs, as an element of capital. Specifically, MSAs are limited to 10% of a bank\u2019s common equity Tier 1 capital and the combined balance of MSAs, deferred tax assets, and investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions is limited to 15% of a bank\u2019s common equity Tier 1 capital. These combined assets must be deducted from common equity to the extent that they exceed the 15% threshold. Any portion of a bank\u2019s MSAs that are not deducted from the calculation of common equity Tier 1 will be subject to a 100% risk weight that will increase to 250% in 2018. In addition, the new rules require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital.\n\u25cf\nUnder the rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer will help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements, and corresponding limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, began on January 1, 2016. After the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, a banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, it would prohibit a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the PCA well-capitalized thresholds.\n\u25cf\nThe rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and make selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.\nWe and the Bank were required to comply with the new capital rules beginning on January 1, 2015.\nIn order to support the operations at the Bank, we may need to raise capital in the future. Our ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control.\nAccordingly, we may be unable to raise capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us if at all. If we cannot raise capital when needed, our ability to operate or further expand our operations could be materially impaired. In addition, if we decide to raise equity capital under such conditions, the interests of our stockholders could be diluted.\nOur deposit operations are subject to extensive regulation and we expect additional regulatory requirements to be implemented in the future.\nWe are subject to significant anti-money laundering, \u201cknow your customer\u201d and other regulations under applicable law, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act, and we could become subject in the future to additional regulatory requirements beyond those that are currently adopted, proposed or contemplated. We expect that federal and state bank regulators will increase their oversight, inspection and investigatory role over our deposit operations and the financial services industry generally. Furthermore, we intend to increase our deposit product offerings and grow our customer deposit portfolio in the future and, as a result, we are, and will continue to be, subject to heightened compliance and operating costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may have an adverse effect on our business practices and results of operations.\nThe FDIC Deposit Insurance assessments that we are required to pay may increase in the future, which would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nAs a member institution of the FDIC, we are assessed a quarterly deposit insurance premium. Failed banks nationwide, particularly between 2008 and 2010, have significantly depleted the insurance fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. On October 19, 2010, the FDIC adopted a Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, Restoration Plan, which requires the DIF to attain a 1.35% reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to \u201coffset the effect\u201d of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. In addition, the FDIC modified the method by which assessments are determined and updated assessment rates, which range from 2.5 to 45 basis points (annualized), subject to adjustments for unsecured debt and, in the case of small institutions outside the lowest risk category and certain large and highly complex institutions, brokered deposits. Further increased FDIC assessment premiums, due to our risk classification, emergency assessments, or implementation of the modified DIF reserve ratio, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nA bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when our resources are limited and we may be required to borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe low trading volume in our common stock may adversely affect your ability to resell shares at prices that you find attractive or at all.\nOur common stock is listed for quotation on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol \u201cPBNC\u201d. The average daily trading volume for our common stock is less than that of larger financial institutions. From June 16, 2016, to March 20, 2017, the average daily trading volume for our common stock was approximately 8,350 shares. Due to its relatively low trading volume, sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, it may be difficult for holders to resell their shares at prices they find attractive, or at all.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe had 5,450,713 shares of common stock outstanding at March 20, 2017, none of which remain subject to post-initial public offering lock-up agreements. In addition, as of March 20, 2017, there were outstanding options to purchase 44,875 shares of our common stock that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale. A large portion of these shares and options are held by a small number of persons. Sales by these stockholders or option holders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we could lose that status sooner if our gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, or if we choose to rely on additional exemptions in the future. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage on our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analyst cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not plan to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, as we intend to retain any earnings to provide the capital necessary to fund our growth strategy. You should not invest in shares of our common stock if you need dividend income from your investment. Our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will be dependent upon, among other things, restrictions imposed by the reserve and capital requirements of North Carolina and federal banking regulations, our income and financial condition, tax considerations, Paragon Bank\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends and general business conditions. Investors should not purchase shares of our common stock with a view for a current return on their investment in the form of cash dividends.\nAdditional issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may dilute holders of our common stock.\nWe may, in the future, determine that it is advisable, or we may encounter circumstances where we determine it is necessary, to issue additional shares of common stock, securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent an interest in common stock, or common stock-equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital. Our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock from time to time for adequate consideration without any additional action on the part of our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of other offerings, as well as other sales of a large block of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize us to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series, the designation of such series, and the dividend rate for each series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock may be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, and ownership of the common stock may have regulatory implications for holders thereof.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws, including the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or BHCA, and federal and state banking regulations, that will impact the rights and obligations of owners of our common stock, including, for example, our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. Shares of our common stock are voting securities for purposes of the BHCA and any bank holding company or foreign bank that is subject to the BHCA may need approval to acquire or retain more than 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, and any holder (or group of holders deemed to be acting in concert) may need regulatory approval to acquire or retain 10% or more of the shares of our common stock. A holder or group of holders may also be deemed to control us if they own 25% or more of our total equity. Under certain limited circumstances, a holder or group of holders acting in concert may exceed the 25% percent threshold and not be deemed to control us until they own 33% percent or more of our total equity. The amount of total equity owned by a holder or group of holders acting in concert is calculated by aggregating all shares held by the holder or group, whether as a combination of voting or non-voting shares or through other positions treated as equity for regulatory or accounting purposes and meeting certain other conditions. Holders of our common stock should consult their own counsel with regard to regulatory implications.\nHolders should not expect us to redeem or repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is a perpetual equity security. This means that it has no maturity or mandatory redemption date and will not be redeemable at the option of the holders. Any decision we may make at any time to propose the repurchase or redemption of shares of our common stock will depend upon, among other things, our evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our stockholders\u2019 equity, general market conditions at that time and other factors we deem relevant. Our ability to redeem shares of our common stock is subject to regulatory restrictions and limitations, including those of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\nOur common stock is equity and is therefore subordinate to our outstanding indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests in the Company and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our common stock rank junior to our outstanding trust preferred securities and subordinated notes\nOfferings of debt, which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, senior or subordinated notes, preferred stock and common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could adversely affect our stockholders.\nIn some cases, stockholders would receive a premium for their shares if we were acquired by another company. However, state and federal law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for anyone to acquire us without approval of our board of directors. For example, our articles of incorporation require a supermajority vote of two-thirds of our outstanding common stock in order to effect a sale or merger of the company in certain circumstances. Consequently, a takeover attempt may prove difficult, and stockholders may not realize the highest possible price for their securities.\nShares of our common stock are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nShares of our common stock are not savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any depository institution and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. As a result, if you acquire shares of our common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 16106, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PBNC."}
