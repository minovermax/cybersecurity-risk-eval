{"cik": "826154", "company": "ORRSTOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Credit\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings would decrease.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses. The required level of reserves, and the related provision for loan losses can fluctuate from year to year, based on charge-offs and/or recoveries, loan volume, credit administration practices, and local and national economic conditions, among other factors. The ALL, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio\nof loans. The level of the ALL reflects management\u2019s evaluation of, among other factors, the status of specific impaired loans, historical loss experience, delinquency, credit concentrations and economic conditions within our market area. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our ALL.\nIf loan charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, there would be a need to record additional provisions to increase our ALL. Furthermore, growth in the loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses. The deterioration of one or more of our significant lending relationships could result in a substantial increase in nonperforming loans and the provision for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Generally, increases in our ALL will result in a decrease in net income and stockholders\u2019 equity, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we have elected to delay implementation of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, under the three-year delay permitted by the FASB in 2019. For a more complete description of the potential impact ASU 2016-13 may have on our financial statements and ALL, please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCommercial real estate lending may expose us to a greater risk of loss and impact our earnings and profitability.\nOur business strategy includes making loans secured by commercial real estate. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than other loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and may involve a greater degree of risk than other loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties are often dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. In challenging economic conditions, these loans represent higher risk and could result in an increase in our total net charge-offs, requiring us to increase our ALL, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nOur loan portfolio has a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans.\nOur loan portfolio is made up largely of commercial real estate loans. The federal banking agencies have promulgated guidance governing banks with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital or (ii) total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and that bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior thirty-six months. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are excluded from this second category. If the Bank is deemed to have a concentration in commercial real estate loans, we will be required to employ heightened risk management practices that address board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. At December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s construction, land development and other land concentration was 38%, commercial real estate loan concentration was 270% and the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by 99% during the prior thirty-six months. The Bank believes it has taken the appropriate steps to comply with the risk management practices, which are subject to regulatory examination. If our regulators conclude that we have not implemented appropriate risk management practices, it could adversely affect our business, and could result in the requirement to maintain increased capital levels or restrict our ability to originate new loans secured by commercial real estate. We can provide no assurance that capital would be available, or available on terms favorable to the Company, at that time.\nThe credit risk related to commercial and industrial loans is greater than the risk related to residential loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of risk of nonpayment or late payment than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans include advances to local and regional businesses for general commercial purposes and include permanent and short-term working capital, machinery and equipment financing, and may be either in the form of lines of credit or term loans. Although commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured to our highest rated borrowers, the majority of these loans are secured by the borrower\u2019s accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. In a significant number of these loans, the collateral also includes the business real estate or the business owner\u2019s personal real estate or assets. Commercial and industrial loans are more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy, as borrowers may have greater difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and the value of the collateral may decline. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our underwriting\nstandards, including evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower, regular monitoring, and, to the extent available, credit ratings on the business. However, these procedures cannot entirely eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial and industrial lending.\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our clients or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals applied for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. We participated as a lender in the PPP, which commenced on April 3, 2020. Lenders participating in the PPP have faced scrutiny about their loan application process and procedures, and the nature and type of the borrowers receiving PPP loans. We depend on our reputation as a trusted and responsible financial services company to compete effectively in the communities that we serve. Any negative public or client response to, or any litigation or claims that might arise out of, our participation in the PPP and any other legislative or regulatory initiatives and programs that were enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely impact our business. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation regarding our process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP and in connection with our processing of PPP loan forgiveness applications. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us. The Company had $195.3 million in gross outstanding balance of SBA PPP loans at December 31, 2021.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Investments\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Operating income, net income and liquidity depend to a great extent on our net interest margin. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. The nature and timing of any changes in interest rates or general economic conditions and their effect on us cannot be controlled and are difficult to predict. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings and liquidity, could be materially adversely affected. Our earnings and liquidity could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on interest-earning assets fall more quickly than those on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans, our ability to obtain and retain deposits, and the value of interest-earning assets, and the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets, which could all negatively impact shareholder's equity. The FRB recently has signaled its intention to raise interest rates in 2022. An increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations, which could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but could also necessitate further increases to our ALL. A decrease in interest rates may trigger loan prepayments, which may serve to reduce net interest income if we are unable to lend these funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates. In addition, based on our interest rate sensitivity analyses, an increase in the general level of interest rates will negatively affect the market value of the investment portfolio because of the relatively higher duration of certain securities included in the investment portfolio.\nOur subordinated notes, issued in December 2018, have a 6.0% fixed interest rate through December 2023, after which the interest rate will convert to a variable rate, equivalent to three-month LIBOR, or any replacement reference rate, plus 3.16% through maturity in December 2028. Depending on our financial condition at the time of the rate changing from fixed to variable, an increase in the interest rate on our subordinated debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur securities portfolio performance in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nUnrealized losses on investment securities result from changes in credit spreads and liquidity issues in the marketplace, along with changes in the credit profile of individual securities issuers. Under GAAP, we are required to review our investment portfolio periodically for the presence of impairment of our securities, taking into consideration current and future market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts' evaluations, our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be impaired, with the credit-related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to our earnings through a valuation allowance. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. Any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, deterioration or defaults made by issuers of the underlying collateral of our investment securities may cause additional credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charges to our income statement. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\nPotential downgrades of U.S. government securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings and financial condition.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Among other things, a downgrade in the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating could adversely impact the value of our securities portfolio and may trigger requirements that the Company post additional collateral for trades relative to these securities. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe expected discontinuance of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, issued or held by us that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for many of our transactions and contracts, which means it is the base on which relevant interest rates are determined. Transactions include those in which we lend and borrow money and issue, purchase and sell securities and engage in derivative transactions. Stemming from recent regulatory guidance and proposals to reform, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the process for setting LIBOR, announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR. This announcement created market uncertainty as to whether and to what extent panel banks would continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and as to the continued existence of LIBOR after 2021. The uncertainty lessened in November 2020, when the administrator of LIBOR, and the FCA, announced a proposal to extend the publication of the most commonly utilized tenors of USD LIBOR until June 30, 2023.\nWhile certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to be published until June 30, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021. These reforms may cause such rates to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. It is also possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to 2023 if a sufficient number of banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition from LIBOR would be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time frame for preparing for the transition.\nWith the phase out of LIBOR, there are alternative reference rates in circulation as a replacement. It is expected to be replaced primarily by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, which is a median of rates that market participants pay to borrow cash on an overnight basis, using U.S. Treasury Securities as collateral. Should SOFR ultimately replace LIBOR, risks will remain for us with respect to outstanding loans or other instruments using LIBOR. Those risks arise in connection\nwith transitioning those instruments to a new reference rate and the corresponding value transfer that may occur in connection with that transition. Risks related to transitioning instruments to SOFR, how LIBOR is calculated and LIBOR's availability include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by us and amounts paid on securities we have issued, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The value of loans, securities, derivatives or borrowings tied to LIBOR and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities could also be negatively impacted upon its discontinuance or phase out.\nThe Company has formed a cross-functional working group to lead the transition from LIBOR to a planned adoption of an alternate index. As of December 31, 2021, the Company ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans. The Company has elected to replace LIBOR with the 30-Day Average SOFR or Term SOFR in its loan agreements. Certain systems and products have been effectively transitioned away from LIBOR and are utilizing alternative reference rates. Remaining LIBOR transition project activities include remediation of remaining LIBOR products by June 2023. The Company is in the process of implementing fallback language for loans that will mature after 2021. The manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan, investment securities and derivative portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nRisks Related to Competition and to Our Business Strategy\nIf we cannot replace interest income on PPP loans, our net income would be adversely affected.\nInterest income recognized on PPP loans totaled $16.8 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As the balance of our PPP loan portfolio continues to decline, we expect interest income recognized on these loans to decline in 2022. If we are not able to replace interest income on PPP loans through non-PPP loan growth or otherwise, our net income could be adversely affected.\nDifficult economic and market conditions can adversely affect the financial services industry and may materially and adversely affect the Company.\nOur operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. If the growth of the U.S. economy slows, or if the economy worsens or enters into a recession, our growth and profitability could be constrained. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries can affect the stability of global financial markets, which could impact the U.S. economy and financial markets. Weak economic conditions, which could directly impact our operations, are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased loan delinquencies on real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity, and increased problem assets and foreclosures. All of these factors are detrimental to our business. In addition, our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause our business is concentrated in south central Pennsylvania, the greater Baltimore region, and Washington County, Maryland, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected by economic conditions and real estate values in these market areas.\nOur operations and the properties securing our loans are primarily located in south central Pennsylvania, the greater Baltimore region, and Washington County, Maryland. Our operating results depend largely on economic conditions and real estate valuations in these and surrounding areas. A deterioration in economic conditions, increased unemployment, inflation, and a decline in real estate values in these market areas or other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our operations.\nCompetition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nWe experience substantial competition in our market area. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income and liquidity by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we are able to charge on these loans.\nEmerging technologies have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry. In recent years, non-financial services firms, such as financial technology companies, have been offering services traditionally provided by financial institutions. These firms use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of\ncompanies and individuals to borrow money, save and invest. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; to develop competitive products and technologies; and to attract, retain and develop a highly skilled employee workforce. If we are not able to compete successfully, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in the loss of clients and market share, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nIn attracting deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including more expansive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or obtain new deposits. Increased deposit competition could materially adversely affect our ability to fund lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that could increase our cost of funds.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to adapt our products and services to technological advances, evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.\nThe banking industry undergoes constant technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal clients. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our current and prospective clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes the continuation of moderate growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOver the long term, we expect to continue to experience organic growth in loans and total assets, the level of our deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to successfully execute our business strategies, which includes continuing to grow our loan portfolio. Our ability to successfully grow will also depend on the continued availability of loan opportunities that meet underwriting standards. In addition, we may consider the acquisition of other financial institutions and branches within or outside of our market area to the extent permitted by our regulators. The success of any such acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate the acquired institutions or branches into the current operations of the Company; our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by clients of the acquired institution or branch locations; our ability to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from any acquisition; and our ability to retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of the acquired institution or branches. We believe we have the resources and internal systems in place to successfully achieve and manage our future growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan goals and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance, and legal reporting systems; internal controls; management review processes; and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.\nWe face security risks, including denial-of-service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and clients, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, in order to access our network, products, and services, our clients and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. We\nalso are subject to heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements that we have put in place for our employees in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe, our clients, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings to meet client demand and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years, in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber-attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence. Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e. \u201cspear phishing\u201d attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, or until well after a breach has occurred. The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.\nCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with clients and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of clients and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our clients; or damage to our or our clients\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.\nCybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.\nCybersecurity and data privacy issues have recently become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have in the past proposed, and may in the future propose, regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.\nWe receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our clients and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled.\nWe may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nWe invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could negatively impact the Company's growth, revenue and profit and could result in regulatory scrutiny. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components, which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nWe may become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nWe provide fiduciary services through OFA. From time to time, clients may make claims and take legal action with regard to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether such claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims or legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, the claims or related actions may result in significant financial expense and liability to us and/or adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace, as well as adversely impact client demand for our products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere is an increasing concern over the current and anticipated effects of climate change, which could negatively impact the Company and its clients. Weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts, can present risks to the Company and its clients, including property damage, change in the value of properties securing our loans, changes in client behavior and preferences, and disruption of business operations, all which can increase credit risk and result in loss of revenue and additional expenses. These concerns over the impacts of climate change have gained political and social attention resulting in many legislative and regulatory initiatives to lessen the effects of climate change, which also may result in heightened supervisory expectations on banks\u2019 risk management practices. Ongoing legislative and regulatory uncertainties and expanded requirements for climate risk management practices may result in increases to compliance and operating costs, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Mergers and Acquisitions\nGrowing by acquisition involves risks.\nWe intend to pursue a growth plan consistent with our business strategy, including growth by acquisition, as well as leveraging our existing branch network. To the extent that we acquire other companies in the future, our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent with such acquisitions. Some of these risks include the following:\n\u2022We may incur substantial expenses in pursuing potential acquisitions;\n\u2022management may divert its attention from other aspects of our business;\n\u2022we may assume potential and unknown liabilities of the acquired company;\n\u2022the acquired business may not perform in accordance with management's expectations, including potentially losing key clients of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties may arise in connection with the integration of the operations of the acquired business with our businesses; and\n\u2022we may lose key employees of the combined business.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions and competition. If we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel, control costs and maintain asset quality, this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nGoodwill generated in acquisitions may negatively affect our financial condition.\nTo the extent that merger consideration, consisting of cash and shares of our common stock, exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, that amount will be reported as goodwill by us. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by specific events or circumstances. A failure to realize the expected benefits of a merger could adversely impact the carrying value of the goodwill recognized in the merger and, in turn, negatively affect our financial results.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired entities over time.\nAcquisitions involve the integration with companies that previously operated independently. The potential difficulties of combining the operations of the acquired companies with Orrstown include integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds, integrating departments, systems operating procedures and information technologies, combining different corporate cultures, attracting new clients and retaining existing clients and key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration process could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.\nThe success of an acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses acquired with the Company. If we are unable to successfully execute on integration, the anticipated earnings and cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than anticipated.\nThe market price of our common stock after acquisitions may be affected by factors different from those affecting our shares currently.\nThe businesses of the Company and acquired entities may differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the shares of common stock of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of common stock of each separate entity. The market value of our common stock fluctuates based upon various factors, including changes in our business, operations or prospects, market assessments of the merger, regulatory considerations, market and economic considerations, and other factors. Further, the market price of our common stock after an acquisition may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our common stock. Additionally, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests, and may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nGovernmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may impair our operations or restrict our growth.\nThe Company is subject to regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the promotion of the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. Applicable laws and regulations impose capital adequacy requirements and restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from our subsidiaries. Our ability to service our obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries, primarily the Bank. The FRB requires a BHC to act as a source of\nfinancial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The FRB could require us to commit resources to the Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of our shareholders or creditors.\nWe are subject to supervision and examination by numerous governmental bodies. The results of these supervisory or examination activities could limit our ability to engage in new activities or expand. These activities also could result in significant fines, penalties, or required corrective actions, some of which could be difficult to implement. As we expand our product and service offerings, there could be an increase in state regulation affecting our operations. Different approaches to regulation by different jurisdictions could increase our compliance costs or risks of non-compliance.\nFinancial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced. The Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation, regulation or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities. Bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not subject to the same regulation. A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements and expectations could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory or enforcement actions or consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise permissible for us or additional requirements for engaging in new activities, and could also injure our reputation with clients and others with whom we do business.\nAltering our overdraft fee practices could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s fee income and results of operations.\nOverdraft fee practices of banks have recently come under increased regulatory scrutiny. This scrutiny, along with threats of litigation, have prompted many larger banks to reform their overdraft fee practices or cease charging overdraft fees altogether. Reforming, reducing or eliminating overdraft fees could materially adversely affect our fee income and results of operations.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that are required to be paid for FDIC insurance. If there are bank or financial institution failures, the Company may be required to pay significantly higher premiums than the levels currently imposed or additional special assessments or taxes that could adversely affect earnings. Any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income and other taxes could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal and U.S. state income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes, including the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's provisions for income taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes, and therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Increases in the assessment rate for the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax, which is calculated on the outstanding equity of the Bank, may also materially adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is required to use judgment in applying accounting policies and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to the reports of financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the ALL, the fair value of certain financial instruments, particularly securities, and goodwill and purchase accounting. While we have identified those accounting policies that we consider critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the associated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB, SEC and other regulatory bodies change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules have targeted higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital, as domestic and international bank regulatory agencies have sought to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain generally higher levels of capital. The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Company and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, result in the need for additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements, including limitations on our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and the PATRIOT Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the PATRIOT Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the FRB, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to enforcement actions even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of federal and state regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance were in place at the time. Failure to comply with these and other\nregulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions on our business.\nPending litigation and legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nAs more fully described in Note 23, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company believes that the allegations of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's third amended complaint are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend itself against those claims. It is not possible at this time to estimate reasonably possible losses, or even a range of reasonably possible losses, in connection with the litigation. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any losses associated with this litigation or that any losses that are incurred will not be material.\nIndemnification costs associated with litigation and legal proceedings could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally required, to the extent permitted by Pennsylvania law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in lawsuits. We also have certain contractual indemnification obligations to third parties regarding litigation including, with respect to the SEPTA litigation, the underwriters of our March 2010 public offering of common stock. Generally, insurance coverage is not available for such indemnification costs we could incur to third parties. Current or future litigation could result in indemnification expenses that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.\nMarket conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.\nAlthough we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us. If the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. These alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements, using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. These alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions, which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our cost of funding.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase if we lose deposits and are forced to replace them with more expensive sources of funding, if clients shift their deposits into higher cost products or if we need to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nWholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our operations and future growth.\nThe Company must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. To manage liquidity, we draw upon a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of investments and loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. Our ability to manage liquidity will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. In addition, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and clients to do business with us.\nThe Parent Company is a holding company dependent on liquidity through payments, including dividends, from its bank subsidiary, which is subject to restrictions.\nThe Parent Company is a holding company, separate from the Bank, and must provide for its own liquidity. The Parent Company depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from the Bank to fund dividend payments and stock repurchases, if permitted, and to fund all payments on obligations. The Bank is subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prohibit or reduce the flow of funds from it to us. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay dividends on our common stock or engage in stock repurchases. Further, as a result of the capital conservation buffer requirement, our ability to engage in stock repurchases, pay dividends on our common stock or service our debt could be restricted if we do not maintain a capital conservation buffer. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, including its depositors. Restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to dividend funds to the Company are included in Note 17, Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we are required to maintain to support such growth.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nIf the Company wants, or is compelled, to raise additional capital in the future, that capital may not be available when it is needed or on terms favorable to current shareholders.\nFederal banking regulators require us to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by our management and board of directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support our business operations. At December 31, 2021, all four capital ratios applicable to us were above regulatory minimum levels to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current bank regulatory guidelines. To be \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d banks generally must maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%.\nChanges in our financial condition or results of operations, applicable accounting standards, laws and regulations and other factors could make it necessary or advisable for the Company to raise additional capital. Under such circumstances, the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance of our ability to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us or to raise additional capital at all. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, we would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors by diluting earnings per share of our common stock and potentially diluting book value per share, depending on the issuance price. The price at which we issue additional shares of stock could be less than the current market price of our common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through the issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price. In addition, a capital raise involving the issuance of debt securities could negatively impact our earnings and liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been subject to fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated variations in our operational results and cash flows, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, trading volume, large purchases or sales of our common stock, market conditions within the banking industry, the general state of the securities markets and the market for stocks of financial institutions, as well as general economic conditions. In addition, if the Company\u2019s common stock ceases to be included in the Russell 2000 index, which is reconstituted in June of each year, this could result in decreased liquidity in, and demand for, our common stock, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.\nA credit rating agency regularly evaluates the Parent Company and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of the Parent Company or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our employees, clients, business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, severely impact the national economy and the regional and local markets in which we operate, lower equity market valuations, create significant volatility and disruption in capital and debt markets, and increase unemployment levels. Although the economy recovered somewhat in 2021, supply chain challenges and workforce shortages have contributed to rising inflationary pressures. Our business operations may be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. We are subject to heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements that we have put in place for our employees. Government policies and directives relating to the pandemic response are subject to change. Increases in deposit balances due, among other things, to government stimulus and relief programs could adversely affect our financial performance if we are unable to successfully lend or invest those funds. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business is dependent on future developments, including the severity and duration of emerging COVID-19 variants, the availability, effectiveness and distribution of vaccines and other public health measures, and the impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, vendors, counterparties and service providers, all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe Company may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nCompetition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and hire sufficiently skilled people to fill open and newly created positions or to retain current or future employees. This competition for talented, skilled and diverse employees has been intensified by the increase in remote and flexible work arrangements, wage pressures and opportunities in the labor market, as well as the national trend of large numbers of employees resigning from their jobs throughout 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is referred to as the \u201cGreat Resignation.\u201d Although the Company has not experienced a significant level of resignations, these trends have resulted in labor shortages in many of the Company\u2019s markets, which has made attracting new employees and replacing existing employees more difficult. An inability to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills to fill open positions, or the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel, could have a material adverse impact on our business due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience or the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could delay or reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships could be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the clients and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal controls.\nWe rely on our employees to design, manage, and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into, record and manage processes, transactions and other relationships with clients, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business. In some cases, we rely on employees of third parties to perform these tasks. We also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities. When we change processes or procedures, introduce new products or services, or implement new technologies, we may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes.\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on employees, whether ours or those of third parties, we are subject to human vulnerabilities. These range from innocent human error to misconduct or malfeasance, potentially leading to operational breakdowns or other failures. Our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our business, including risks associated with the design, operation and monitoring of automated systems. Errors by our employees or others responsible for systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of those systems and controls could result in significant harm to us. This could include client remediation costs, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, or limitations on our business activities. We could also suffer damage to our reputation, impacting our ability to attract and retain clients and employees.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nReputational risk, or the risk to the Company's earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities, including banking operations and trust and investment operations, our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues, and our protection of confidential client information. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to keep and attract clients and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients, communities and vendors, these steps may not be effective.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar events could disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and otherwise have a negative impact on our business and operations. While we have in place business continuity plans, such events could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications and technology), result in harm to, or cause travel limitations on, our employees, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties. These events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the U.S. or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. In addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of Pennsylvania law and provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us, even if a merger might be in the best interest of our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.", "PERMNO": 92919, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ORRF"}
