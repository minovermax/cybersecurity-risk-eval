Risk Factors\nThe foregoing discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this Report, have affected, or may in the future affect, our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations in a material and adverse manner.\nWe are affected by the level of demand in the construction industry.\nDemand for our construction products and building materials is directly related to the level of activity in the construction industry, which includes residential, commercial and infrastructure construction. While the most recent downturn in residential and commercial construction, which began in calendar 2007, materially affected our business, certain economic fundamentals began improving in calendar 2012, and have continued to improve; however, the rate and sustainability of such improvement remains uncertain. Infrastructure spending continues to be adversely affected by several factors, including the budget constraints currently being experienced by federal, state and local governments. Any decrease in the amount of government funds available for such projects or any decrease in construction activity in general (including any weakness in residential or commercial construction) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, and this causes our quarterly results to vary significantly.\nA majority of our business is seasonal with peak revenue and profits occurring primarily in the months of April through November when the weather in our markets is more suitable for construction activity. Quarterly results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future. Such variations could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the risk of unfavorable weather conditions, particularly during peak construction periods, as well as other unexpected operational difficulties.\nUnfavorable weather conditions, such as snow, cold weather, hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy or sustained rainfall, can reduce construction activity and adversely affect demand for construction products. Such weather conditions can also increase our costs, reduce our production, or impede our ability to transport our products in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Similarly, operational difficulties, such as business interruption due to required maintenance, capital improvement projects, or loss of power, can increase our costs and reduce our production. In particular, the occurrence of unfavorable weather conditions and other unexpected operational difficulties during peak construction periods could adversely affect operating earnings and cash flow and could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations for the full year.\nWe and our customers participate in cyclical industries and regional markets, which are subject to industry downturns.\nA majority of our revenue is from customers who are in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions. For example, many of our customers operate in the construction industry, which is affected by a variety of factors, such as general economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, levels of infrastructure spending, and other factors beyond our control. In addition, since our operations are in a variety of geographic markets, our businesses are subject to differing economic conditions in each such geographic market. Economic downturns in the industries to which we sell our products or localized downturns in the regions where we have operations generally have an adverse effect on demand for our products and negatively affect the collectability of our receivables. In general, any downturns in these industries or regions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of our products are commodities, which are subject to significant changes in supply and demand and price fluctuations.\nMany of the products sold by us are commodities, and competition among manufacturers is based largely on price. Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions, and other market conditions beyond our control. Increases in the production capacity of industry participants for products such as gypsum wallboard, frac sand, or cement or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. Currently, there continues to be significant excess nameplate capacity in the gypsum wallboard industry in the United States. There can be no assurance that prices for products sold by us will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our strategic portfolio review.\nOn April 18, 2019, we announced that the Company, with the support of our independent financial and legal advisors, is conducting a strategic review of its portfolio of businesses. The review is ongoing and the Company is carefully considering the full range of options for maximizing value to our shareholders, including a separation of our businesses, potential transactions with third parties and other strategic and financial alternatives. There can be no assurance that the strategic portfolio review will result in any particular action or that a transaction will be consummated, nor can there be any assurance regarding the timing of any action or transaction. We will incur expenses in connection with the strategic portfolio review and our future results may be affected by the pursuit or consummation of any specific transaction or other strategic alternative resulting from the review. While the strategic portfolio review is ongoing, we are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties, including potential risks and uncertainties in retaining and attracting employees during the review process; the diversion of management\u2019s time to the review; and exposure to potential litigation in connection with the review process or any specific transaction or other strategic alternative resulting therefrom, all of which could disrupt and negatively affect our business. Speculation regarding any developments related to the strategic portfolio review and perceived uncertainties related to the future of the Company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. As of the date of this filing, there is no definite timetable for completion of the strategic portfolio, and we can provide no assurance that any transaction or other strategic alternative we may pursue will have a positive impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest.\nOn May 8, 2019, Sachem Head Capital Management LP, a stockholder of the Company, submitted a notice to us proposing to nominate two individuals to stand for election to our board of directors at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, in opposition to the nominees to be proposed by our board of directors. This proxy contest will require the Company to incur significant fees and expenses, and absorb significant time and attention by management and the board of directors. Furthermore, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could serve as a disruption to our long-term strategic plan, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and impact our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome, or the impact on the Company, of this proxy contest.\nOur Cement business is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are sensitive to changes in volume.\nDue to the high levels of fixed capital required to produce cement, our profitability is susceptible to significant changes in volume. We believe that our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and our available financing resources will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property and machinery necessary to operate our cement business, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or incur additional debt. In addition, given the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs within our Cement business and at our cement production facilities, decreases in volume could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur Oil and Gas Proppants business and financial performance depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industries.\nOur operations that produce frac sand are materially dependent on the levels of activity in oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production. More specifically, the demand for the frac sand we produce is closely related to the number of oil and natural gas wells completed in geological formations where sand-based proppants are used in fracture treatments. These activity levels are affected by both short- and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices. In recent years, oil and natural gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development, and production activity, have experienced significant fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East, and initiatives by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price volatility. Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely affect the short-term demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for our products. Reduction in demand for natural gas to generate electricity could also adversely affect the demand for frac sand. A prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and well completion activity, and would result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce. In addition, any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could have material adverse effect on our Oil and Gas Proppants business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAny material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows, in particular with respect to our Oil and Gas Proppants business. Our contracts with our customers provide for different potential remedies to us in the event a customer fails to purchase the minimum contracted amount of product in a given period. If we were to pursue legal remedies in the event that a customer failed to purchase the minimum contracted amount of product under a fixed-volume contract or failed to satisfy the take-or-pay commitment under a take-or-pay contract, we may receive significantly less in a judgment or settlement of any claimed breach than we would have received had the customer fully performed under the contract. In the event of any customer\u2019s breach, we may also choose to renegotiate any disputed contract on less favorable terms (including with respect to price and volume) for us to preserve the relationship with that customer.\nVolatility and disruption of financial markets could affect access to credit.\nDifficult economic conditions can cause a contraction in the availability, and increase the cost, of credit in the marketplace. A number of our customers or suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by unsettled conditions in capital and credit markets, which in some cases have made it more difficult or costly for them to finance their business operations. These unsettled conditions have the potential to reduce the sources of liquidity for the Company and our customers.\nOur and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including environmental laws, which can be costly and burdensome.\nOur operations and those of our customers are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations with respect to such matters as land usage, street and highway usage, noise level, and health and safety and environmental matters. In many instances, various certificates, permits, or licenses are required in order for us or our customers to conduct business or carry out construction and related operations. Although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements or that demand for our products will not be adversely affected by regulatory issues affecting our customers. In addition, future developments, such as the discovery of new facts or conditions, the enactment or adoption of new or stricter laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, require additional investment by us, or prevent us from opening, expanding, or modifying plants or facilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFor example, greenhouse gases (GHGs) currently are regulated as pollutants under the federal Clean Air Act and subject to reporting and permitting requirements. Future consequences of GHG permitting requirements and potential emission reduction measures for our operations may be significant because (1) the cement manufacturing process requires the combustion of large amounts of fuel; (2) in our cement manufacturing process, the production of carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the calcination process, whereby carbon dioxide is removed from calcium carbonate to produce calcium oxide; and (3) our gypsum wallboard manufacturing process combusts a significant amount of fossil fuel, especially natural gas. In addition, the EPA has proposed to regulate GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants as a result of the EPA\u2019s promulgation of new source performance standards for the same sources. In the future, the EPA is expected to propose new source performance standards for GHG emissions from cement manufacturing, which similarly will trigger a requirement for the EPA to promulgate\nregulations relating to GHG emissions from existing cement manufacturing facilities. The timing of such regulation is uncertain.\nThe EPA finalized National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP, for portland cement plants (PC NESHAP). The PC NESHAP required a significant reduction in emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from portland cement kilns, including mercury, total hydrocarbons, particulate matter (as a surrogate for metal pollutants), and acid gases from cement kilns of all sizes. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review and revise these standards within eight years based on any residual risk posed by emissions from cement plants, as well as periodically review and revise these standards to account for developments in practices, process or control technologies. EPA determined on July 25, 2018, that no revisions to the PC NESHAP are necessary to address residual risk or technological developments. This determination has been challenged by environmental groups in Downwinders at Risk v. EPA, No. 18-1260 (D.C. Cir.). The litigation in the D.C. Circuit is being held in abeyance while EPA considers the environmental groups\u2019 administrative petition for reconsideration of the determination. In the future, the EPA may propose to further strengthen the emission limitations applicable under the PC NESHAP to reflect future technological developments. It is not possible at this time to predict whether or when such a rule making may be undertaken or whether it would have a material effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nOn March 21, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule revising the Standards of Performance for New Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources for Commercial/Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (the CISWI Rule) per Section 129 of the Clean Air Act, which created emission standards for four subcategories of industrial facilities, one of which is \u201cWaste Burning Kilns.\u201d The EPA simultaneously stayed the CISWI Rule for further reconsideration. On February 7, 2013, the EPA finalized revisions to the CISWI Rule. For those cement kilns that utilize non-hazardous secondary materials (NHSM) as defined in the rule first finalized on March 21, 2011 (and slightly revised on February 7, 2013), the CISWI Rule requires significant reductions in emissions of certain pollutants from applicable cement kilns. The CISWI Rule sets forth emission standards for mercury, carbon monoxide, acid gases, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, certain metals (lead and cadmium), particulate matter, and more stringent standards than the PC NESHAP for dioxin/furans. The CISWI Rule required existing CISWI units (i.e., those that began construction before June 4, 2010) to be in compliance with emission limits in their state-submitted plans by the earlier of February 7, 2018 or three years after the effective date of state plan approval by the EPA. The Rule requires new CISWI units (i.e., those that began construction on or after June 4, 2010, or commenced reconstruction or modification after August 7, 2013) to be in compliance with the emission standards for new sources by the later of August 7, 2013, or the date of startup of the source. On January 11, 2017, the EPA published a proposed federal plan that would implement the emission limits for existing CISWI units in states that have not submitted and received approval for a state plan; however, the Agency has yet to finalize the proposed federal plan. On June 23, 2016, the EPA published a final rule reconsidering four provisions of the February 7, 2013 CISWI Rule, including relaxing the particulate matter standard for solid waste-burning kilns and eliminating the affirmative defense to penalties for non-compliance during well-documented malfunction events.\nOn April 17, 2015, the EPA published its final rule addressing the storage, reuse, and disposal of coal combustion products, which include fly ash and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (synthetic gypsum). We use synthetic gypsum in wallboard manufactured at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. The rule, which applies only to electric utilities and independent power producers, establishes standards for the management of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which is the Subtitle that regulates non-hazardous wastes. The rule imposes requirements addressing CCR surface impoundments and landfills, including location restrictions, design and operating specifications, groundwater monitoring requirements, corrective action requirements,\nrecordkeeping and reporting obligations, and closure requirements. Beneficial encapsulated uses of CCRs, including synthetic gypsum, are exempt from regulation. The rule became effective on October 19, 2015, with many of the requirements phased in months or years after the effective date. Given the EPA\u2019s decision to continue to allow CCR to be used in synthetic gypsum and to regulate CCR under the non-hazardous waste sections of RCRA, we do not expect the rule to materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similarly, material effects for our business, financial condition and results of operations are unlikely to result from administrative reconsideration by the EPA of certain aspects of the final CCR rule, because none of these pending actions currently seek to overturn the management of CCR as non-hazardous waste or the regulatory exemption for beneficial encapsulated use of CCR.\nOn October 1, 2015, the EPA lowered the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) ozone standards from the prior 8-hour standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. An \u201carea\u201d (typically on the county level) will meet the ozone standards if the fourth-highest maximum daily 8-hour ozone concentration per year, averaged over three years, is equal to or less than 70 ppb. The EPA completed its area designations for all areas in the United States in July 2018. Areas with ozone levels above the standards were designated as \u201cnonattainment\u201d (with classifications ranging from marginal to extreme nonattainment), areas with ozone levels at or below the standards were designated as \u201cattainment/unclassifiable,\u201d and areas with insufficient data for EPA to make an attainment determination were designated as \u201cunclassifiable.\u201d In states with major emitting sources located in or near nonattainment areas, states are required to impose new and costly regulatory requirements. For areas that were determined to be in nonattainment, states are required to develop plans to bring the areas into attainment by as early as 2020 (depending on when the nonattainment designation was made and what the nonattainment classification is, e.g., marginal, moderate, severe, or extreme). Out of the 16 states where we have operations, 10 states contain at least one area that was designated as being in nonattainment for the 2015 ozone NAAQS (California, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin). We may be required to meet new control requirements requiring significant capital expenditures for compliance.\nOur cement plant located in Fernley, Nevada is subject to certain obligations under a consent decree with the United States requiring the establishment of facility-specific emissions limitations for certain air pollutants. Limitations that significantly restrict emissions levels beyond current operating levels may require additional investments by us or place limitations on operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur cement plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma is subject to a NESHAP for hazardous waste combustors (the HWC NESHAP), which imposes emission limitations and operating limits on cement kilns that are fueled by hazardous wastes. Compliance with the HWC NESHAP could impose additional liabilities on us or require additional investment by us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, new developments, such as new laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, require additional investment by us, or prevent us from operating or expanding plants or facilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For example, while the HWC NESHAP has not been updated since 2008, 73 Fed. Reg. 64068 (Oct. 28, 2008), future revisions to the HWC NESHAP regulations would apply to both of the cement kilns used at the cement plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Such revision could require new control requirements and significant capital expenditure for compliance.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely affect our business.\nA number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed, or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential effects of climate change. Such legislation or regulation has and potentially could include provisions for a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions. Any future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would likely have a negative impact on our business or results of operations, whether through the imposition of raw material or production limitations, fuel-use, or carbon taxes emission limitations or reductions, or otherwise.\nOther potential effects of climate change include physical effects such as disruption in production and product distribution as a result of major storm events and shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities. Production and shipment levels for our businesses correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes, and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect our businesses. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely affect the cost of purchased energy and electricity.\nThe effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, because a chemical reaction inherent to the manufacture of portland cement releases carbon dioxide, a GHG, cement kiln operations may be disproportionately affected by future regulation of GHGs. Climate change and legislation and regulation concerning GHGs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nSilica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nThe inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the frac sand industry and related transloading operations. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use or handling of frac sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers\u2019 use of our frac sand. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing, and handling frac sand could materially and adversely affect frac sand producers and those who transload frac sand, including us, through reduced use of frac sand, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers. We are currently subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including MSHA and OSHA, may continue to propose and implement changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. We may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted and required modifications or cessation of operations at our affected operations could have a material adverse effect on those businesses.\nWe may incur significant costs in connection with pending and future litigation.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including but not limited to personal injury, environmental, antitrust, tax, asbestos, property entitlements and land use, intellectual property, commercial, contract, product liability, health and safety, and employment matters. The outcome of pending or future lawsuits, claims, investigations, or proceedings is often difficult to\npredict and could be adverse and material in amount. Development in these proceedings can lead to changes in management\u2019s estimates of liabilities associated with these proceedings including the judge\u2019s rulings or judgments, settlements, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period. In addition, the defense of these lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant costs in defending these matters. See Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings of this report.\nOur results of operations are subject to significant changes in the cost and availability of fuel, energy and other raw materials.\nMajor cost components in each of our businesses are the costs of fuel, energy, and raw materials. Significant increases in the costs of fuel, energy, or raw materials, or substantial decreases in their availability could materially and adversely affect our sales and operating profits. Prices for fuel, energy, or raw materials used in connection with our businesses could change significantly in a short period of time for reasons outside our control. Prices for fuel and electrical power, which are significant components of the costs associated with our Gypsum Wallboard and Cement businesses, have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may increase in the future. In the event of large or rapid increases in prices, we may not be able to pass the increases through to our customers in full, which would reduce our operating margin.\nChanges in the cost or availability of raw materials supplied by third parties may adversely affect our operating and financial performance.\nWe generally maintain our own reserves of limestone, gypsum, aggregates, and other materials that we use to manufacture our products. However, we obtain certain raw materials used to manufacture our products, such as synthetic gypsum and slag granules, from third parties who produce such materials as by-products of industrial processes. While we try to secure our needed supply of such materials through long-term contracts, those contracts may not be sufficient to meet our needs, or we may be unable to renew or replace existing contracts when they expire or are terminated in the future. Should our existing suppliers cease operations or reduce or eliminate production of these by-products, our costs to procure these materials may increase significantly, or we may be obliged to procure alternatives to replace these materials, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any such development may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to significant cleanup, remediation, and other liabilities under applicable environmental laws.\nOur operations are subject to state, federal, and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts. These laws and regulations also require pollution control and prevention, site restoration and operating permits, and/or approvals to conduct certain of our operations or expand or modify our facilities. Certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations. We are unable to estimate accurately the impact on our business or results of operations of any such law or regulation at this time. Risk of environmental liability (including the incurrence of fines, penalties, other sanctions, or litigation liability) is inherent in the operation of our businesses. As a result, it is possible that environmental liabilities and compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future.\nSignificant changes in the cost and availability of transportation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSome of the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, such as coal or coke, are transported to our facilities by truck or rail. In addition, transportation logistics play an important part in allowing us to supply products to our customers, whether by truck, rail, or barge. For example, we deliver gypsum wallboard to many areas of the United States, and the transportation costs associated with the delivery of our wallboard products represent a significant portion of the variable cost of our Gypsum Wallboard segment. Significant increases in the cost of fuel or energy can result in material increases in the cost of transportation, which could materially and adversely affect our operating profits. In addition, reductions in the availability of certain modes of transportation, such as rail or trucking, could limit our ability to deliver product and therefore materially and adversely affect our operating profits.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants and require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests, which limit our flexibility and could give rise to a default if we are unable to remain in compliance.\nOur Credit Facility, Senior Unsecured Notes, and Series 2007A Senior Unsecured Notes contain, among other things, covenants that limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities, including but not limited to our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell assets or make other fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances or guarantees;\n\u2022\nencumber our assets or those of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, these agreements require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. Events beyond our control, including the changes in general business and economic conditions, may impair our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants or failure to maintain the required ratios and meet the required tests may result in an event of default under these agreements. This may allow the lenders under these agreements to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, terminate any commitments to extend further credit to us, and pursue other remedies available to them under the applicable agreements. If this occurs, our indebtedness may be accelerated, and we may not be able to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, or repay the accelerated indebtedness. In general, the occurrence of any event of default under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and reduce our profitability.\nOur future ability to satisfy our debt obligations is subject, to some extent, to financial, market, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Our substantial debt obligations could have negative consequences to our business, and, in particular, could impede, restrict, or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, or strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. If this occurs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, selling equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nas a result of the amount of our outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants to which we are subject, if we determine that we require additional financing to fund future working capital, capital investments, or other business activities, we may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nOur production facilities may experience unexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events, and scheduled maintenance.\nInterruptions in our production capabilities may cause our productivity and results of operations to decline significantly during the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment. Such equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, violent weather conditions, or unexpected operational difficulties. We also have periodically scheduled shut-downs to perform maintenance on our facilities. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue and profits due to lost production time, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in interest rates and inflation could adversely affect our business and demand for our products, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by the movement of interest rates. Interest rates have a direct impact on the level of residential, commercial, and infrastructure construction activity by impacting the cost of borrowed funds to builders. Higher interest rates could result in decreased demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, increases in interest rates could result in higher interest expense related to borrowings under our Credit Facility. Inflation can result in higher interest rates. With inflation, the costs of capital increase, and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation, which could have a direct and indirect adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nAny new business opportunities we may elect to pursue will be subject to the risks typically associated with the early stages of business development or product line expansion.\nWe are continuing to pursue opportunities which are natural extensions of our existing core businesses and which allow us to leverage our core competencies, existing infrastructure, and customer relationships. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Executive Summary.\u201d Our likelihood of success in pursuing and realizing these opportunities must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the early phases of business development or product line expansion, including the difficulties involved in obtaining permits; planning and constructing new facilities; transporting and storing products; establishing, maintaining, or expanding customer relationships; as well as navigating the regulatory environment in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in the pursuit and realization of these opportunities.\nWe may be adversely affected by decreases or shifts in demand for frac sand or the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.\nFrac sand is a proppant used in the completion and re-completion of oil and natural gas wells through hydraulic fracturing. Frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than ceramic proppant, which is also used in hydraulic fracturing to stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production. A significant shift in demand from frac sand to other proppants, such as ceramic proppants, or a shift in demand from higher-margin frac sand to lower-margin frac sand, could have a material adverse effect on our Oil and Gas Proppants business. The development and use of new technology for effective alternative proppants, or new technologies allowing for improved placement of proppants at reduced volumes, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether could also cause a decline in demand for the frac sand we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our Oil and Gas Proppants business. Similarly, the continued presence of lower cost in-basin frac sand in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins, could continue to adversely affect our Oil and Gas Proppants business.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining, and other permits, water rights, and approvals authorizing operations at many of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third parties to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, water rights, or approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot verify. A successful claim that we do not have title to one or more of our properties or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop, and extract any minerals on that property, without compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event one or more of our properties are determined to have title deficiencies.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our results of operations or financial conditions.\nA cyber-attack or data security breach affecting our information technology systems may negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe use information technology systems to collect, store, and transmit the data needed to operate our businesses, including our confidential and proprietary information. Although we have implemented industry-standard security safeguards and policies to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of such information, we cannot prevent all cyber-attacks or data security breaches. If such an attack or breach occurs, our businesses could be negatively affected, and we could incur additional costs in remediating the attack or breach and suffer reputational harm due to the theft or disclosure of our confidential information.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions that are intended to complement or expand our businesses. We may not be able to complete proposed transactions, and even if completed, the transactions may involve a number of risks that may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nAs business conditions warrant and our financial resources permit, we may pursue opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies and to form joint ventures that we believe could complement, enhance, or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty identifying appropriate opportunities, or if we do identify opportunities, we may not be successful in completing transactions for a number of reasons. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve one or more of a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired business or joint venture;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business or joint venture to achieve expected operational, profitability, and investment return objectives;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, asset devaluation, or restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unanticipated liabilities and costs for which indemnification is unavailable or inadequate;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve other intended objectives of the transaction.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain, and manage our newly acquired operations or their employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nOur bylaws include a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any internal corporate claims within the meaning of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), (ii) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (iii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or to our stockholders, or (iv) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, will be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our bylaws, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThis report includes various forward-looking statements, which are not facts or guarantees of future performance and which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nThis report and other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us contain or may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate to matters of a strictly factual or historical nature and generally discuss or relate to forecasts, estimates, or other expectations regarding future events. Generally, the words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccan,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, including statements related to expected operating and performing results, planned transactions, plans, and objectives of management, future developments, or conditions in the industries in which we participate, including future prices for our products, audits, and legal proceedings to which we are a party, and other trends, developments, and uncertainties that may affect our business in the future.\nForward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance but instead represent only our beliefs at the time the statements were made regarding future events, which are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are outside of our control. Any or all of the forward-looking statements made by us may turn out to be materially inaccurate. This can occur as a result of incorrect assumptions, changes in facts and circumstances, or the effects of known risks and uncertainties. Many of the risks and uncertainties mentioned in this report or other reports filed by us with the SEC, including those discussed in the risk factor section of this report, will be important in determining whether these forward-looking statements prove to be accurate. Consequently, neither our stockholders nor any other person should place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements and should recognize that actual results may differ materially from those that may be anticipated by us.\nAll forward-looking statements made in this report are made as of the date hereof, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from expectations expressed in this report will increase with the passage of time. We undertake no obligation, and disclaim any duty, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in our expectations, or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 89983, "SIC": 3270, "TIC": "EXP"}
