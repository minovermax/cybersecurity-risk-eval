{"cik": "1043337", "company": "STONERIDGE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is cyclical and a downturn in the automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets as well as overall economic conditions could reduce the sales and profitability of our business.\nThe demand for products in our Control Devices and Electronics segments are largely dependent on the domestic and foreign production of automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural vehicles. The markets for our products have been cyclical, because new vehicle demand is dependent on, among other things, consumer spending and is tied closely to the overall strength of the economy. Because the majority of our products are used principally in the production of vehicles for the automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets, our net sales, and therefore our results of operations, are significantly dependent on the general state of the economy and other factors which affect these markets. A decline in commercial, automotive, agricultural, motorcycle and off-highway vehicle production, or a material decline in market share by our significant customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2016, approximately 88% of our net sales were derived from automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets while approximately 12% were derived from aftermarket distributors, mass merchandisers and monitoring services markets.\nWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative effect on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results, including foreign currency forward contracts. To mitigate a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we use derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency contracts, to reduce the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions, inventory purchases and other foreign currency exposures.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nApproximately 38% of our net sales in 2016 were derived from sales outside of North America. At December 31, 2016, significant concentrations of net assets outside of North America included $55.7 million in South America and $79.0 million in Europe and Other. Non-current assets outside of North America accounted for approximately 51% of our non-current assets as of December 31, 2016. International sales and operations are subject to significant risks, including, among others:\n\u00b7 political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 restrictive trade policies;\n\u00b7 economic conditions in local markets;\n\u00b7 currency exchange controls;\n\u00b7 labor unrest;\n\u00b7 difficulty in obtaining distribution support and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7 the imposition of product tariffs and the burden of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export laws\nWe may not realize sales represented by awarded business.\nWe base our growth projections, in part, on business awards made by our customers. These business awards generally renew annually during a program life cycle. Failure of actual production orders from our customers to approximate these business awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe prices that we can charge some of our customers are predetermined and we bear the risk of costs in excess of our estimates, in addition to the risk of adverse effects resulting from general customer demands for cost reductions and quality improvements.\nOur supply agreements with some of our customers require us to provide our products at predetermined prices. In some cases, these prices decline over the course of the contract and may require us to meet certain productivity and cost reduction targets. In addition, our customers may require us to share productivity savings in excess of our cost reduction targets. The costs that we incur in fulfilling these contracts may vary substantially from our initial estimates. Unanticipated cost increases or the inability to meet certain cost reduction targets may occur as a result of several factors, including increases in the costs of labor, components or materials. In some cases, we are permitted to pass on to our customers the cost increases associated with specific materials. However, cost overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOEM customers have exerted and continue to exert considerable pressure on component suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality and provide additional design and engineering capabilities and continue to demand and receive price reductions and measurable increases in quality through their use of competitive selection processes, rating programs and various other arrangements. We may be unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset required price reductions. Additionally, OEMs have generally required component suppliers to provide more design engineering input at earlier stages of the product development process, the costs of which have, in some cases, been absorbed by the suppliers. Future price reductions, increased quality standards and additional engineering capabilities required by OEMs may reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive. We compete based on technological innovation, price, quality, performance, service and delivery. Many of our competitors are more diversified and have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, with respect to certain products, some of our competitors are divisions of our OEM customers. We cannot assure that our business will not be adversely affected by competition or that we will be able to maintain our profitability if the competitive environment changes.\nThe loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results.\nWe are dependent on several principal customers for a significant percentage of our net sales. In 2016, our top five customers were Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Scania Group, Daimler and Volvo which comprised 17%, 7%, 6%, 6% and 6% of our net sales, respectively. In 2016, our top ten customers accounted for 55% of our net sales. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The contracts we have entered into with many of our customers provide for supplying the customers\u2019 requirements for a particular model, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model. These contracts are subject to renegotiation, which may affect product pricing and generally may be terminated by our customers at any time. Therefore, the loss of a contract for a major model or a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or any group of related models sold by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing cash flows and our ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. We also compete to supply products for successor models and are subject to the risk that the customer will not select us to produce products on any such model, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we have significant receivable balances related to these customers and other major customers that would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy.\nThe discontinuation of, loss of business or lack of commercial success, with respect to a particular vehicle model for which the Company is a significant supplier could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm its profitability.\nAlthough the Company has purchase orders from many of its customers, these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer\u2019s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, it is possible that customers could elect to manufacture components internally that are currently produced by outside suppliers, such as the Company. The discontinuation of, the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which the Company is a significant supplier, could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm the Company\u2019s profitability.\nWe are dependent on the availability and price of raw materials and other supplies.\nWe require substantial amounts of raw materials and other supplies, and substantially all such materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials and other supplies may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers and interruptions in production by suppliers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, commercial disputes, acts of terrorism or war, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. If demand for raw materials increases, we may have difficulties obtaining adequate raw materials and other supplies from our suppliers to satisfy our customers. At times, we have experienced difficulty obtaining adequate supplies of semiconductors and memory chips for our Control Devices, Electronics and PST segments. In addition, there have been challenges at times in obtaining timely supply of nylon and resins for our Control Devices segment and audio component parts for our PST segment. If we cannot obtain adequate raw materials and other supplies, or if we experience an increase in the price of raw materials and other supplies, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe use a variety of commodities, including copper, zinc, resins and certain other commodities. Increasing commodity costs could have a negative impact on our results. We have sought at times to alleviate the effect of increasing costs by selectively hedging a portion of our exposure. The inability to effectively hedge them may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell certain products in the aftermarket sales channel and a disruption to this channel would harm our business.\nBecause we sell certain products such as security accessories and driver information products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. If dealers and distributors do not maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.\nOur dealer network also sells products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers more favorable terms, those dealers may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors, or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.\nWe must implement and sustain a competitive technological advantage in producing our products to compete effectively.\nOur products are subject to changing technology, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative products introduced by competitors. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customers\u2019 changing specifications with respect to technological innovation, price, quality, performance, service and delivery by implementing and sustaining competitive technological advances. Our business may, therefore, require significant recurring additional capital expenditures and investment in product development and manufacturing and management information systems. We cannot assure that we will be able to achieve the technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive. Our inability to continuously improve existing products, to develop new products and to achieve technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPST\u2019s Global Positioning Systems (\u201cGPS\u201d) products depend upon satellites maintained by the United States Department of Defense. If a significant number of these satellites become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, or if the policies of the United States government for the use of the GPS without charge are changed, our business will suffer.\nThe GPS is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage.\nIf a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our GPS products and the growth of market opportunities. In addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of GPS satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government that provide for the use of the GPS without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. Because of the increasing commercial applications of the GPS, other U.S. government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of GPS signals. Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select GPS-based products instead of products based on competing technologies, which could adversely affect our operational revenues, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may incur material product liability costs.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death and we cannot assure that we will not experience material product liability losses in the future. We cannot assure that our product liability insurance will be adequate for liabilities ultimately incurred or that it will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in government-imposed or customer OEM-instituted recalls involving such products. A successful claim brought against us that exceeds available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in any product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased or unexpected product warranty claims could adversely affect us.\nWe typically provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects and adhere to customer specifications. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated or compelled, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. We maintain warranty reserves in an amount based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims. To estimate the warranty reserves, we must forecast the resolution of existing claims, as well as expected future claims on products previously sold. The amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what we may ultimately be required to pay. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations, our financial condition or results of operations. Our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties, which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property or are found liable for infringing the rights of others, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and license agreements, are important in the operation of our businesses, and we rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the United States and other countries, as well as nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We may not, however, be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property, breaching any nondisclosure agreements with us, or independently developing technology that is similar or superior to ours and not covered by our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. We cannot assure that any intellectual property will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, rejected, cancelled, invalidated or declared unenforceable. In the case of pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing issued patents, or securing patents that provide us with a competitive advantage for our businesses. In addition, our competitors may design products around our patents that avoid infringement and violation of our intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be certain that we have rights to use all intellectual property used in the conduct of our businesses or that we have complied with the terms of agreements by which we acquire such rights, which could expose us to infringement, misappropriation or other claims alleging violations of third party intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted and may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims regarding intellectual property rights of others, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our resources. Any such claims and resulting litigation could require us to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all), pay damages and cease making or selling certain products and could result in a loss of our intellectual property protection. Moreover, we may need to redesign some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. We also may be required to indemnify customers or other third parties at significant expense in connection with such claims and actions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and expose us to risks.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there was $67.0 million in borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). In addition, we are permitted under our Credit Facility to incur additional debt, subject to specified limitations. Our leverage and the terms of our indebtedness may have important consequences including the following:\n\u00b7 we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, an event of default could result;\n\u00b7 we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate activities;\n\u00b7 covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate activities;\n\u00b7 covenants relating to our debt may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7 we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors\nThese and other consequences of our leverage and the terms of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCovenants in our Credit Facility may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur Credit Facility limits our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt and guarantees;\n\u00b7 pay dividends and repurchase our shares;\n\u00b7 make other restricted payments, including investments;\n\u00b7 create liens;\n\u00b7 sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital shares of subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7 substantially change the nature of our business.\nThe agreement governing our Credit Facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and places a maximum annual limit on capital expenditures. Our ability to comply with these covenants as well as the negative covenants under the terms of our indebtedness, may be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of any of the negative covenants under our indebtedness or our inability to comply with the leverage and interest ratio requirements in the Credit Facility could result in a default. If a default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facility could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, and the Credit Facility lenders could pursue foreclosure and other remedies against us and our assets.\nWe have limited or no redundancy for certain of our manufacturing facilities, and therefore damage or disruption to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.\nIf certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, we may be unable to meet production requirements, we may lose revenue and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our customers. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply. Although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations and may be insufficient. Also, our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nA failure of our information technology (IT) networks and systems, or the inability to successfully implement upgrades to our enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and/or activities. The secure operation of these information technology networks and systems and the proper processing and maintenance of this information are critical to our business operations. Despite the implementation of security measures, our IT systems are at risk to damages from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed or lost. Any such access, disclosure, loss of information or disruption of our operations could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nAlso, we continually expand and update our IT networks and systems in response to the changing needs of our business and periodically upgrade our ERP systems. Should our networks or systems not be implemented successfully, or if the systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner once implementation is complete, our business and operations could be disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.\nCompliance with environmental and other governmental regulations could be costly and require us to make significant expenditures.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things:\n\u00b7 the discharge of pollutants into the air and water;\n\u00b7 the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste and other materials;\n\u00b7 the cleanup of contaminated properties; and\n\u00b7 the health and safety of our employees.\nOur business, operations and facilities are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines for violations. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these operations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and requirements or other governmental regulations could increase our cost of doing business or adversely affect the demand for our products.\nOur annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in the mix of earnings and other factors including changes in the recognition and/or release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets.\nOur overall effective tax rate is computed by dividing our total tax expense (benefit) by our total earnings (loss) before tax. However, tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis, but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in certain jurisdictions may not provide a current financial statement tax benefit as a result of the need to maintain a valuation allowance against the associated deferred tax asset. Also, management periodically evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets which may result in the recognition and/or release of valuation allowances. As a result, changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions and changes in the recognition and/or release of valuation allowances, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate.\nThe impact of potential changes in tax and trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe U.S. government has recently proposed comprehensive tax and trade reform. These proposals are designed to encourage increased production in the United States and include a border tax on imports, an increase in customs duties and the renegotiation of U.S. trade agreements. Reflective of the automotive industry, our vehicle parts manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico are highly dependent on trade within the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) region. Our facility in Mexico represents a critical component of our supply chain and that of our customers. We have significant imports into the United States, and the imposition of a border tax or an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact our financial performance. If such taxes or customs duties are implemented, it also may cause our trading partners to take actions with respect to U.S. imports or U.S. investment activities in their respective countries. Any potential changes in tax and trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our business or may otherwise be unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions.\nFailure to successfully identify, complete and/or integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on us. A portion of our growth in sales and earnings has been generated from acquisitions and subsequent improvements in the performance of the businesses acquired. We expect to continue a strategy of selectively identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products. We cannot assure you that any business acquired by us will be successfully integrated with our operations or prove to be profitable. We could incur substantial indebtedness in connection with our acquisition strategy, which could significantly increase our interest expense.\nWe anticipate that acquisitions could occur in foreign markets in which we do not currently operate. As a result, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Any failure to successfully integrate such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85440, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "SRI"}
