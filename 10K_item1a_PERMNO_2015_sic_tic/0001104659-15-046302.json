{"cik": "930775", "company": "ENCISION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below. If any of the following risk factors actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment. You should look at all these risk factors in total. Some risk factors may stand on their own. Some risk factors may affect (or be affected by) other risk factors. You should not assume we have identified these connections. You should not assume that we will always update these and future risk factors in a timely manner. We are not undertaking any obligation to update these risk factors to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nAmong the factors that could cause future results and financial condition to be materially different from expectations are:\nOur products may not be accepted by the market. The success of our products and our financial condition depends on the acceptance of AEM products by the medical community in commercially viable quantities during fiscal year 2016 and beyond. We cannot predict how quickly or how broadly AEM products will be accepted by the medical community. We need to continually educate the marketplace about the potential hazards involved in the use of conventional electrosurgical products during MIS procedures and the expected benefits associated with the use of AEM products. If we are unsuccessful in educating the marketplace about our technology and the hazards of conventional instruments, we will not create sufficient demand by hospitals and surgeons for AEM products and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe need to continually develop and train our network of direct and independent sales representatives and expand our distribution efforts in order to be successful. Our attempts to develop and train a network of direct and independent sales representatives in the U.S. and to expand our international distribution efforts may take longer than expected and may result in considerable amounts of retraining effort as the direct and independent sales representatives change their product lines, product focus and personnel. We may not be able to obtain full coverage of the U.S. by direct and independent sales representatives as quickly as anticipated. The independent sales representative network has inherent flaws and inefficiencies, which can include conflicts of interest and competing products. Optimizing the quality of the network and the performance of direct and independent sales representatives in the U.S. is an ongoing challenge. We may also encounter difficulties in developing our international presence due to regulatory issues and our ability to successfully develop international distribution options. Our inability to expand our network of direct and independent sales representatives and optimize their performance could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may need additional funding to support our operations. We were formed in 1991 and have incurred losses of approximately $20 million since that date. We have primarily financed research, development and operational activities with issuances of our common stock and warrants, the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock, stock-based expense related to stock options and, in some years, by operating profits. At March 31, 2015, we had $258,656 in cash available to fund future operations and, in addition, access to a line of credit for approximately $517,000. We may find that investment in sales, marketing, research and development initiatives, merited by market opportunity, may result in our operating at a net loss from quarter to quarter. We may also find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage due to our constrained liquidity. On December 17, 2013, we completed a private placement of 2,463,125 shares of our common stock. The private placement raised, before costs, a total of $1,970,500. The purchase price per share for the shares sold in the private placement was $0.80, representing a discount of approximately 12% based on a 20-day volume-weighted average price as of December 13, 2013. Additionally, the investors received common stock purchase warrants. The warrants are exercisable into 1,231,563 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock with an exercise price of $1.20 per share and a term of five years. On May 29, 2015, we signed an amendment to our credit facility agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The terms of the credit facility include a line of credit for $2,000,000 for one year at an interest rate calculated at the prime rate plus 1.25%, subject to increase upon a default. The liquidity ratio covenant of the agreement limits our borrowing under the credit facility by a ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0 of our eligible receivables plus cash, minus accounts payable that are over sixty days, at the time of borrowing. As of March 31, 2015, we had $64,000 of borrowings from the credit facility and, under our liquidity ratio limit, had an additional approximately $517,000 available to borrow. The credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants. If we fail to comply with the restrictions contained in the credit facility and the lender does not waive such noncompliance, the resulting event of default could result in the lender accelerating the repayment of all outstanding amounts due under the credit facility or in our ability to receive additional funds under the credit facility. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining alternative sources of funding to repay these obligations should this event occur. In addition, should we need additional financing, we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current manufacturers of conventional (\u201cunshielded, unmonitored\u201d) electrosurgical instruments or against competitors who manufacture products that are based on surgical technologies that are alternatives to monopolar electrosurgery. The electrosurgical products market is intensely competitive. We expect that manufacturers of \u201cunshielded, unmonitored\u201d electrosurgical instruments will resist any loss of market share that might result from the presence of our \u201cshielded and monitored\u201d instruments in the marketplace. We also believe that manufacturers of products that are based upon surgical technologies that are alternatives to monopolar electrosurgery are our competitors. These technologies include bipolar electrosurgery, the harmonic scalpel and lasers. The alternative technologies may gain market share and new competitive technologies may be developed and introduced. Most of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do. Most of our competitors also currently have substantial customer bases in the medical products market and have significantly greater market recognition than we have. As a result of these factors, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. It is possible that new competitors or new alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. The competitive pressures we face may materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and this may hinder our ability to respond to competitive threats.\nIf we do not continually enhance our products and keep pace with rapid technological changes, we may not be able to attract and retain customers. Our future success and financial performance will depend in part on our ability to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of customers through the timely development and successful introduction of product upgrades, enhancements and new products. These upgrades, enhancements and new products are subject to significant technological risks. The medical device market is subject to rapid technological change, resulting in frequent new product introductions and enhancements of existing products, as well as the risk of product obsolescence. While we are currently developing new products and enhancing our existing product lines, we may not be successful in completing the development of new products or enhancements. In addition, we must respond effectively to technological changes by continuing to enhance our existing products to incorporate emerging or evolving standards. We may not be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that\nrespond to technological changes or evolving industry standards. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of those products, and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve commercially viable levels of market acceptance. If any potential new products, upgrades, or enhancements are delayed, or if any potential new products, upgrades, or enhancements experience quality problems or do not achieve market acceptance, or if new products make our existing products obsolete, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.\nIf government regulations change or if we fail to comply with existing and/or new regulations, we might miss market opportunities and experience increased costs and limited growth. The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products in the United States and other countries are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices must receive clearance from the Food and Drug Administration through the Section 510(k) pre-market notification process or through the more lengthy pre-market approval process before they can be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy and has required the expenditure of substantial resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain the necessary approvals. As part of our strategy, we also intend to pursue commercialization of our products in international markets. Our products are subject to regulations that vary from country to country. The process of obtaining foreign regulatory approvals in certain countries can be lengthy and require the expenditure of substantial resources. We may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis or at all, and delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing of our products, we could be subject to fines, suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory approvals, product recalls, suspension of manufacturing, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The manufacturing of our products is subject to extensive regulatory requirements administered by the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. Inspection of our manufacturing facilities and processes can be conducted at any time, without prior notice, by the Food and Drug Administration and such regulatory agencies. In addition, future changes in regulations or interpretations made by the Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agencies, with possible retroactive effect, could adversely affect us. Changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations or policies could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals or clearances. We may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis in the future, or at all. Delays in receipt of, failure to receive such approvals or clearances and/or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur current patents, trade secrets and know-how may not provide a competitive advantage, the pending applications may not result in patents being issued, and our competitors may design around any patents issued to us. Our success will continue to depend in part on our ability to maintain patent protection for our products and processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have 11 issued U.S. patents on several technologies embodied in our AEM Monitoring System, AEM Instruments and related accessories and we have applied for additional U.S. patents. In addition, we have four issued foreign patents. The validity and breadth of claims coverage in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and may be highly uncertain. Also, patents may not protect our proprietary information and know-how or provide adequate remedies for us in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, and others may be able to develop competing technology, independent of such information. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope or validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Any such claims may require us to incur substantial litigation expenses and to divert substantial time and effort of management personnel and could substantially decrease the amount of capital available for our operations. An adverse determination in litigation involving the proprietary rights of others could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products. The occurrence of any such actual or threatened litigation or the effect on our business of such litigation may materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our assessment that a patent is no longer of value could result in a significant charge against our earnings.\nWe depend on single source suppliers for certain of the key components of our products and sub-contractors to provide much of the materials used in the manufacturing of our products. The loss of a supplier or limitation in supply from existing suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is located. Although we believe that there are alternative suppliers, any interruption in the supply of key components could have a material adverse effect on us. A sudden increase in customer demand may create a backorder situation as lead times for some of our critical materials are in excess of 12 weeks. We rely on subcontractors to provide products, either in the form of finished goods or sub-assemblies that we then assemble and test. While these sub-contractors reduce our total cost of manufacturing, they may not be as responsive to increased demand as we would be if we had our manufacturing capacity entirely in-house, which may limit our growth strategy and sales.\nThe potential fluctuation in future quarterly results may cause our stock price to fluctuate. We expect that our operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future and will depend upon a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. These factors include the extent to which our AEM technology and related accessories gain market acceptance; our investments in marketing, sales, research and development and administrative personnel necessary to support growth; our ability to expand our market share; actions of competitors; and, general economic conditions. The market value of our common stock has dramatically fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Any of these factors, or factors not listed, could have an immediate and significant negative impact on the market price of our stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, the prices at which it trades are volatile and the buying or selling actions of a few shareholders may adversely affect our stock price. As of May 31, 2015, we had a public float, which is defined as shares outstanding minus shares held by our officers, directors, or beneficial holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, of 5,596,028 shares, or 52% of our outstanding common stock. The average number of shares traded in any given day over the past year has been relatively small compared to the public float. Thus, the actions of a few shareholders either buying or selling shares of our common stock may adversely affect the price of the\nshares. Historically, thinly-traded securities such as our common stock have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that do not necessarily relate to operating performance.\nProduct liability claims may exceed our current insurance coverage. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects to a patient. We maintain a general liability insurance policy up to the amount of $5,000,000 that includes coverage for product liability claims. Liability claims may be excluded from the policy, may exceed the coverage limits of the policy, or the insurance may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Consequently, a product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on certain key personnel. We are highly dependent on a limited number of key management personnel, particularly our President and CEO, Gregory J Trudel. Our loss of key personnel to death, disability or termination, or our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.", "PERMNO": 83654, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ECIA"}
