Risk Factors\nOur consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Form 10-K. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which is frequently difficult, expensive and time-consuming with which to comply; noncompliance could adversely affect our operations and efforts to grow our business results.\nThe regulated waste management and secure information destruction industries are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the collection, transportation, packaging, labeling, handling, documentation, reporting, treatment and disposal of regulated waste and the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information. Our business requires us to obtain many permits, authorizations, approvals, certificates, and other types of governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Federal, state and local regulations change often, and new regulations are frequently adopted. Changes in the regulations could require us to obtain new permits or to change the way in which we operate our business. We might be unable to obtain the new permits that we require, and the cost of compliance with new or changed regulations could be significant.\nMany of the permits that we require, especially those to build and operate processing plants and transfer facilities, are difficult and time-consuming to obtain. They may also contain conditions or restrictions that limit our ability to operate efficiently, and they may not be issued as quickly as we need them (or at all). If we cannot obtain the permits, or if they contain unfavorable conditions, it could substantially impair our operations and reduce our revenues and/or profitability.\nIf we encounter regulatory compliance issues in the course of operating our businesses, we may experience adverse publicity, which may intensify if such non-compliance results in civil or criminal liability. This adverse publicity may harm our reputation, and result in difficulties in attracting new customers, or retaining existing customers.\nThe level of governmental enforcement of environmental regulations has an uncertain effect on our business and could reduce the demand for our services.\nWe believe that strict enforcement of laws and regulations relating to regulated waste collection and treatment and the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information by governmental authorities can have a positive effect on our business. These laws and regulations increase the demand for our services. Relaxation of enforcement or other changes in governmental regulation of regulated waste and personal and confidential information could increase the number of competitors we face or reduce the need for our services.\nUnfavorable market conditions, including those driven by economic or social trends, may impact the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information we collect from customers.\nThe compliance-based services we provide rely on the generation of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information by our customers. The amount of material generated by our customers may be impacted by macro-economic trends associated with manufacturing and industrial markets, healthcare market dynamics, and trends associated with electronic and digital record keeping. Many of our services are provided on a subscription basis with a monthly fee to minimize short-term or cyclical variability\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 17\nPART I\nassociated with these factors. However, some of our services are provided on a transactional basis, and long-term trends resulting from these factors could reduce the demand for our services, whether we provide them on a subscription or transactional basis.\nWe may experience difficulties executing on our multiyear Business Transformation.\nWe began a comprehensive, multiyear Business Transformation during the third quarter of 2017 with the intent of implementing a global EPM operating model. This new operating model is expected to standardize global end-to-end processes, align the company around key performance indicators, improve data management and decision making, and improve the Company\u2019s profitability. A global ERP system is the central component of our Business Transformation and will become the backbone of our performance management model. With an ERP, we will integrate all of our services lines and geographies onto one operating system. In addition to the implementation of a best-in-class system, there are five key initiatives of the Business Transformation which include: portfolio rationalization, operational optimization, organizational excellence and efficiency, commercial excellence, and strategic sourcing.\nThere is no assurance that the Business Transformation will achieve the anticipated benefits that we expect. Further, the ERP platform will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If the execution of our Business Transformation fails to achieve its intended benefits, our business, financial condition, and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nRestrictions in our private placement notes and our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions and value of our securities.\nOur private placement notes and Credit Agreement contain customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements; certain financial covenants; notices of default and certain other material events; payment of obligations; preservation of corporate existence, rights, privileges, permits, licenses, franchises and intellectual property; maintenance of property and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of liens, investments and indebtedness; mergers and certain other fundamental changes; dispositions of assets; restricted payments; changes in our line of business; transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the private placement notes and our Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with these provisions could result in a default or an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate its commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause its loans to become due and payable in full and force us and our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our stock could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 18\nPART I\nServicing debt and funding other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, upon:\n\u2022\nfuture operating performance;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ncompetition; and\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and business.\nSome of these factors are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe amount of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $2.75 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including long-term debt and short-term debt and not reduced by unamortized debt issuance costs. We also have the ability to incur additional indebtedness subject to our financial covenants.\nOur leverage could have adverse consequences on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our available cash to payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to access credit markets on terms we deem acceptable may be impaired; and\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.\nRisks from our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have established operations in the United States and 20 other countries. Foreign operations carry special risks including:\n\u2022\nexchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nsubstantial inflation in certain markets;\n\u2022\ndependence in certain markets on government entities as customers;\n\u2022\ndelays in the collection of accounts receivable related to certain government funding practices;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in or compliance with U.S., local or other applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations concerning anti-corruption, anti-bribery (i.e. U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), global trade, trade sanctions, competition, privacy and data protection;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022\nindustry or macro-economic trends;\n\u2022\npermitting and regulatory standards;\n\u2022\ndifferences in local laws, regulations, practices, and business customs;\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 19\nPART I\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States or movement of funds to other countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nincreases and volatility in labor costs; and\n\u2022\nproperty ownership restrictions in certain countries.\nAny of the foregoing or other factors associated with doing business abroad could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face continuing risks relating to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nOn June 12, 2017, the SEC issued a subpoena to the Company, requesting documents and information relating to the Company\u2019s compliance with the FCPA or other foreign or domestic anti-corruption laws with respect to certain of the Company\u2019s operations in Latin America. In addition, the Department of Justice has notified the Company that it is investigating this matter in parallel with the SEC. The Company is cooperating with these agencies. The Company is also conducting an internal investigation of these and other matters, including outside of Latin America, under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the assistance of outside counsel, and this investigation has found evidence of improper conduct. These matters (and other matters which may arise or of which we become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Such determinations could subject us to, among other things, enforcement actions by the SEC or the DOJ or other regulatory bodies, fines, penalties, or litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 18 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.\nWe are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits and may be named as a defendant in future lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 18 - Legal Proceedings in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.\nChanging market conditions in the healthcare industry, including healthcare consolidation and healthcare reform, could drive down our profits and slow our growth.\nWithin the United States, the healthcare industry is evolving to meet competing demands for increased healthcare coverage of a growing and aging population and economic pressures to reduce healthcare costs. As a result of these dynamics, hospital networks are consolidating physician practices into their networks, independent practices are consolidating together, and healthcare providers are focused on cutting costs within their businesses. These changes exert downward pricing pressure on services that we\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 20\nPART I\nprovide to healthcare customers which could adversely affect our profitability and growth. Commitments made in connection with the settlement of the MDL Action, as discussed in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 18 - Legal Proceedings may affect our ability to increase prices in the future and a deterioration in our customer relationships as a result of the MDL Action may affect our ability to sell additional services to our customers, both of which could adversely affect our profitability and growth.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors could drive down our profits and slow our growth.\nThe industries in which we participate are very competitive because of low barriers to entry, among other reasons. This competition has required us in the past to reduce our prices to our customers, may require us to reduce our prices in the future or may affect our ability to increase prices in the future. Substantial price reductions or our inability to increase prices could significantly reduce our earnings.\nWe face direct competition from a large number of small, local competitors. Because it requires very little financial investment to compete in the collection and transportation of regulated wastes or the secure destruction of personal and confidential information, there are many regional and local companies in these industries. We face competition from these businesses, and competition from them is likely to exist in new locations to which we may expand in the future. In addition, large national companies with substantial resources operate in the markets we serve. For example, in the United States, Waste Management, Inc., Clean Harbors, and Iron Mountain all offer competing services.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, including remediating known material weaknesses in our internal controls as of December 31, 2017, we may not be able to report our financial results timely and accurately or prevent fraud, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our company, our results of operations and our stock price.\nAs disclosed in more detail in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Report, we have identified certain material weaknesses as of December 31, 2017, in our internal controls over financial reporting. Due to these material weaknesses, we have also concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2017, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Our management has taken action to remediate these material weaknesses, as discussed in more detail under Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Report, and is committed to continue investing significant time and resources and taking actions to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as we work to further integrate acquisitions, streamline disparate information technology systems, and enhance our control environment. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and result in material misstatements in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements.\nAttacks on our information technology systems could damage our reputation, negatively impact our businesses and expose us to litigation risk.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. We rely heavily on various proprietary and third party information systems. Our reputation for the secure\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 21\nPART I\nhandling of customer and other sensitive information is critical to the success of our business. Although we have implemented safeguards and taken steps to prevent potential cyber incidents and security breaches, our preventative measures may not be entirely effective as the information technology and network infrastructure may still be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance, computer viruses, power outages, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or other disruptions. A cybersecurity incident and breach of our information systems could lead to theft, destruction, misappropriation or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property which could result in business disruption, negative publicity, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, brand damage, adverse financial and operational results, and potential litigation.\nOur management depends on relevant and reliable information for decision making purposes, including key performance indicators and financial reporting. A lack of relevant and reliable information could preclude us from optimizing our overall performance. Any significant loss of data, failure to maintain reliable data, disruptions affecting our information systems, or delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our businesses without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. If our information systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brands and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nFluctuations in the commodity market related to the demand and price for recycled paper may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell nearly all of the shredded paper from our secure information destruction business to paper companies and recycled paper brokers. Sorted office paper is marketed as a commodity and is subject to significant demand and price fluctuations beyond our control. Historically, economic and market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices, sales volume and margins for pulp and paper products. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. The overall levels of demand for the pulp and paper products, and consequently its sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and worldwide, as well as increasing use of digitalization. As a result, the market demand for recycled paper can be volatile due to factors beyond our control. Lack of demand for our shredded paper material could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant charges as a result of our portfolio optimization strategy; our portfolio optimization strategy may not achieve the desired results.\nAs part of our long-term strategy for improving our profitability and return on invested capital, we continue to evaluate the performance of our entire portfolio of assets and businesses. Based on this evaluation, we may sell certain assets or businesses or exit particular markets. Any divestitures resulting from this strategy may cause us to record significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, divestitures we complete may not yield the targeted improvements in our business. Any charges that we are required to record or the failure to achieve the intended financial results associated with our portfolio optimization strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 22\nPART I\nA change or deterioration in our relations with our employees or an increase in labor and employment costs could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor and employment is one of our highest costs and increases in employment costs could materially affect our cost structure and our profitability. We compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified employees and the labor supply is sometimes tight in our markets. A shortage of qualified employees or further unionization would require us to incur additional costs related to wages and benefits; inefficiencies in operations; unanticipated costs in sourcing temporary or third party labor; legal fees and interference with customer relationships.\nThe Company is a party to 15 collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and Canada, covering approximately 645 employees, or approximately 4.0%, of our total U.S. and Canadian workforce. These agreements expire on a scheduled basis depending upon the negotiated length of the contract\u2019s term. Collective bargaining agreement negotiations occur every year depending upon which agreements expire and whether one or both parties seek the modification of terms.\nWhile we believe the Company will maintain good working relations with its employees on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of future agreements with unions in a manner acceptable to the Company. There is also no guarantee that current non-union employees will not seek union representation resulting in additional collective bargaining agreements with associated increased costs to the Company. Potential work disruptions from labor disputes may disrupt our businesses and adversely affect our brand, customer relations, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to acquire regulated waste, secure information destruction and other businesses, our revenue and profit growth may be slowed.\nHistorically, our growth strategy has been based in part on our ability to acquire and integrate other businesses. We do not know whether in the future we will be able to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable businesses to buy;\n\u2022\ncomplete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us; and\n\u2022\navoid or overcome any concerns expressed by regulators.\nWe compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of regulated waste and secure information destruction companies and other businesses. This competition may result in fewer opportunities to purchase companies that are for sale. It may also result in higher purchase prices for the businesses that we want to purchase.\nWe also do not know whether our growth strategy will continue to be effective. Our business is significantly larger than before, and new acquisitions may not have the incremental benefits that we have obtained in the past.\nThe implementation of our acquisition strategy could be affected in certain instances by the concerns of federal, state and foreign regulators, which could result in our not being able to realize the full synergies or profitability of particular acquisitions.\nWe may become subject to inquiries and investigations by federal, state or foreign antitrust or other regulators from time to time in the course of completing acquisitions of other regulated waste and secure information destruction businesses. In order to obtain regulatory clearance for a particular acquisition, we could be required to modify certain operating practices of the acquired business or to divest ourselves of one or more assets of the acquired business. Changes in the terms of our acquisitions required by\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 23\nPART I\nregulators or agreed to by us in order to settle regulatory investigations could impede our acquisition strategy or reduce the anticipated synergies or profitability of our acquisitions. The likelihood and outcome of inquiries and investigations from federal, state or foreign regulators in the course of completing acquisitions cannot be predicted.\nWe may not realize the synergies and growth opportunities that are anticipated from acquisitions.\nThe benefits we expect to achieve as a result of acquisitions that we complete will depend, in part, on our ability to realize targeted synergies and anticipated growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these synergies and growth opportunities, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of other business and operations with our pre-existing business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate these businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies and growth opportunities we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all.\nWe will incur integration costs in connection with our acquisition strategy.\nOur business strategy includes growth through acquisition. Each acquisition includes a detailed execution plan to integrate the acquired operations into Stericycle\u2019s existing infrastructure to achieve synergies. We expect to incur costs to implement such cost savings measures. We anticipate that we will incur certain non-recurring charges in connection with this integration, including costs and charges associated with integrating operations, processes and systems. We cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges. The significant acquisition-related integration costs could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. We believe that synergies will come from the elimination of duplicative costs such as selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses such as the optimization of logistics, truck and plant utilization, improvements in route density and facility optimization, and contact center efficiencies. We also believe such synergies will offset incremental acquisition-related costs over time, but this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nMarket conditions could adversely change and our earnings could decline resulting in charges to impair intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nAs a result of our various acquisitions, the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017 contains goodwill of $3.60 billion and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $1.79 billion. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we evaluate on an ongoing basis whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment to the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets such as goodwill. As circumstances after an acquisition can change, we may not realize the value of these intangible assets. During 2017, we wrote off $21.0 million of permits, tradenames and customer relationships due to Operational Optimization. We also recognized a $65.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our Latin America reporting unit. We recognized this impairment due to a reduction of forecasted future cash flows in Latin America as discussed in the Impairment section of Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The recognition of these impairments, or potential future impairments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe handling of regulated waste exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nAs a company engaged in regulated waste management, we face risks of liability for environmental contamination. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws impose strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on the businesses that\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 24\nPART I\ngenerate those substances and the businesses that transport them to the facilities. Responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and clean-up costs even if they operated their businesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several, which means that if we were found to be a business with responsibility for a particular CERCLA site, we could be required to pay the entire cost of the investigation and clean-up even though we were not the party responsible for the release of the hazardous substance and even though other companies might also be liable.\nOur pollution liability insurance excludes liabilities under CERCLA. Thus, if we were to incur liability under CERCLA and if we could not identify other parties responsible under the law whom we are able to compel to contribute to our expenses, the cost to us could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity. Our customer service agreements make clear that the customer is responsible for making sure that only appropriate materials are disposed of. If there were a claim against us that a customer might be legally liable for, we might not be successful in recovering our damages from the customer.\nTax interpretations and changes in tax regulations and legislation could adversely affect us.\nTax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities. Tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us that may be challenged by the taxation authorities upon audit. Although we believe our assumptions, judgements and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to the provisional estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition tax, including impacts from changes to current year earnings and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries.\nWe face risks associated with project work and services that are provided on a non-recurring basis.\nWhile the majority of our business is based on long-term contracts for regularly scheduled service, we do have a portion of revenue which is derived from short-term projects or services that we provide on a non-recurring basis. Product recall and retrieval events, one-time purge events for secure information destruction, and certain hazardous waste services that we provide on a project or non-recurring basis are not predictable in terms of frequency, size or duration. Our customers\u2019 need for these services could be influenced by regulatory changes, fluctuations in commodity market performance, natural disasters and acts of God, or other factors beyond our control. Variability in the demand for these services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 25\nPART I\nThe handling and treatment of regulated waste carries with it the risk of personal injury to employees and others.\nOur business requires our employees to handle materials that may be infectious or hazardous to life and property in other ways. While we try to handle such materials with care and in accordance with accepted and safe methods, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills, and acts of God always exists.\nExamples of incidents that may present possible exposure to hazardous materials include:\n\u2022\ntruck accidents;\n\u2022\ndamaged or leaking containers;\n\u2022\nimproper storage of regulated waste by customers;\n\u2022\nimproper placement by customers of materials into the waste stream that we are not authorized or able to process, such as certain body parts and tissues; or\n\u2022\nmalfunctioning treatment plant equipment (i.e. power outages, ineffective backup systems).\nHuman beings, animals or property could be injured, sickened or damaged by exposure to regulated waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us.\nWhile we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, particular instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.\nThe handling of secure information for destruction exposes us to potential data security risks that could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment in the United States and Canada surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Certain legislation, including the FACTA, the HIPAA, the Economic Espionage Act in the United States, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada and the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, require documents to be securely destroyed to avoid identity theft and inadvertent leakage of confidential and sensitive information. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. In addition, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws or are expected to do so. The continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request us to take additional measures to enhance security and/or assume higher liability under our contracts. As a result of legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations to further improve data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operational complexity, and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe participate in multi-employer pension plans administered by employer and union trustees. To the extent that those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (\"ERISA\"), may subject us to substantial liabilities in the event we, whether partially or totally, cease to have obligations to contribute to the plans. Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit plans, circumstances such as a\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 26\nPART I\nplan's termination, an employer's partial or complete withdrawal from, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from, an underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan can trigger our obligation to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi-employer plan's unfunded vested liabilities. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as \"endangered,\" \"seriously endangered,\" or \"critical\" status. If plans in which we participate are in critical status or underfunded, we could be required to make additional contributions.\nBased upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of March 31, 2017, certain of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate are underfunded. The Pension Protection Act requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We have been notified that certain plans are in \"critical\" status and these plans may require additional contributions. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will be based on future levels of employee work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans. Additional funding could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. For more information, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 11 - Retirement and Other Employee Benefit Programs in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncreases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business and reduce our earnings.\nWe maintain a vast transportation network and an extensive fleet of transportation vehicles. A significant increase in market prices for trucks or fuel could adversely affect our business through higher transportation costs and reduce our operating margins and reported earnings.\nSome of our customers have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe provide service to a number of customers, including governmental entities and municipalities, some of which have suffered significant financial difficulties in recent years. Some of these entities could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at previous or increased rates. The inability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner or to pay increased prices, particularly large national accounts, could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe loss of our senior executives could affect our ability to manage our business profitably.\nWe depend on a small number of senior executives. Our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and keeping the executives and other employees that we need. We do not have written employment agreements with any of our executive officers, and officers and other key employees could leave us with little or no prior notice, either individually or as part of a group. Our loss of, or inability to hire, key employees could impair our ability to manage our business and direct its growth.\n2017 10-K Annual Report\nStericycle, Inc. \u2022 27\nPART I", "PERMNO": 83906, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "SRCL"}
