{"cik": "868278", "company": "ProPhase Labs, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ from our expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this Annual Report and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses.\nWe have experienced net losses from continuing operations before income tax for our last two fiscal years. As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $9.6 million, which we believe is an acceptable and adequate level of working capital to support our business for at least the next twelve months ending March 2022. Following the sale of our Cold-EEZE\u2122 business in March 2017, we have been actively exploring new product technologies, applications, product line extensions and other new product opportunities. In October 2020, we purchased our first CLIA licensed laboratory in Old Bridge, New Jersey, where we offer a variety of important medical tests, including, among others, COVID-19 diagnostic testing and Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) Molecular tests. In December 2020, we expanded our diagnostic services to a second location in Garden City, New York. We may in the future consider and pursue investments and acquisitions in other sectors and industries. There can be no assurance that our diagnostic services business will succeed or that we will be successful in initiating or acquiring any new lines of business in the future, or that any such new lines of business will achieve profitability.\nThe loss of sales to any one or more of our large third-party contract manufacturing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nFor each of Fiscal 2020 and 2019, our revenues from continuing operations came principally from our contract manufacturing services. Two third-party contract manufacturing customers, accounted for 47.1% and 17.2%, respectively of Fiscal 2020 revenues. Three third-party contract manufacturing customers, accounted for 36.5%, 30.5% and 11.1%, respectively, of Fiscal 2019 revenues. The loss of sales to any one or more of these third-party contract manufacturing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition, unless we are able to increase revenue from other sources.\nWe have a limited operating history in the diagnostic testing services business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offer, perform or generate revenues from our lab diagnostic services.\nDespite our management\u2019s extensive experience in the healthcare industry, we had no specific experience operating a diagnostic services business prior to entering this field in November 2020. We face substantial risks and uncertainties to which our diagnostic services business is subject. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must, among other things, successfully execute our business strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract and retain qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will operate profitably or that our business strategy will be successful. As a result, our diagnostic services business may not succeed.\nOur ability to generate revenues from COVID-19 and other RPP molecular testing, and our ability to generate profits from our diagnostic services business, will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf the level of demand for COVID-19 and other diagnostic testing, the price we are able to receive for performing our testing services, and the length of time for which that demand persists;\n\u25cf the availability of COVID-19 testing from other laboratories;\n\u25cf the period of time for which we are able to serve as an authorized laboratory offering COVID-19 testing under various Emergency Use Authorizations;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain our status as an authorized laboratory to perform COVID-19 and other diagnostic testing and related services and to respond to any changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the potential for supply disruptions and our reliance on certain single-source suppliers;\n\u25cf the potential for disruption in the delivery of patient samples to our laboratory;\n\u25cf the capacity of our laboratory to satisfy both COVID-19 testing and other testing demands;\n\u25cf the extent to which we choose to allocate limited laboratory capacity, supplies and other resources to areas of our business other than COVID-19 testing;\n\u25cf the complexity of billing for, and collecting revenue for, our testing services;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain laboratory operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and to perform the test accurately and punctually;\n\u25cf our ability to expand and or diversity our diagnostic services and\n\u25cf the ease of use of our ordering and reporting process.\nIn addition, the process of building and expanding our lab diagnostic service business may divert resources and distract management\u2019s attention from other areas of our business that may be more profitable or strategic. If we are unable to successfully provide diagnostic services while continuing to operate our existing manufacturing and dietary supplements business, our results of operations, financial position and reputation may suffer.\nIf demand for COVID-19 testing decreases or becomes no longer necessary and we are unable to generate sufficient profits from other RPP Molecular tests, our business could be materially harmed and our $3.0 million Secured Promissory Note receivable could become uncollectable.\nThere can be no assurance that demand for our COVID-19 testing services will continue to exist in the future due to successful containment efforts, the successful vaccination of a majority of Americans, or due to other events. If there is no demand for our COVID-19 testing services, and we are unable to generate sufficient profits from other RPP Molecular tests, our business could be materially harmed. Similarly, the business of the issuer of our $3.0 million secured note (\u201cSecured Note\u201d), who is also in the diagnostic test processing business, could also be harmed, leading to their inability to repay amounts due and owed to us under the Secured Note. If the issuer is unable to pay amounts owed to us under the Secured Note receivable, we may be required to pursue legal remedies in order to recoup amounts owed to us.\nWe may require additional capital to support our growing diagnostic services business and product development and commercialization programs and additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to support our growing diagnostic services business and consumer product development and commercialization programs. The amount of capital that may be needed to support our business will depend on many factors which may include, but are not limited to (i) the revenue we generate from our lab diagnostic services, contract manufacturing services and dietary supplement sales, (ii) the expenses we incur in growing our lab diagnostic business and marketing our manufacturing capabilities and dietary supplement line; (iii) the cost involved in applying for and obtaining FDA, international regulatory or other technical approvals, if required, and (iv) whether we elect to establish partnering or other strategic arrangements for the development, sales, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\nIncome from our diagnostic services business, contract manufacturing business and TK Supplements\u00ae products line may not generate all the funds we need to support the growth of our diagnostic services business and future product development and commercialization. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may, in the short and long-term, seek to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities or through other financing sources. To the extent that we seek to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may include financial and other covenants that could restrict our use of the proceeds from such financing or impose other business and financial restrictions on us. In addition, we may consider alternative approaches such as licensing, joint venture, or partnership arrangements to provide long term capital. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe customers for whom we contract manufacture may significantly influence our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contract manufacturing business is dependent on demand for the products we manufacture for our customers and we have no control or influence over the market demand for those products. Demand for our customers\u2019 products may be adversely affected by, among other things, regulatory issues, the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, the emergence of competing products, competition from other contract manufacturers, negative public or consumer perception of those products or our industry and changes in the marketing strategies for such products. If production volumes of products that we manufacture for third-parties and related revenues are not maintained or if there is any change in the terms or termination of our manufacturing agreement with Mylan or any of our other significant customers, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to our supply chain or increases in the price or adulteration of key raw materials needed for our businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to our supply chain, including our access to raw materials necessary for our contract manufacturing business and TK Supplements\u00ae product line as well as access to COVID-19 testing supplies and personal protective equipment for our diagnostic services business, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, third parties that are critical to our businesses, including vendors, suppliers, and business partners. While our businesses have not been impacted up to this point by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult if not impossible to predict, whether that may change in the future.\nOur TK Supplements\u00ae products and the products we manufacture for third parties are composed of certain key raw materials. If the prices of these raw materials were to increase significantly, it could result in a significant increase to us in the prices charged to us for our own branded products and third-party products. Raw material prices may increase in the future and we may not be able to pass on those increases to customers who purchase our products or to the customers whose products we manufacture. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are reliant upon the supply of raw materials that meet our specifications and the specifications of third parties for whom we manufacture. If any raw material is adulterated and does not meet our specifications or third parties\u2019 specifications, it could significantly impact our ability to manufacture products and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we are no longer able to obtain the resources, raw materials or components we need from one or more of our suppliers on terms reasonable to us or at all, including as a result of the increased demand that may be placed on our suppliers as a result of public health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer relationships could be materially and adversely affected, which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions at our PMI manufacturing facilities or any loss of manufacturing certifications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and customer relationships.\nAny significant disruption at our manufacturing facility for any reason, including regulatory requirements, an FDA determination that the facility is not in compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations, the loss of certifications, power interruptions, destruction or damage to the facility or disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our ability to manufacture products for our contract manufacturing customers and any of our own branded products. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur PMI manufacturing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and may fluctuate from cold season to cold season.\nBecause the majority of sales from our PMI manufacturing facility are from cold remedy products, our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuations and influenced by the timing, length and severity of each cold season. Our revenues tend to be higher in the first, third and fourth quarters during the cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period of September to March, when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors.\nOur product development and commercialization efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThere are numerous risks associated with OTC product development and commercialization. We may be subject to delays and/or be unable to successfully implement our business plan and strategy to develop and commercialize one or more OTC products and/or dietary supplements. The successful commercialization and market acceptance of any products we develop will be subject to, among other things, consumer purchasing trends, health and wellness trends, regulatory factors, retail acceptance and overall economic and market conditions. As a consequence, we may suspend or abandon some or all of our proposed new products before they ever become commercially viable. Even if we successfully develop and obtain approval of a new product, if we cannot successfully commercialize it in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to significant competitive pressures.\nWe compete with other contract manufacturers of OTC drug and dietary supplement products. These suppliers range widely in size. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. Management believes that our manufacturing capacity and abilities offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the full service contract development and manufacturing industry. We have over 20 years of manufacturing experience and industry know how in large scale batch production of OTC lozenge products. To the extent that any of our competitors are able to offer better prices, quality and/or services, however, we could lose customers and our sales and margins may decline.\nThe OTC healthcare products and dietary supplements industries are highly competitive. Many of the participants in these industries have substantially greater capital resources, technical staffs, facilities, marketing resources, product development, and distribution experience than we do. We believe that our ability to continue to compete in these industries will depend on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support. However, our failure to appropriately and timely respond to consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of products we develop and commercialize could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur principal competition for our lab diagnostic services are commercial laboratories, such as Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, both all of which have significant infrastructures and resources to support their diagnostic processing services. In addition, we compete with large, multispecialty group medical clinics, health systems and academic medical university-based clinics may provide in-house clinical laboratories offering COVID-19 and other RPP Molecular tests. Additionally, we compete against regional clinical laboratories providing diagnostic testing, including Interpace Biosciences, Inc. If we are unable to compete effectively, our earnings may be significantly negatively impacted.\nOur success is dependent on key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continued service of key personnel, such as Mr. Ted Karkus, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain managers and strategists within the Company. The loss of the services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn order to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, marketing and health product positions. In particular, our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified health and science professionals. Competition for skilled employees who can perform the services that we require is intense and hiring, training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills required is time-consuming and expensive. If we are not able to hire sufficient professional staff to support our operations, or to train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we do hire, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results.\nFailure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could impact our business.\nWe will rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights in any products we develop and commercialize. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. From time to time, we may apply to have certain trademarks registered. There is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cSection 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (the \u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.\nBased on our Section 382 analysis, we do not believe our current net operating loss carryforwards are subject to these limitations as of December 31, 2020.\nAdverse credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact the availability and cost of credit to us in the future. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash. Overall, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets.\nSystem failures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many companies, our business is highly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently our operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurate tracking of purchases and volume incentives and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrence of a natural disaster, security breach or other unanticipated problem could result in interruptions in our day-to-day operations that could adversely affect our business. A long-term failure or impairment of any of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Litigation\nOur contract manufacturing and dietary supplement businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that cover:\n\u25cf the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products;\n\u25cf the health and safety of our products;\n\u25cf trade practice and direct selling laws; and\n\u25cf product claims and advertising.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is time consuming and expensive. Moreover, new regulations could be adopted that would severely restrict the products we sell or manufacture or our ability to continue our business. We are unable to predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These future changes could, however, require the reformulation or elimination of certain products; imposition of additional record keeping and documentation requirements; imposition of new federal reporting and application requirements; modified methods of importing, manufacturing, storing or distributing certain products; and expanded or different labeling and substantiation requirements for certain products and ingredients. Any or all of these requirements could harm our business.\nIn July 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients (\u201cNDIs\u201d) and in August 2016, the FDA issued revised draft guidance. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA\u2019s current views, including its position on enforcement. We believe that the draft guidance, if implemented as proposed, could have a material impact on our operations. FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively affect our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that those ingredients or products are in compliance, and the potential imposition of penalties for non-compliance.\nOur diagnostic business could be harmed by the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), or those of Medicare, Medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the United States.\nThe performance of laboratory testing is subject to extensive U.S. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all physician practices performing clinical laboratory testing and to clinical laboratories operating in the United States by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or, in the case of clinical laboratories, by a federally approved accreditation agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. In addition, we expect to be subject to regulation under state law. State laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of diagnostic products could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, including COVID-19 diagnostics authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products.\nFDA regulation of the diagnostic products we use could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe expect our diagnostic testing operations to be subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among other things:\n\u25cf CLIA, which requires that laboratories obtain certification from the federal government, and state licensure laws;\n\u25cf CMS and FDA laws and regulations;\n\u25cf HIPAA, which imposes comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments to HIPAA under HITECH, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u25cf state laws regulating genetic testing and protecting the privacy of genetic test results, as well as state laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data and mandating reporting of breaches to affected individuals and state regulators;\n\u25cf the federal anti-kickback law, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program;\n\u25cf other federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufactures to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf Section 216 of the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires applicable laboratories to report private payor data in a timely and accurate manner beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (and in some cases annually);\n\u25cf state laws that impose reporting and other compliance-related requirements;\n\u25cf state billing laws, including regulations on \u201cpass through billing\u201d which may limit our ability to submit claims for payment and/or mark up the cost of services in excess of the price paid for such services, and \u201cdirect-bill\u201d laws which may limit our ability to purchase services from a laboratory and bill for the services ordered;\n\u25cf similar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. Our failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in state and federal health care programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our laboratory\u2019s ability to provide or receive payment for our services. Any action taken against us by a governmental entity or private party could, regardless of their outcome, damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations, and other private third-party payors.\nWe use potentially hazardous materials, chemicals and patient samples in our business and any disputes relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur lab diagnostic services involves the controlled use of hazardous laboratory materials and chemicals, including small quantities of acid and alcohol, and patient samples. We are subject to U.S. laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste. We could be liable for accidental contamination or discharge or any resultant injury from hazardous materials, and conveyance, processing, and storage of and data on patient samples. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources. Further, future changes to environmental health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict operations.\nIn the event of a lawsuit or investigation concerning such hazardous materials, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous materials or patient samples that may contain infectious materials. The cost of this liability could exceed our resources. While we expect to maintain broad form liability insurance coverage for these risks, the level or breadth of our coverage may not be adequate to fully cover potential liability claims.\nFailure to accurately bill for testing services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government health care programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBilling for diagnostic testing services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, government groups, Medicare and Medicaid. We expect that the majority of our billing and related operations will be provided by a third party. Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government health care programs may result in various consequences, including the return of overpayments, civil and criminal fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in government health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed. The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against health care companies on behalf of the government.\nAlthough we expect to be in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which services will be reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We expect that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived health care fraud. Legislative provisions relating to health care fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.\nOur failure to comply with FTC regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against OTC drug companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nLaws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell our products in some markets or require us to make changes to our business model in some markets.\nDirect selling companies are subject to laws and regulations by various government agencies. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices and to protect consumers. The FTC periodically investigates and brings enforcement actions against direct selling companies based on alleged pyramid selling activity and/or false and misleading claims made by the direct selling company or its independent distributors. Direct selling companies that have been the subject of an FTC enforcement action have generally been required to make significant changes to their business model and pay significant monetary fines. Being the target of an investigation or enforcement action by the FTC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services critical to our diagnostic testing business, and we depend on them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, any breaches of the information technology systems of third parties could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services critical to our diagnostic testing business, including diagnostic lab equipment, supplies, ground and air transport of clinical and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people, among other services. Third parties that provide services to us are subject to similar risks related to security of customer-related information and compliance with U.S., state, local, or international environmental, health and safety, and privacy and security laws and regulations as we are. Any failure by third parties to comply with applicable laws, or any failure of third parties to provide services more generally, could have a material impact on us, whether because of the loss of the ability to receive services from the third parties, our legal liability for the actions or inactions of third parties, or otherwise. In addition, third parties to whom we outsource certain services or functions may process personal data, or other confidential information belonging to us. A breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm our business, results of operations and reputation.\nIf our products do not have the effects intended or cause undesirable side effects, our business may suffer.\nAlthough many of the ingredients in our current dietary supplement products are vitamins, minerals, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption, they also contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. While we believe that all of these products and the combinations of ingredients in them are safe when taken as directed, the products could have certain undesirable side effects if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer who has certain medical conditions. In addition, these products may not have the effect intended if they are not taken in accordance with certain instructions, which include certain dietary restrictions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of the products, even when used as directed, will have the effects intended or will not have harmful side effects in an unforeseen way or on an unforeseen cohort. If any of our products or products we develop or commercialize in the future are shown to be harmful or generate negative publicity from perceived harmful effects, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed significantly.\nWe must comply with complex and overlapping laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data.\nThere are a number of state, federal and international laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data. Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, HHS has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of PHI used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities.\nThe privacy regulations regulate the use and disclosure of PHI by health care providers engaging in certain electronic transactions or \u201cstandard transactions.\u201d They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA security regulations establish administrative, physical, and technical standards for maintaining the integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. These standards apply to covered health care providers and also to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d or third parties providing services involving the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI. As a result, we may be required to comply with both HIPAA privacy regulations and varying state privacy and security laws.\nMoreover, HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, a covered entity must notify each individual whose PHI is breached, federal regulators and in some cases, must publicize the breach in local or national media. Breaches affecting 500 individuals or more are publicized by federal regulators who publicly identify the breaching entity, the circumstances of the breach and the number of individuals affected.\nThese laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI. Given the complexity of HIPAA and HITECH and their overlap with state privacy and security laws, and the fact that these laws are rapidly evolving and are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. Adding to the complexity is that our planned operations are currently evolving and the requirements of these laws will apply differently depending on such things as whether or not we bill electronically for our services, or provide services involving the use or disclosure of PHI and incur compliance obligations as a business associate. The costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. Noncompliance could subject us to criminal penalties, civil sanctions and significant monetary penalties as well as reputational damage.\nWe are also required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees as well as receive and transfer certain payment information, to accept payments from our customers, including credit card information. Most states have adopted laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory contractual terms to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the United States implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements, and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. The collection and use of such information may be subject to contractual obligations as well. If the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third-party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws, regulations, and contractual obligations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe must comply with all applicable privacy and data security laws in order to operate our business and may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance, to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Breaches of health information and/or personal data may be extremely expensive to remediate, may prompt federal or state investigation, fines, civil and/or criminal sanctions and significant reputational damage.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nAs a direct marketer and manufacturer of products designed for human consumption, we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products or the products that we manufacture for third parties are alleged to have resulted in injury or to include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. Our current products and the products that we currently manufacture for third parties are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States and could contain contaminated substances.\nWhile we currently maintain product liability insurance, a successful claim brought against us related to our branded products or products that we manufacture for third parties in excess of, or outside of, our existing insurance coverage, could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with customers, which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Governance Matters\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur, could affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock. Moreover, the perceived risk of this potential dilution could cause stockholders to attempt to sell their shares and investors to \u201cshort\u201d our stock, a practice in which an investor sells shares that he or she does not own at prevailing market prices, hoping to purchase shares later at a lower price to cover the sale. As each of these events would cause the number of shares of common stock being offered for sale to increase, our common stock\u2019s market price would likely further decline. All of these events could combine to make it very difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, products or stock performance, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, the unpredictability of our financial results likely reduces the certainty, and therefore reliability, of the forecasts by securities or industry analysts of our future financial results, adding to the potential volatility of our stock price.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors owns a substantial amount of our common stock.\nAs of March 31, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 29.3% of our common stock. As such, our Chief Executive Officer may exert significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. Consequently, he exercises substantial influence over major decisions including major corporate actions such as mergers and other business combinations transactions which could result in or prevent a change of control of the Company. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our Chief Executive Officer could be in conflict with the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, a stockholder\u2019s ability to influence us through voting their shares may be limited.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions that may be barriers to a takeover.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions which may deter, discourage, or make it difficult for another person or entity to gain control of the Company through a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or similar transaction or series of transactions. These provisions may deter a future tender offer or other takeover attempt which could include a premium over the market price of our common stock at the time. Such provisions could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors from liability.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any person who is or was made a party to, or is or was threatened to be made a party to, any pending, completed, or threatened action, suit or proceeding because he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the Company\u2019s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. These provisions permit us to advance expenses to an indemnified party in connection with defending any such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by the indemnified party to repay those amounts if it is later determined that the party is not entitled to indemnification. We entered into indemnity agreements with each member of our board of directors. These agreements provide, among other things, that we will indemnify each officer and director in the event they become a party or otherwise a participant in any action or proceeding on account of their service as a director or officer of the Company (or service for another corporation or entity in any capacity at the request of the Company) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The indemnification provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and discourage or deter stockholders from suing directors or officers for breaches of their duties to the Company, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company or its stockholders. In addition, to the extent that we expend funds to indemnify directors and officers, funds will be unavailable for operational purposes.", "PERMNO": 85205, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRPH"}
