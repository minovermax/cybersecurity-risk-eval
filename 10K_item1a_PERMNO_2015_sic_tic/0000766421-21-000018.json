{"cik": "766421", "company": "ALASKA AIR GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. The trading price of our common stock could also decline. We operate in a continually changing business environment. In this environment, new risks may emerge, and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence. Management cannot predict such developments, nor can it assess the impact, if any, on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forward-looking statements.\nWe have adopted an enterprise-wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight. These enterprise-wide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below.\nCOVID-19\nThe global pandemic caused by COVID-19, and related measures implemented to combat its spread has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations, financial position and liquidity.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus and its resulting disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China. Since that time, COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the globe, including within the United States, where millions of cases have been positively diagnosed to date. In March 2020, the President of the United States declared a national emergency in response to the rapid spread, and all markets we serve implemented some measure of travel restriction or stay-at-home order. These orders, combined with a wariness among the public of travel by aircraft due to perceived risk of infection, resulted in an unprecedented decline in business and leisure travel. Cancellations of conventions and conferences, sporting events, concerts and other similar events, as well as the closure of popular tourist destinations, contributed to this decline. This reduction in demand had a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations. As there is uncertainty of when these restrictions will be lifted or when demand may return, we expect to continue to see negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Our operations could be negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to COVID-19, or if they are subject to additional governmental COVID-19 stay-at-home health orders or similar\nrestrictions. Measures restricting the ability of our airport or inflight employees to come to work may cause further deterioration in our service or operations, all of which could negatively affect our business. Additionally, the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and the timing of inoculation in each state we serve will impact the willingness of the public to travel and our ability to recover from the impacts of the pandemic.\nIn response to the pandemic, we implemented, and continue to refine and adjust, a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impacts on our business. This strategy may itself have negative impacts on our business and operations. One such action is the elimination of change fees for first and main cabin fares and the ability to rebook travel for an extended period beyond standard rebooking terms. The loss of change fee revenue, combined with ongoing significant ticket cancellation activity, has adversely impacted our revenues and liquidity.\nWe have also implemented significant cash preservation and cost reduction strategies in response to the impacts of COVID-19. These strategies include, but are not limited to, capital expenditure reductions, solicitation of voluntary short- and long-term leaves of absence and renegotiation of contractual terms and conditions with vendors. These measures, while helpful in slowing the rate at which we utilize our cash, are not expected to fully offset the loss of cash as a result of decreased ticket sales. Further, should we not be able to recall and provide training to those accepting long-term leaves of absence to provide staffing to match our expectations of capacity, we may not be able to capitalize on the return of demand. This may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nAt this time, we are unable to predict what impact the pandemic will have on future customer behavior. Future business travel may be impacted by widespread use of video conferencing or the reduction of business travel budgets. Travelers may also be more reluctant in general to travel, and the Company may need to expend significant resources to educate and demonstrate that air travel does not pose a health risk. In addition, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur COVID-19 related costs for enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among employees and guests. Although these procedures are elective, the industry may be subject to mandated cleaning and safety measures in the future, which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement. Additionally, the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and the timing of inoculation in each state we serve will impact the willingness of the public to travel. These contingencies, individually and in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe have accepted certain conditions by accepting funding under the Payroll Support Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020, providing U.S. airlines and related businesses the ability to access liquidity in the form of grants, loans, loan guarantees and other investments by the U.S. government.\nIn 2020, the Company, Alaska, Horizon, and McGee entered agreements with the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to secure approximately $1.1 billion of funding under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program (PSP), of which $290 million is in the form of an unsecured senior term loan payable over ten years. On January 15, 2021, Alaska and Horizon finalized agreements with the Treasury and accepted partial disbursement of funds through an extended round of PSP funding, made available under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. PSP proceeds must be used exclusively for employee payroll and benefits expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PSP agreements and the applicable provisions of the CARES Act.\nAlso in 2020, the Company and its airline subsidiaries entered agreements with the Treasury to obtain access to term loans of approximately $1.9 billion under the CARES Act loan program. Funds drawn under the loan program must be secured with assets owned by Alaska or Horizon.\nTo date, the Company has drawn $135 million from the loan facility, and may, at its option, borrow additional amounts in up to two subsequent borrowings until May 28, 2021. All proceeds must be used for general corporate purposes and operating expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreements and the applicable provisions of the CARES Act. All borrowings are pre-payable in whole or in part and are ultimately due and payable on September 26, 2025 (or March 28, 2025 with respect to the portion of the loan, if any, secured with certain loyalty program assets).\nIn addition to repayment commitments, we are subject to the following conditions under our CARES Act PSP and loan agreements:\n\u2022Alaska, Horizon and McGee have to refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits for non-officer employees through March 31, 2021;\n\u2022Alaska and Horizon may have to maintain DOT-prescribed levels of air service to markets they served as of March 1, 2020, through March 1, 2022;\n\u2022The Company may not repurchase its common stock or pay dividends on its common stock until the later of March 31, 2022, or one year after secured loan funds are repaid;\n\u2022The Company must meet minimum liquidity and collateral coverage ratio requirements until the secured loan funds are repaid;\n\u2022Compensation and severance payments for officers and employees who earned more than $425,000 in total compensation in 2019 will be subject to maximum limitations through the later of October 1, 2022, or one year after secured loan funds are repaid; and\n\u2022The Company must maintain certain internal controls and records, and provide any additional reporting required by the U.S. government, relating to PSP and loan funding.\nThese conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with loyalty partners, our attractiveness to investors, and our ability to compensate at market-competitive levels and retain key personnel.\nSAFETY, COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident.\nAn accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our Company by the flying public and/or aviation authorities. We could experience significant claims from injured passengers, bystanders and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service. We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers. However, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft, could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives. This would harm our business.\nWe announced plans to replace many of our Airbus aircraft with Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, and in January 2021 we took delivery of our first MAX aircraft, which is expected to enter revenue service in March 2021. Although the grounding of the aircraft was lifted in late 2020 following an extensive recertification process, there is potential the traveling public may not trust the aircraft for safe operation. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources in restoring guest confidence on the safe operation of the 737 MAX aircraft. Failure to address guest confidence may negatively harm our business, growth plans and results of operations.\nOur operations are often affected by factors beyond our control, including delays, cancellations and other conditions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs is the case for all airlines, our operations often are affected by delays, cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control.\nFactors that might impact our operations include:\n\u2022contagious illness and fear of contagion;\n\u2022congestion, construction, and/or space constraints at airports, specifically in our hub locations of Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco;\n\u2022air traffic control problems;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022lack of operational approval (e.g. new routes, aircraft deliveries, etc.);\n\u2022increased security measures or breaches in security;\n\u2022changes in international treaties concerning air rights;\n\u2022international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity; and\n\u2022other changes in business conditions.\nDue to the concentration of our flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers. A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the above-mentioned factors could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, that require substantial compliance costs. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the U.S. DOT, the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft, operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect further regulation of on-board health and hygiene matters.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal, state and local levels. These initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment, minimum wage requirements, mandatory paid sick or family leave, and health care mandates. These laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs. New initiatives with employer-funded costs, specifically those impacting Washington State, could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared to our competitors. In recent years, the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws, particularly in California. Application of these laws may result in operational disruption, increased litigation risk, and impact on negotiated labor agreements. Additionally, compliance with existing and future regulation around environmental laws, including those involving aircraft emissions and environmental investigation and remediation costs, could require significant expenditures or result in significant fines or penalties.\nAlmost all commercial service airports are owned and/or operated by units of local or state governments. Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost. Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security, updates to infrastructure and other. Additional laws, regulations, taxes, airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance. Any instances of non-compliance could result in additional fines and fees.\nThe airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs.\nTerrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the U.S. could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry, including us, and could:\n\u2022significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel;\n\u2022significantly increase security and insurance costs;\n\u2022make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive;\n\u2022increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices;\n\u2022increase costs from airport shutdowns, flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats; and\n\u2022result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA.\nThe occurrence of any of these events would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party vendors for certain critical activities, which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases.\nWe rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business, including airframe and engine maintenance, regional flying, ground handling, fueling, computer reservation system hosting, telecommunication systems, information technology infrastructure and services, and deicing, among others.\nEven though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels, our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks. In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates, or at all. If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately, we may experience increased costs, delays, maintenance issues, safety issues or negative public perception of our airline. Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms. These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure.\nSTRATEGY\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.S. airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition. In recent years, the market share held by low-cost carriers and ultra low-cost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase. Airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity, route systems, and the number of markets served. Several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve, particularly in our key West Coast markets. This dynamic may be exacerbated by actions from airlines as we compete to attract passengers during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit cost-reduction goals. This is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital. If we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the long-term and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital, we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns. Therefore, our financial results may suffer.\nThe airline industry may undergo further restructuring, consolidation, or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring, consolidation, and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures. Since deregulation, both the U.S. and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions. Carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances, slot swaps/acquisitions and/or joint ventures. Certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes, pool revenues and costs, and enjoy other mutual benefits, achieving many of the benefits of consolidation.\nOur concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations.\nOur strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the West Coast. This results in a high concentration of our business in key West Coast markets. A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle, Portland, and Bay Area hubs. In 2020, passengers to and from Seattle, Portland, and the Bay Area accounted for 84% of our total guests.\nWe believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft and ground facilities, as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions. As a result, we remain highly dependent on our key markets. Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for\nair transportation in our key markets. An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that, if sustained, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts.\nAlaska is dependent on Boeing and Airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts. Horizon is similarly dependent on De Havilland and Embraer. Additionally, each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type. As a result, we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA. Should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers, it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods. Additionally, if COVID-19 causes our limited vendors to have performance problems, reduced or ceased operations, bankruptcies, or other events causing them to be unable to fulfill their commitments to us, our operations and business could be materially adversely affected.\nShould these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft, we may not be able to grow our fleet at our intended rate, which could impact our financial position. Following the recertification of the 737 MAX aircraft, Boeing has a significant production backlog which may impact the timing of deliveries. We have 32 737-9 MAX aircraft on order, with 13 aircraft deliveries currently anticipated in 2021. If we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner, our growth plans could be significantly impacted. Additionally, further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers. This could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured.\nWe rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements.\nOur airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers, or \u201cpartners,\" including the West Coast International Alliance (WCIA) with American, which was announced in 2020. These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner \u201ccodeshare\u201d flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights. In addition, the agreements generally provide that members of Alaska\u2019s Mileage Plan\u2122 program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa. We receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements. In addition, we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our loyalty program. The loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy, consolidation, or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan\u2122 program, which we believe is a source of competitive advantage.\nWe routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position, including alliances, codeshare arrangements, interline arrangements, and frequent flyer program enhancements, and will continue to have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities. If other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization, those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships.\nOur impending entry into the oneworld global alliance is expected to provide us with many benefits, including the ability to seamlessly connect our guests to more points around the globe, as well as better serve corporate partners. Entry into the alliance may cause us to lose existing codeshare agreements with partners who are not oneworld members, and could limit options to bring non-oneworld carrier partners into our Mileage PlanTM program. Further, maintaining the WCIA with another U.S. airline may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny. Failure to appropriately manage these partnerships and alliances could negatively impact future growth plans and our financial position.\nEconomic uncertainty, or another recession, would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe airline industry, which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand, is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. We are also highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health of the U.S. economy. Unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel. For some consumers, leisure travel is a discretionary expense, and shorter distance travelers, in particular, have the option to replace air travel with surface travel. Businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as video conferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs, which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat. Unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel, labor and other costs. Unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nWe rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business, and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business.\nWe depend on automated systems to operate our business, including our airline reservation system, our telecommunication systems, our website, our maintenance systems, our check-in kiosks, mobile devices, and other systems. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets, and the majority of our guests check-in using our website, airport kiosks, or our mobile application. We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. In order for our operations to work efficiently, we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website, reservation system and check-in systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain information security and deliver important flight information. Substantial or repeated website, reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline. In addition, we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling, flight dispatch and other operational needs. Disruptions, failed migration, untimely recovery, or a breach of these systems or our data center could result in the loss of important data, an increase of our expenses, an impact on our operational performance, or a possible temporary cessation of our operations.\nFailure to appropriately comply with information security rules and regulations or safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost.\nWe accept, store and transmit information about our guests, our employees, our business partners, and our business. Many international and U.S. jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing their own data security and privacy regulatory framework with which we, our business partners, and our corporate customers must comply. There are also various bills pending at the U.S. state and federal levels that could impose additional privacy and data security obligations. This uncertain and increasingly complex regulatory environment may result in significant expenses associated with increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of personal information. If our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, decreased sales, or be exposed to fraud, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and operations. In addition, we frequently rely on third-party hosting sites and data processors, including cloud providers. To the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional litigation, regulatory risks and reputational harm.\nCyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business. Failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations, onboard safety, reputation and financial condition.\nOur sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks. Our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks. Unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information, including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception. Methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify. Because of these ever-evolving risks and regular attacks, we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices. However, the nature of these attacks means that proper policies and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access. A compromise of our systems, the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation. A cybersecurity attack impacting our onboard or other operational systems may result in an accident or incident onboard or significant operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, operation and financial position. Further, a significant portion of our office employees have transitioned to remote work, which could increase our potential exposure to cyberattacks, and could compromise our financial or operational systems.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business.\nFuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses. Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and fixed obligations, and have incurred substantial incremental debt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These obligations could lead to liquidity restraints and have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nWe carry, and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future, a substantial amount of debt and aircraft operating lease commitments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have incurred and may continue to seek new financing sources to fund our operations while demand remains at an unprecedented low level and for the unknown duration of any economic recovery period. Although we aim to keep our leverage low, due to our high fixed costs, including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings.\nOur outstanding long-term debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures, working capital or other purposes; require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Further, as we incur incremental obligations, issuers may require future debt agreements to contain more restrictive covenants or require additional collateral beyond historical market terms which may further restrict our ability to successfully access capital.\nAlthough we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due, we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future. If we fail to do so, our business could be harmed.\nOur maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages, and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the average age of our NextGen aircraft (B737-700, -800, -900, -900ERs) was approximately 9.9 years, the average age of our operating A320 and A321neo aircraft was approximately 7.2 years, the average age of our owned E175 aircraft was approximately 2.6 years, and the average age of our Q400 aircraft was approximately 12.7 years. Typically, our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future. Any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in unplanned maintenance expense as we are required to return leased planes in a contractually specified condition.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill, which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn accordance with acquisition accounting rules, we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the Virgin America acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of Virgin America\u2019s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually. We could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of, among other items, extreme fuel price volatility, a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets, unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows, uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties. We can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods. Any such charges may materially affect our financial results.\nBRAND AND REPUTATION\nAs we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets, we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests.\nWe continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers. These efforts could include significant enhancements to our in-airport and on-board environments, increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals (digital and mobile) and optimization of our customer loyalty programs. In pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base.\nThe Company's brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media.\nWe operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media. Negative publicity, including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees, or failure to adhere to COVID-19 related health and safety protocols, can spread rapidly through social media. Should the Company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity, the Company's brand and reputation may be significantly harmed. Such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nLABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGY\nA significant increase in labor costs, unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLabor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses. In addition to costs associated with represented employee groups, labor costs could also increase for non-unionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major U.S. airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market. Although ample efforts have been dedicated to right-sizing our management structure following the merger with Virgin America, these increased labor costs may adversely affect our financial performance.\nShould employees engage in job actions, such as slow-downs, sick-outs, or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during Section 6 negotiations, although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts, the operation could be significantly impacted. Although we have a long track record of fostering good communications, negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our long-term vision, unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert management\u2019s attention from other projects and issues, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract, retain and train qualified personnel, or maintain our culture, could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe compete against other major U.S. airlines for pilots, aircraft technicians and other skilled labor. As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age, the U.S. airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage. Attrition beyond normal levels, the inability to attract new pilots, or our key vendors' inability to attract and retain mechanics or other skilled labor positions could negatively impact our operating results. As a result, our business prospects could be harmed. Additionally, we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages, or pay increased rates to our vendors, to retain these positions. This would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our financial position.\nOur success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a unified culture with cohesive values and goals. Much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty. Failure to maintain and grow the Alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests, suppliers, employees and other constituencies. As part of this process, we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs.\nREGULATION\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to our company than to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 28804, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "ALK"}
