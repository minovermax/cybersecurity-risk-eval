You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDrilling wells is speculative, often involving significant costs that may be more than our estimates, and may not result in any discoveries or additions to our future production or reserves. Any material inaccuracies in estimated reserves, estimated drilling costs or underlying assumptions will materially affect our business.\nExploring for and developing oil and natural gas reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oilfield equipment and related services. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. Our initial drilling locations, and any potential additional locations that may be developed, require significant additional exploration and development, regulatory approval and commitments of resources prior to commercial development. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our business operations as proposed and would be forced to modify our plan of operation.\nOur estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and future production. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs in an exact way. Oil, natural gas and NGL reserve engineering is complex, requiring subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, future production levels and operating and development costs. In estimating our level of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, we and our independent reserve engineers make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, including assumptions relating to:\n\u2022 the level of oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022 future production levels;\n\u2022 capital expenditures;\n\u2022 operating and development costs;\n\u2022 the effects of regulation;\n\u2022 the accuracy and reliability of the underlying engineering and geologic data; and\n\u2022 the availability of funds.\nIf these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our estimated reserves could change significantly. For example, with other factors held constant, if the commodity prices used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2014 had decreased by 10%, then the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves as of that date would have decreased by approximately $423 million, from approximately $1,781 million to approximately $1,358 million.\nOur standardized measure is calculated using unhedged oil, natural gas and NGL prices and is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Over time, we may make material\nchanges to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production.\nThe reserve estimates we make for wells or fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for wells or fields with lengthy production histories. A lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospects are in various stages of evaluation. There is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies, and the study of producing fields in the same area, will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present or, if present, whether oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present in commercially viable quantities. Moreover, the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nOur estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves will naturally decline over time, and we may be unable to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, production volumes, and cash flow depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. Our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves will naturally decline over time as they are produced. Our success depends on our ability to economically develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our own current and future production. If we are unable to do so, or if expected development is delayed, reduced or cancelled, the average decline rates will likely increase.\nDeveloping and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are costly and high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of developing, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomical if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce as much oil, natural gas and NGLs as we had estimated. In addition, our use of 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques to identify subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures and requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies. Furthermore, our development and production operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022 high costs, shortages or delivery delays of rigs, equipment, labor or other services;\n\u2022 composition of sour gas, including sulfur and mercaptan content;\n\u2022 unexpected operational events and conditions;\n\u2022 reductions in oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022 increases in severance taxes;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022 facility or equipment malfunctions and equipment failures or accidents, including acceleration of deterioration of our facilities and equipment due to the highly corrosive nature of sour gas;\n\u2022 title problems;\n\u2022 pipe or cement failures, casing collapses or other downhole failures;\n\u2022 compliance with ever-changing environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil, natural gas and NGL spills, salt water spills, pipeline ruptures, discharges of toxic gases or other releases of hazardous substances;\n\u2022 lost or damaged oilfield development and service tools;\n\u2022 unusual or unexpected geological formations and pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022 loss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022 fires, blowouts, surface craterings and explosions;\n\u2022 uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, NGL or well fluids;\n\u2022 loss of leases due to incorrect payment of royalties;\n\u2022 limited availability of financing at acceptable rates; and\n\u2022 other hazards, including those associated with sour gas such as an accidental discharge of hydrogen sulfide gas, that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.\nIf any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion operations. Hydraulic fracturing has recently become subject to increased public scrutiny and recent changes in federal and state law, as well as proposed legislative changes, could significantly restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of natural gas, may preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, such laws could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. If hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays, financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements, as well as potential increases in costs. Please read \"-Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays\" and \"Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation-Water and Other Water Discharges and Spills.\"\nAdditionally, hydraulic fracturing, drilling, transportation and processing of hydrocarbons bear an inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, contamination of soil, ground water, and surface water, as well as potential fines, penalties or damages associated with any of the foregoing consequences.\nOur acquisition, development and production operations require us to make substantial capital expenditures. Although we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget for 2015 using cash flow from operations and cash on hand, if our cash flow from operations turns out to be less than we currently expect and we are required, but are unable, to fund our remaining capital budget from other sources, such as borrowings under our credit facility and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, our failure to obtain the funds that we need could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry in which we operate is capital intensive and we must make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, ability to borrow and access to capital markets are subject to a number of variables, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;\n\u2022 the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce;\n\u2022 the prices at which we sell our production;\n\u2022 the results of our hedging strategy;\n\u2022 the costs of developing, producing, and transporting our oil, natural gas and NGL assets, including costs attributable to governmental regulation and taxation;\n\u2022 our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022 interest payments, debt service and dividend payment requirements;\n\u2022 prevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022 our financial condition; and\n\u2022 the ability and willingness of banks and other lenders to lend to us.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil, NGL or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have a reduced ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. In addition, we may be unable to access the capital markets for debt or equity financing. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the funds we need to fund our capital budget, we will be forced to reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could lead to a decline in our production, revenues and our reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket conditions for oil, natural gas and NGLs, and particularly the recent declines in prices for these commodities, could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.\nPrices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022 domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022 weather conditions and the occurrence of natural disasters;\n\u2022 overall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u2022 political and economic conditions in oil, natural gas and NGL producing countries globally, including terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war;\n\u2022 actions of OPEC and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022 the effect of increasing liquefied natural gas and exports from the United States;\n\u2022 the impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u2022 domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells, and taxation;\n\u2022 the impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022 the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022 the availability of refining capacity; and\n\u2022 the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nIn the past, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. Recently, oil prices have declined precipitously. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the West Texas Intermediate posted price used to calculate the full cost ceiling in accordance with SEC rules declined from a high of $105.34 per bo on July 1, 2014 to $69.00 per bo on December 1, 2014. Such volatility may affect the amount of our net estimated proved reserves and will affect the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our net estimated proved reserves. We recorded a full cost ceiling test impairment before income taxes of $213.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The combined impact of lower commodity prices adversely affecting proved reserve values and the historical costs to drill and complete wells carried as proved undeveloped, as compared to current drilling and completion costs primarily contributed to the ceiling impairment. Changes in production rates, levels of reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties, and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analyses in future periods. Given the current trend in commodity prices, the Company expects a continued decline in 12-month average commodity prices and therefore, we expect additional impairments could be recorded during 2015.\nIn addition, our revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, and a sustained drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, sustained declines in commodity prices will:\n\u2022 limit our ability to enter into commodity derivative contracts at attractive prices;\n\u2022 reduce the value and quantities of our reserves, because declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices would reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce;\n\u2022 reduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures;\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and\n\u2022 make it uneconomical for our operating partners to commence or continue production levels of oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nAn increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production sometimes reflect differences between the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating\nhedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a basis differential. Increases in the basis differential between the benchmark prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have or currently plan to have any commodity derivative contracts covering the amount of the basis differentials we experience in respect of our production. As such, we will be exposed to any increase in such differentials, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of February 26, 2015, we have commodity derivative contracts in place covering approximately 60% of the mid-point of our estimated oil and natural gas production for 2015. The contracts consist of swaps, enhanced swaps, collars, put spreads, and three-way costless collars, covering crude oil and natural gas production. In the future, we expect to continue to enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our estimated production, which could result in net gains or losses on commodity derivatives. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined by our management, which is not under any obligation to enter into commodity derivative contracts covering any specific portion of our production.\nThe prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our production in the future will be dependent upon oil, natural gas and NGL prices at the time we enter into these transactions, which may be substantially higher or lower than past or current oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Accordingly, our price hedging strategy may not protect us from significant declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices realized for our future production. Conversely, our hedging strategy may limit our ability to realize incremental cash flows from commodity price increases. As such, our hedging strategy may not protect us from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices that could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic uncertainty could negatively impact the prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, limit access to the credit and equity markets, increase the cost of capital, and may have other negative consequences that we cannot predict.\nIf our cash flow from operations is less than anticipated and our access to capital is restricted because of economic uncertainty, we may be required to reduce our operating and capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and future operations. Ongoing uncertainty may also reduce the values we are able to realize in asset sales or other transactions we may engage in to raise capital, thus making these transactions more difficult and less economic to consummate. Additionally, demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs may deteriorate and result in lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have a negative impact on our revenues. Lower prices could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations.\nLower oil, natural gas and NGL prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation impairments, which would reduce our earnings and stockholders' equity.\nWe use the full-cost method of accounting and accordingly, we capitalize all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil, natural gas and NGL properties, including unproved and unevaluated property costs. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of oil, natural gas and NGL properties may not exceed a \"ceiling limit\" that is based upon the present value of estimated future net revenues from net proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of the cost or fair market value of unproved properties and other adjustments as required by SEC rules. If net capitalized costs of oil, natural gas and NGL properties exceed the ceiling limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. This is called a \"ceiling limitation impairment.\" The risk that we will experience a ceiling limitation impairment increases when oil,\nnatural gas or NGL prices are depressed, if we have substantial downward revisions in estimated net proved reserves or if estimates of future development costs increase significantly. Based upon current price trends we could experience ceiling limitation impairments in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties exceeded our ceiling amount using the WTI unweighted 12-month average price of $94.99/bo for oil, the Mt. Belvieu unweighted 12-month average price of $44.84/bbl for NGLs and the Henry Hub unweighted 12-month average price of $4.35/mmbtu for natural gas adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price realized at the wellhead, resulting in a write-down of our oil and natural gas properties of $213.8 million before income taxes. As ceiling test computations depend upon the calculated unweighted arithmetic average prices, it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing and magnitude of any future impairments. However, given the current trend in commodity prices, the Company expects a continued decline in 12-month average commodity prices, and, therefore, we expect additional impairments could be recorded during 2015. A ceiling test write down would negatively affect our results of operations.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are not initially subject to the ceiling test limitation. Rather, we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value based upon our intentions with respect to drilling on such properties, the remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results, the assignment of proved reserves, and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. These factors are significantly influenced by our expectations regarding future commodity prices, development costs, and access to capital at acceptable cost. During any period in which these factors indicate impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization and the ceiling test limitation. Accordingly, a significant change in these factors, many of which are beyond our control, may shift a significant amount of cost from unevaluated properties into the full cost pool that is subject to amortization and the ceiling test limitation.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial and sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices would render uneconomic a significant portion of our development and exploitation projects. This may result in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, substantial and sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nThe Company's derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses.\nTo mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities, support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects, the Company's strategy is to enter into derivative arrangements covering a portion of its oil, NGL and natural gas production. These derivative arrangements are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company's statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant non-cash gains or losses. These derivative contracts may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:\n\u2022 production is less than the contracted derivative volumes, in which case we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our hedging obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity;\n\u2022 the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022 there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge instrument; or\n\u2022 the derivative contracts limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.\nSuch financial losses could materially impact our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been volatile. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2014, our stock price had a high closing price of $38.13 per share and a low closing price of $6.48 per share. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the price of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 the success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil we produce;\n\u2022 regulatory developments in the United States;\n\u2022 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 quarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 market conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or changed securities;\n\u2022 analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u2022 the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022 the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022 our issuance of any additional securities;\n\u2022 investor perception of our company and of the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022 general economic, political and market conditions.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production in paying quantities is established during their primary terms or we obtain extensions of the leases. Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if our undeveloped leasehold acreage will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage. As of December 31, 2014, we had leases representing 33,173 net acres (32,961 of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2015, 16,594 net acres (11,222 of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale)\nexpiring in 2016, and 54,469 net acres (13,342 of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2017 and beyond. While we anticipate that our current and future drilling plans will address the majority of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2015, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. See \"Business and Properties-Properties-Developed and Undeveloped Acreage\" for additional information.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil, NGL and natural gas prices, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, NGL or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive with respect to acquiring prospects and properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas, and securing equipment and trained personnel. Many of our competitors are large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than those of the Sanchez Group. Those entities may be able to develop and acquire more properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial, technical or personnel resources permit. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry. These larger companies may have a greater ability to continue development activities during periods of low oil, NGL and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Furthermore, we may not be able to aggregate sufficient quantities of production to compete with larger companies that are able to sell greater volumes of production to intermediaries, thereby reducing the realized prices attributable to our production. Any inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are a variety of operating risks inherent in our wells and other operating properties and facilities, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and natural disasters, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of our wells and other operating properties and facilities near populated areas, including\nresidential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.\nInsurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms. Changes in the insurance markets due to weather, adverse economic conditions, and the aftermath of the Macondo well incident in the Gulf of Mexico have made it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes, and we cannot be sure the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major contiguous area.\nOur current business focus is on the oil and natural gas industry in a limited number of properties, in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and, to a lesser extent, the TMS in Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana. Larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we currently lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of our business. For example, our Catarina assets, comprised of approximately 106,000 contiguous net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas under the Catarina Lease, represent approximately 52% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014, approximately 47% of our Eagle Ford acreage as of December 31, 2014 and, on a pro forma basis, approximately 53% of our total production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, increasing our risk profile. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we own an ownership interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues and reserves. The success and\ntiming of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022 the nature and timing of the operator's drilling and other activities;\n\u2022 the timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\n\u2022 the operator's geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022 the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022 the operator's selection of suitable technology.\nOur ability to produce oil and natural gas could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.\nOur inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The Clean Water Act and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System general permits issued by the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Indeed, on October 20, 2011, the EPA announced its intention to develop federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the new pretreatment rules will require coalbed methane and shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities. Proposed rules are expected in early 2015. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nWe may lose our rights to the Sanchez Group's technological database, including its 3D and 2D seismic data, under certain circumstances.\nPursuant to the Services Agreement, we have access to the unrestricted, proprietary portions of the technological database owned and maintained by the Sanchez Group and related to our properties, and SOG is otherwise required to interpret and use the database, to the extent relating to our properties, for our benefit under the Services Agreement. For a description of the Services Agreement see Note 9, \"Related Party Transactions\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This database includes the 2D and 3D seismic data used for our exploration and development projects as well as the well logs, LAS files, scanned well documents and other well documents and software that are necessary for our daily operations. This information is critical for the operation and expansion of our business. Under certain circumstances, including if SOG provides at least 180 days' advance written notice of its desire\nto terminate the Services Agreement, the license agreement will terminate and we will lose our rights to this technological database unless members of the Sanchez Group permit us to retain some or all of these rights, which they may decline to do in their sole discretion. In such event, we are unlikely to be able to obtain rights to similar information under substantially similar commercial terms or to continue our business operations as proposed and our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and it could delay or prevent an acquisition of us.\nOur use of 2D and 3D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable geoscientists to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures or the amount of hydrocarbons. We employ 3D seismic technology with respect to certain of our projects. The implementation and practical use of 3D seismic technology is relatively new, unproven and unconventional, which can lessen its effectiveness, at least in the near term, and increase our costs. In addition, the use of 3D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur greater drilling and exploration expenses as a result of such expenditures, which may result in a reduction in our returns. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline.\nWe often gather 3D seismic data over large areas. Our interpretation of seismic data delineates those portions of an area that we believe are desirable for drilling. Therefore, we may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data, and in many cases, we may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location. If we are not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms, we will have made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze 3D data without having an opportunity to attempt to benefit from those expenditures.\nIf we do not purchase additional acreage or make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:\n\u2022 unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with their owners;\n\u2022 unable to obtain financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or\n\u2022 outbid by competitors.\nIf we are unable to acquire properties containing estimated proved reserves, our total level of estimated proved reserves will decline as a result of our production.\nAny acquisitions we complete or geographic expansions we undertake will be subject to substantial risks that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022 mistaken assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies, timing of expected development and the potential for expiration of underlying leaseholds;\n\u2022 an inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022 a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022 a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022 the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;\n\u2022 the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 mistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;\n\u2022 an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;\n\u2022 facts and circumstances that could give rise to significant cash and certain non-cash charges; and\n\u2022 customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nFurther, we may in the future expand our operations into new geographic areas with operating conditions and a regulatory environment that may not be as familiar to us as our existing project areas. As a result, we may encounter obstacles that may cause us not to achieve the expected results of any such acquisitions, and any adverse conditions, regulations or developments related to any assets acquired in new geographic areas may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition, given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nOur completed acquisitions involve risks associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired assets, including the potential exposure to significant liabilities, and the intended benefits of these acquisitions may not be realized.\nWe have grown our business and our reserves through multiple significant acquisitions. Each of these acquisitions involves certain risks. The risks that we face associated with our acquisitions and integrating the assets acquired from these acquisitions into existing operations include:\n\u2022 our senior management's attention being diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the acquired assets;\n\u2022 our incurring significant unknown and contingent liabilities for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage;\n\u2022 the acquired assets not performing as well as we anticipate; and\n\u2022 unexpected costs, delays and challenges that arise in integrating such assets into our existing operations.\nEven if we successfully integrate the assets acquired in our acquisitions into our operations, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits that we anticipate and/or we may not realize these benefits within the expected timeframe. If we fail to realize the benefits that we anticipate from our acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the lease with respect to the Catarina assets, we are subject to annual drilling and development requirements and failure to comply with these requirements may result in loss of our interests in the Catarina area that are not held by production.\nIn order to protect our exploration and development rights in the Catarina area, we are required to meet certain drilling and other requirements under the lease with respect to this area (the \"Catarina Lease\"). For example, the Catarina Lease currently requires us to drill 50 wells per year (measured from July to July). If we fail to meet the minimum drilling commitment under the terms of the Catarina Lease, we would forfeit our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, associated rights such as midstream assets). In addition, the Catarina Lease requires us to go no longer than 120 days without spudding a well, and, under the terms of the Catarina Lease, failure to do so would result in the forfeiture of our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, acreage upon which associated midstream assets are located). Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that we will be able meet our obligations under the Catarina Lease. If the Catarina Lease expires, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating losses (\"NOLs\") carryforwards of $645.1 million. If we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \"5% shareholders\" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions in order to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future sources of capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to permit us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital.\nWe cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds that may be realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. Our credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes (as defined in Note 5, \"Long-Term Debt\") contain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets and our use of any of the proceeds. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022 our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022 the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022 we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had $1.75 billion of debt outstanding, all of which was attributable to our Senior Notes, and a borrowing base of $650 million (with an elected commitment amount of $300 million) under our credit facility for secured revolver borrowings. Our increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business. In particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our credit facility, which bears interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes will not affect the market value of any debt incurred under such facility, but could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We currently do not have any interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to our credit facilities, nor are any contemplated in the future. A significant increase in prevailing interest rates that results in a substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness could substantially increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.\nOur credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022 issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022 pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022 make loans and investments;\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate or merge with or into another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 enter into new lines of business.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or under our credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in an acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under our credit facility would permit the lenders under the facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nThe aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including the following:\n\u2022 any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022 the covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022 we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022 we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022 our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves on the unweighted\narithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil, natural gas and NGL properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022 the actual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022 our actual operating costs in producing oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of our capital expenditures;\n\u2022 the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; and\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from our estimated reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with ASC Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Natural Gas, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nWe have limited experience drilling wells on our TMS acreage, which has a short operational history and is subject to more uncertainties than our drilling program in more established formations.\nWe and other operators have begun drilling wells in the TMS only recently. Accordingly, there is limited information on which we can determine optimum drilling and completion strategies and drilling costs (which may be higher than other trends in which we operate), or estimate production decline rates or recoverable reserves from drilling on our acreage in this trend. Our drilling plans with respect to the TMS are flexible and depend on a number of factors, including the extent to which our initial wells in the trend are commercially successful.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. This process is typically regulated by state agencies. The EPA, however, has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the federal SDWA UIC Program. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published revised UIC Program guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how regulations of Class II wells, which are those wells injecting fluids associated with oil and natural gas production activities, may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas and Louisiana, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of the above-mentioned draft guidance. Also, the EPA is updating chloride water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life under the Clean Water Act, which criteria are used by states for establishing acceptable discharge limits. The EPA is expected to release draft criteria in early 2016. In addition, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic\nSubstances Control Act regarding the disclosure of information related to the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period ended on September 18, 2014.\nAt the same time, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, with a draft of the study anticipated to be available by March 2015, and legislation has been proposed before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which legislation could be reintroduced in the current session of Congress. Further, certain members of the Congress have called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency's estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates.\nThese ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, Texas recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that hydraulic fracturing well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of OSHA to state regulators and the public. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission, or the Commission, adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, amongst other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments also clarify the Commission's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The disposal well rule amendments became effective on November 17, 2014. Also, in May 2013, the Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. On May 16, 2013, the DOI issued a revised proposed rule that seeks to require companies operating on federal and Indian lands to (i) publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process; (ii) confirm their wells meet certain construction standards; and (iii) establish site plans to manage flowback water. The DOI announced its intent to finalize the rule in 2014, however, the final rule remains pending. These or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional or tight formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business and make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings.\nIn addition, on October 20, 2011, the EPA announced its intention to develop federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the new pretreatment rules will require shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities. Proposed rules are expected in early 2015. We cannot predict the impact that these standards may have on our business at this time, but these standards could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn addition, in August 2012, the EPA adopted rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP, programs. The rule includes NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or \"green completions\" on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. These rules may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. The EPA intends to issue revised rules that are likely responsive to some of these requests. On September 23, 2013, the EPA finalized the portion of the rule addressing VOC emissions from storage tanks, including a phase-in period and an alternative emissions limit for older tanks. On December 19, 2014, the EPA released final updates and clarifications to the NSPS standards.\nIf hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations. In addition, the third parties on whom we rely on for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nOur oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \"Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nIn addition, the operations of the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that require obtaining and maintaining numerous permits, approvals and certifications from various federal, state and local government authorities. These third parties may incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If existing laws and regulations governing such third-party services are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to their operations, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such services. Similarly, a failure to comply with such laws and regulations by the third parties on whom we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \"Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters\nand Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the third parties on whom we rely.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nOn April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, that the CAA definition of \"pollutant\" includes carbon dioxide and other GHGs and, therefore, the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. Thereafter, on December 15, 2009, the EPA published its findings that GHG emissions present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climate changes. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in January 2011, purports to limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the Tailoring Rule in May 2010, and it also became effective January 2011. The Tailoring Rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the PSD and Title V programs of the CAA. On June 23, 2014, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memorandums providing initial guidance on GHG permitting requirements in response to the Court's decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. In its preliminary guidance, the EPA indicates it will undertake a rulemaking action no later than December 31, 2015 to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the Tailoring Rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted \"no action assurance\" indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to GHGs in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit.\nIn September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In addition, the EPA has continued to adopt GHG regulations of other industries, such as a September 2013 proposed GHG rule that, if finalized, would set New Source Performance Standards for new coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants.\nIn addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce the emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Furthermore, some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.\nThe EPA reporting rule and the adoption of any legislation or regulations that otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to monitor and report GHG emissions, purchase and operate emissions control systems to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thus could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \"Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation.\"\nOur operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of stringent and complex environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas development and production operations. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including that they may (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; (iii) govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations; and (viii) require that additional pollution controls be installed. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or\ncostly waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Please read \"Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for more information.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.\nAlthough some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC has issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule, which we refer to as the \"Mandatory Clearing Rule,\" requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have), establishing an \"end-user\" exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, which we refer to as the \"End-User Exception,\" and a rule, subsequently vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and remanded to the CFTC for further proceedings, imposing position limits. The CFTC proposed a new version of this rule, which we refer to as the \"Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule,\" with respect to which the comment period has closed but a final rule has not been issued. In addition, the CFTC and bank regulators re-proposed rules, which we refer to as the \"Re-Proposed SD/MSP Margin Rules,\" which, if adopted, would require that swap dealers and major swap participants receive initial and variation margin on uncleared swaps with financial end-users with material swaps exposures, swap dealers and major swap participants.\nWe qualify for and will utilize the End-User Exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule if it is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate, our hedging and other activities are such that we will not be required to post margin under the Re-Proposed SD/MSP Margin Rules, if adopted, and the quantities under the swaps in which we participate are well within applicable limits under the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End-User Exception and, if the Re-Proposed SD/MSP Margin Rules are adopted, will be subject to such rule and required to post margin in accordance with such rule in connection with their swaps with other swap dealers and major swap participants. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, and, to the extent that the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule and the Re-Proposed SD/MSP Margin Rules are ultimately effected, such proposed rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts (including through our being required to post collateral), materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could\ntherefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nWe may incur more taxes and certain of our projects may become uneconomic if certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production are eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nLegislation is proposed from time to time that contains proposals to eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These proposals include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any of the foregoing proposals will actually be enacted or how soon any such changes in law could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate and/or defer certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Any such change could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing the after-tax costs we incur which would in turn make it uneconomic to drill some locations if commodity prices are not sufficiently high, resulting in lower revenues and decreases in production and reserves.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Finally, our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer to acquire us may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nWe, including our officers and directors, are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time. Certain of these legal proceedings may be a significant distraction to management and could expose our Company to significant liability, including damages, fines, penalties and attorneys' fees and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe discuss the risks and uncertainties related to our litigation in more detail below in \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nWe are required to comply with laws, regulations and requirements, including the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NYSE with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements requires a significant amount of time from our board of directors and management and has significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made such compliance more time-consuming and costly. As compared to a private company, among other things, we are required to:\n\u2022 maintain a more comprehensive compliance function;\n\u2022 design, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022 comply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;\n\u2022 prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022 maintain internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u2022 involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\u2022 maintain an investor relations function.\nIn addition, as a public company subject to these rules and regulations, it may become more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept greater coverage than we desire or to incur substantial costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members to serve on our board of directors, particularly the audit committee of the board of directors (the \"Audit Committee\").\nOur efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and comply with the certification and reporting obligations under Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, our remediation efforts may not enable us to remedy or avoid material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future. Any failure to remediate material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in our implementation or improvement of our internal controls over financial reporting could result in material misstatements that are not prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NYSE or other regulatory authorities. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014 as a result of our identification of one material weakness related to an over-estimation of future development costs in the year-end reserve report. A material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us.\nControls over the estimation and review of our future development costs were not designed appropriately resulting in the estimates of future development costs in the reserve report not being adequately reduced for incurred and accrued current period drilling costs, and future development costs being over-estimated by approximately $85 million. This resulted in a control deficiency related to the estimation of future development costs included in the reserve report as of December 31, 2014.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of December 31, 2014, we identified a material weakness related to our future development cost estimates on the year-end reserve report. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see \"Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\" included in Item 9A of this report.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Further, the complexities of our quarter-end and year-end closing processes increase the risk that a weakness in internal controls over financial reporting may go undetected. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. We are working to remediate the material weakness discussed above and have begun taking steps and plan to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weakness, primarily through the improvement of communication between accounting and engineering personnel and enhancing the review process over the inputs to the reserve report, which are further described in Item 9A of this report. We plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible. However, if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and the NYSE, including a delisting from the NYSE, securities litigation, debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals, any one of which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects.\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with members of the Sanchez Group regarding our past, ongoing and future relationships and the resolution of these conflicts may not be favorable to us.\nConflicts of interest may arise between members of the Sanchez Group and us in a number of areas relating to our past, ongoing and future relationships, including:\n\u2022 labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising under agreements with SOG;\n\u2022 employee recruiting and retention;\n\u2022 business opportunities that may be attractive to both members of the Sanchez Group and us; and\n\u2022 business transactions that we enter into with members of the Sanchez Group.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nFinally, in connection with the IPO, we entered into several agreements with members of the Sanchez Group. These agreements were made in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship. The terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.\nPursuant to the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation, members of the Sanchez Group are not required to offer corporate opportunities to us, and our directors and officers may be permitted to offer certain corporate opportunities to members of the Sanchez Group before us.\nOur board of directors includes persons who are also directors and/or officers of members of the Sanchez Group. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\n\u2022 members of the Sanchez Group are free to compete with us in any activity or line of business;\n\u2022 we do not have any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity, transaction, or other matter in which members of the Sanchez Group engage or seek to engage merely because we engage in the same or similar lines of business;\n\u2022 to the fullest extent permitted by law, members of the Sanchez Group will have no duty to communicate their knowledge of, or offer, any potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter to us, and members of the Sanchez Group are free to pursue or acquire such business opportunity, transaction, or other matter for themselves or direct the business opportunity, transaction, or other matter to its affiliates; and\n\u2022 if any director or officer of any member of the Sanchez Group who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that business opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that business opportunity to such member of the Sanchez Group and that director or officer will not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to have (1) breached or acted in a manner inconsistent with or opposed to his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the business opportunity or (2) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests or those of our stockholders.\nWe depend on SOG to provide us with certain services for our business. The services that SOG provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and we may have difficulty finding replacement services or be required to pay increased costs to replace these services after our agreements with SOG expire.\nCertain services required by us for the operation of our business, including general and administrative services, geological, geophysical and reserve engineering, lease and land administration, marketing, accounting, operational services, information technology services, compliance, insurance maintenance and management of outside professionals, are provided by SOG pursuant to the Services Agreement. The services provided under the Services Agreement commenced on the date that the IPO closed and will terminate five years thereafter. The term automatically extends for additional 12-month periods and is terminable by either party at any time upon 180 days' written notice. See \"Corporate Governance-Compensation Committee\" in the proxy statement for the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, which is incorporated by reference to this report. While these services are being provided to us by SOG, our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited. After the expiration or termination of this agreement, we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we will receive from SOG under our agreements with SOG.\nIn addition, SOG may outsource some or all of these services to third parties, and a failure of all or part of SOG's relationships with its outsourcing providers could lead to delays in or interruptions of these services. Our reliance on SOG and others as service providers and on SOG's outsourcing relationships, and our limited ability to control certain costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our total outstanding shares is held by members of the Sanchez Group and may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of December 31, 2014, members of the Sanchez Group owned, in the aggregate, approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock. These shares are eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In addition, under certain circumstances, these persons have the right to require us to register the resale of their shares. Moreover, we have registered all of the shares of our common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance unless, pursuant to their terms, these stock awards have transfer restrictions attached to them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13139, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SNECQ"}
