{"cik": "1054102", "company": "Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes in Part II - Item 8, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our business, operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or businesses in general, such as competitive conditions, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur molecular diagnostics business has limited revenue, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn 2014, we acquired RedPath and certain assets from Asuragen. As a result, we now offer four products commercially; PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGenX\u00ae, ThyraMIR\u00ae and RespriDX\u2122 and to a limited extent via our CEP Program, BarreGEN\u00ae. The revenue generated from our molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics business was $15.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we had an operating loss of approximately $6.3 million. Although we expect our revenue to grow in the future, there can be no assurance that we will achieve revenue sufficient to offset expenses. Over the next several years, we expect to continue to devote resources to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, our molecular diagnostic tests and to use our bioinformatics data and to develop and acquire additional products and services. However, our business may never achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and other licensors.\nIn connection with our acquisition of certain assets of Asuragen in 2014, we are obligated to make certain royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and other licensors. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae thyroid platform (i.e. ThyGenX\u00ae) through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests (i.e. ThyraMIR\u00ae) for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale. A similar obligation exists for the same periods, if we elect to launch any molecular tests from the miRInform\u00ae pancreas platform.\nEven if we are able to successfully launch the above referenced diagnostic tests, our profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty payments to Asuragen. Although we believe, under such circumstances, that the increase in revenue will exceed the corresponding royalty payments, our obligations to Asuragen and other licensors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to manage our operating costs and expenses at profitable levels.\nOur inability to finance our business on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic solutions and technologies and grow our business.\nWe expect capital expenditures and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure and commercial operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $15.2 million, net accounts receivable of $3.4 million, total current assets of $19.8 million and total current liabilities of $8.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a net loss of $12.2 million and cash used in operating activities was $15.3 million, including non-recurring charges. Additionally, during 2017, we raised net equity capital of approximately $29.9 million. While our overall cash position has improved, our business is not currently cash flow breakeven or positive, and as a result, we may need to finance our business in the future through collaborations, equity offerings, debt financings, licensing arrangements or other dilutive or non-dilutive means. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise funds by issuing additional equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. In addition, we granted each institutional investor who participated in the registered direct offering completed on January 6, 2017, the right, for a period of 15 months following January 6, 2017, or until April 6, 2018, to participate in any public or private offering by us of equity securities, subject to certain exceptions, up to such investor\u2019s pro rata portion of 50% of the securities being offered, or the Participation Right. If we fail to comply with the applicable provisions of the Participation Right or do not receive waivers from such investors, we may not be able to raise funds through another equity offering, but only through the period ending April 6, 2018. In other instances, the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nOur financial results currently depend solely on sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these and other molecular diagnostic products and/or solutions that we develop or acquire to grow our business.\nThe majority of our revenue currently is derived from the sale of our molecular diagnostic tests, which we initially launched commercially in the second half of 2014. We have several additional molecular diagnostics tests and complimentary service extensions that we have recently launched or are in late stage development, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or sufficiently grow those tests. If we are unable to increase sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, expand reimbursement for these tests, or successfully develop and commercialize other molecular diagnostic tests, our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability would be impaired, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history as a molecular diagnostics company, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1986 and began commercial operations in 1987. In connection with our initial public offering, we re-incorporated in Delaware in 1998. From 1987 until 2015, our operations focused primarily on our CSO business, which provided the personal promotion of pharmaceutical customers\u2019 products through outsourced sales teams. We now conduct our molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics business through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Interpace LLC, which was formed in Delaware in 2013, and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation (formerly known as RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc.), which was formed in Delaware in 2007. We began our own commercial sales of our molecular diagnostic tests in late 2014. Consequently, any evaluations about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nThe loss of members of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nAs a small company with 75 employees, the success of our business depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of members of our senior management team and others in key management positions. The efforts of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to grow our molecular diagnostics business and develop and/or acquire additional molecular diagnostic tests. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy. In addition, our commercial laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, including licensed clinical laboratory scientists. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel, and we may have to pay higher salaries to attract and retain qualified personnel. We may also be at a disadvantage in recruiting and retaining key personnel as our small size, limited resources, limited liquidity and changes in the last two years in our senior management team may be viewed as providing a less stable environment, with fewer opportunities than would be the case at one of our larger competitors. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to support our clinical laboratory and commercialization.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe depend on a few payers for a significant portion of our revenue, and if one or more significant payers stops providing reimbursement or decreases the amount of reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests, our revenue could decline.\nRevenue for tests performed on patients covered by Medicare was approximately 38% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The percentage of our revenue derived from significant payers is expected to fluctuate from period to period as our revenue increases, as additional payers provide reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests or if one or more payers were to stop reimbursing for our molecular diagnostic tests or changed their reimbursed amounts.\nNovitas Solutions has been the regional MAC that handles claims processing for Medicare services with jurisdiction for PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGenX\u00ae, ThyraMIR\u00ae, BarreGEN\u00ae and RespriDX\u2122 On a five-year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional MAC services. Any future changes in the MAC processing or coding for Medicare claims for our molecular diagnostic tests could result in a change in the coverage or reimbursement rates for such molecular diagnostic tests, or the loss of coverage.\nOur PancraGEN\u00ae and ThyGenX\u00ae tests are reimbursed by Medicare based on applicable CPT codes. PancraGEN\u00ae is currently reimbursed by Medicare at $3,038 per test, ThyGenX\u00ae, previously reimbursed at $1,054 per test, is currently reimbursed by Medicare at $1,515 per test, effective January 1, 2018, and ThyraMIR\u00ae is currently reimbursed by Medicare at $2,195 per test. RespriDX\u2122 is currently only covered by the Medicare Advantage program and our BarreGEN\u00ae assay is not reimbursed at all. Any future reduction from the current rate would have a material adverse effect on business and results of operations.\nAlthough we have entered into contracts with certain third-party payers which establish in-network allowable rates of reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests, payers may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. Any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue.\nIf payers do not provide reimbursement, rescind or modify their reimbursement policies or delay payments for our tests, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate additional reimbursement contracts, our commercial success could be compromised.\nPhysicians may generally not order our tests unless payers reimburse a substantial portion of the test price. There is uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement of any test incorporating new molecular diagnostic technology. Reimbursement by a payer may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\u2019s determination that tests such as our molecular diagnostic tests are: (a) not experimental or investigational; (b) pre-authorized and appropriate for the patient; (c) cost-effective; (d) supported by peer-reviewed publications; and (e) included in clinical practice guidelines. Since each payer generally makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to reimburse our tests, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. Although we have contracted rates of reimbursement with certain payers, which establishes in-network allowable rates of reimbursement for our PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGenX\u00ae, ThyraMIR\u00ae and RespriDX\u2122 assays, payers may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. Any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue.\nWe have contracted rates of reimbursement with select payers for our PancraGEN\u00ae, ThyGenX\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae and to a limited extent, RespriDX\u2122. Without a contracted rate for reimbursement, claims may be denied upon submission, and we may need to appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. We expect to continue to focus resources on increasing adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot, however, predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse us for our molecular diagnostic tests, if at all. In addition to our current commercial products on the market and in our pipeline, the launch of any new molecular diagnostic tests in the future may require that we expend substantial time and resources in order to obtain and retain reimbursement. Also, payer consolidation can create uncertainty as to whether coverage and contracts with existing payers will even remain in effect. Finally, commercial payers may tie their allowable rates to Medicare rates, and should Medicare reduce their rates, we may be negatively impacted. If we fail to establish broad adoption of and reimbursement for our assays, or if we are unable to maintain existing reimbursement from payers, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if physicians decide not to order our molecular diagnostic tests.\nIf we are unable to create or maintain demand for our molecular diagnostic tests in sufficient volume or if we are unable to expand our product offerings, we may not become profitable. To generate demand, we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education by our internal sales force. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers will be critical to generating revenue.\nIn many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. Accordingly, physicians may be reluctant to order a diagnostic test that may suggest surgery is unnecessary. In addition, our assays are performed at our laboratories rather than by a pathologist in a local laboratory, so pathologists may be reluctant to support our tests. In addition, guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules may change to recommend another type of treatment protocol, and these changes may result in medical practitioners deciding not to use our molecular diagnostic tests. These facts may make physicians reluctant to convert to using our assays, which could limit our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if patients decide not to use our molecular diagnostic tests.\nSome patients may decide not to use our molecular diagnostic tests due to price, all or part of which may be payable directly by the patient if the patient\u2019s insurer denies reimbursement in full or in part. Many insurers seek to shift more of the cost of healthcare to patients in the form of higher deductibles, co-payments, or premiums. In addition, the economic environment in the United States may result in the loss of healthcare coverage. Implementation of provisions of PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act) provided coverage for patients, particularly in the individual market, who were previously either uninsured or faced high premiums. However, premiums for the plans participating in the exchanges established as part of this legislation have increased and some health plans have chosen to drop out of these networks in specific markers or the program altogether. These events may result in patients dropping coverage and therefore delaying or forgoing medical checkups or treatment due to their inability to pay for our test, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue. In addition, the President of the United States has announced that he favors repealing PPACA in 2017, and leaders of the Republican-controlled federal legislature also have expressed a desire to repeal PPACA. The scope and timing of any legislation to repeal, amend, replace, or reform PPACA is uncertain, but if such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare system and our revenues. We do have a Patient Assistance Program that allows eligible patients to apply for assistance in covering a portion of their out of pocket obligation or all costs for claims denied as non-covered if they meet the criteria for participation; however, there is no guarantee that this Program will be sufficient to influence patients to agree to have their physician order our molecular tests on their behalf.\nIf our products do not perform as expected, we may not be able to achieve widespread market adoption among physicians, which would cause our operating results, reputation, and business to suffer.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality molecular information products. There is no guarantee that the accuracy and reproducibility we have demonstrated to date will continue, particularly for clinical samples, as our test volume increases. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors, including if our products fail to detect genomic alterations with high accuracy from clinical specimens or if we fail to list, or inaccurately include, certain treatment options and available clinical trials in our product reports. As a result, the failure of our products to perform as expected would significantly impair our operating results and our reputation. We may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nIf we lose the support of key thought leaders, it may be difficult to establish products enabled by our molecular information platform as a standard of care for patients with cancer, which may limit our revenue growth and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe have established relationships with leading oncology thought leaders at premier cancer institutions and oncology networks. If these key thought leaders determine that our molecular information platform, our existing products or other products that we develop are not clinically effective, that alternative technologies are more effective, or if they elect to use internally developed products, we would encounter significant difficulty validating our testing platform, driving adoption, or establishing our molecular information platform and tests as a standard of care, which would limit our revenue growth and our ability to achieve profitability.\nIf we cannot maintain our current relationships, or enter into new relationships, with biopharmaceutical companies, our product development could be delayed.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to expand our direct sales and marketing force to adequately address our customer\u2019s needs, our business may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we have been selling commercial products since 2014, genomic diagnostics is a new area of science, and we continue to focus and refine our efforts to sell, market and receive reimbursement for our products. We may not be able to market, sell, or distribute our existing products or other products we may develop effectively enough to support our planned growth.\nOur future sales will depend in large part on our ability to develop, and substantially expand, our sales force and to increase the scope of our marketing efforts. Our target market of physicians is a large and diverse market. As a result, we believe it is necessary to develop a sales force that includes sales representatives with specific technical backgrounds. We will also need to attract and develop marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such employees is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force, which could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and limit our revenue growth and potential profitability.\nOur expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality.\nIf our internal sales force is less successful than anticipated, our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability to generate revenues could be diminished. In addition, we have limited history selling our molecular diagnostics tests on a direct basis and our limited history makes forecasting difficult.\nIf our internal sales force is not successful, or new additions to our sales team fail to gain traction among our customers, we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our molecular diagnostic tests. If we fail to establish our molecular diagnostic tests in the marketplace, it could have a negative effect on our ability to sell subsequent molecular diagnostic tests and hinder the desired expansion of our business. We have growing, however limited, historical experience forecasting the direct sales of our molecular diagnostics products. Our ability to produce product quantities that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to forecast accurately and plan production accordingly.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nDue to how we recognize revenue, our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate.\nDuring 2017 and 2016 we recognized a significant portion of our revenue when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We have little visibility as to when we will receive payment for our molecular diagnostic tests, and we must appeal negative payment decisions, which delays collections. For molecular diagnostic tests performed where we have an agreed upon reimbursement rate or we are able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement at the time delivery is complete, such as in the case of Medicare and certain other payers, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to collect. We determined the amount we expect to collect based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis. In situations where we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement, we recognize revenue upon the earlier of receipt of third-party notification of payment or when cash is received. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received from Medicare and other payers where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous estimates and the contractual allowance is adjusted accordingly.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d (or \u201cASC 606\u201d), and beginning January 1, 2018 and going forward, under this new accounting revenue standard, most revenues will be recognized on the accrual basis, for the most part based upon actual collection histories for our tests and respective payers or payer groups, where a commonality exists. These measurements will likely initially result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenue. As we recognize revenue from payers on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated reimbursement in fact change, or were incorrect at the time we accrued such revenue, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition, these fluctuations in revenue may make it difficult in the near term for us, research analysts and investors to accurately forecast our revenue and operating results. If our revenue or operating results fall below consensus expectations, the price of our common stock would likely decline.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for some of the materials used in our molecular diagnostic tests, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers in a timely manner.\nWe often rely on sole suppliers for certain materials that we use to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, including Asuragen for our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests pursuant to our supply agreement with them. We also purchase reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests from sole-source suppliers. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in molecular diagnostic test processing could occur. Any such interruption may directly impact our revenue and cause us to incur higher costs.\nWe may experience problems in scaling our operations, or delays or reagent and supply shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue.\nIf we encounter difficulties in scaling our operations as a result of, among other things, quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of reagents and raw material supplies, we will likely experience reduced sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, increased repair or re-engineering costs, and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers, any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins.\nAlthough we attempt to match our capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand, to the extent demand materially varies from our estimates, we may experience constraints in our operations and delivery capacity, which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period. Should our need for raw materials and reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests fluctuate, we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials or reagents.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf we are unable to support demand for our molecular diagnostic tests or any of our future tests or solutions, our business could suffer.\nAs demand for our molecular diagnostic tests grows, we will also need to continue to scale up our testing capacity and processing technology, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot assure you that increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be implemented successfully or that appropriate personnel will be available. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs of processing tests or inability to meet demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability.\nWe compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal, endocrine and lung cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our tests in order to impact clinical practices. In addition, we face competition from other companies that offer diagnostic tests. Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte has thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic tests that compete with our ThyGenX\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae tests, which are currently on the market. Quest currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGenX\u00ae test, and CBL is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing. Other competitors for our thyroid assays include Rosetta Genomics, Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Cancer Genetics, Inc., Genomic Health Inc., NeoGenomics Inc. and Trovagene, Inc. While we do not believe we currently have significant direct competition for PancraGEN\u00ae in the gastrointestinal market, there is the potential for indirect competition as well as significant direct competition due to the limited penetration we currently have of this market.\nIt is also possible that we face future competition from LDTs developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and/or other diagnostic companies developing new molecular diagnostic tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of the new, unforeseen technologies that can be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nTo compete successfully, we must be able to demonstrate, among other things, that our test results are accurate and cost effective, and we must secure a meaningful level of reimbursement for our tests. Since our molecular diagnostics business began in 2014, many of our potential competitors have stronger brand recognition and greater financial capabilities than we do. Others may develop a test with a lower price than ours that could be viewed by physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our molecular diagnostic tests or offer a test at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the price of our molecular diagnostic tests and affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests and overall sales, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As we add new molecular diagnostic tests and other products and services, we will likely face many of these same competitive risks that we do currently.\nDeveloping new molecular diagnostic tests and related services and solutions involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other assays under development.\nDeveloping new molecular diagnostic tests and related services and solutions will require us to devote considerable resources to research and development. We may face challenges obtaining sufficient numbers of samples to validate a newly acquired or developed molecular diagnostic test. In order to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic tests, we need to:\n\u25cf expend significant funds to conduct substantial research and development;\n\u25cf conduct successful analytical and clinical studies;\n\u25cf scale our laboratory processes to accommodate new molecular diagnostic tests; and\n\u25cf build the commercial infrastructure to market and sell new molecular diagnostic tests.\nTypically, few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a molecular diagnostic test or related services or solutions or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies, which would adversely affect the timing for generating revenue from such test. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study or if we fail to sufficiently demonstrate analytical validity, we might choose to abandon the development of the molecular diagnostic test, which could harm our business. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize new competing molecular diagnostic tests faster than us or at a lower cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new products in the future.\nIn the future, we may license third-party technology to develop or commercialize new products. In return for the use of a third-party\u2019s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our solutions. Royalties are a component of cost of revenue and affect the margins on our solutions. We may also need to negotiate licenses to patents and patent applications after introducing a commercial product. Our business may suffer if we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are and may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. If we do not prevail in the legal proceedings, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our assumption of the liability for the Settlement Agreement with the Department of Justice entered into by the former owners of Redpath may not lead to greater exposure than we anticipated.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf we are unable to develop or acquire molecular diagnostic tests to keep pace with rapid technological, medical and scientific change, our operating results and competitive position could be affected.\nRecently, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to diagnostics, particularly diagnostics that are based on genomic information. These advances require us to continuously develop our technology and to work to develop new solutions to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our solutions could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand our product offerings to include new clinical applications. If we are unable to develop or acquire new molecular diagnostic tests or to demonstrate the applicability of our molecular diagnostic tests for other diseases, our sales could decline and our competitive position could be harmed.\nIf we cannot enter into new clinical study collaborations, our product development and subsequent commercialization could be delayed.\nIn the past, we have entered into clinical study collaborations, and our success in the future depends in part on our ability to enter into additional collaborations with highly regarded institutions. This can be difficult due to internal and external constraints placed on these organizations. Some organizations may limit the number of collaborations they have with any one company so as to not be perceived as biased or conflicted. Organizations may also have insufficient administrative and related infrastructure to enable collaboration with many companies at once, which can extend the time it takes to develop, negotiate and implement a collaboration. Moreover, it may take longer to obtain the samples we need which could delay our trials, publications, and product launches and reimbursement. Additionally, organizations often insist on retaining the rights to publish the clinical data resulting from the collaboration. The publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining reimbursement for our diagnostic tests, and our inability to control when and if results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenue from them.\nIf a catastrophe strikes either of our laboratories or if either of our laboratories becomes inoperable for any other reason, we will be unable to perform our testing services and our business will be harmed.\nThe laboratories and equipment we use to perform our tests would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to replace and qualify for use if they became inoperable. Either of our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our testing services for some period of time or to receive and store samples. The inability to perform our tests for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers in the future. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were to begin to enforce regulation of our molecular diagnostic tests, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and costs associated with complying with post-market requirements.\nClinical laboratory tests like our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA as well as by applicable State laws. LDTs are currently subject to enforcement discretion by the FDA, although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to other regulation. In October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,\u201d which provides an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. LDT manufacturers will be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA\u2019s approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nOn November 18, 2016, however, the FDA announced that it would not release final versions of these guidance documents and would instead continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on LDTs outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. According to the 2017 discussion paper, previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements (grandfathering), except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm. Since LDTs currently on the market would be grandfathered in, pre-market review of new and significantly modified LDTs could be phased-in over a four-year period, as opposed to the nine years proposed in the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance. In addition, tests introduced after the effective date, but before their phase-in date, could continue to be offered during pre-market review.\nThe discussion paper notes that FDA will focus on analytical and clinical validity as the basis for marketing authorization. The FDA anticipates laboratories that already conduct proper validation should not be expected to experience new costs for validating their tests to support marketing authorization and laboratories that conduct appropriate evaluations would not have to collect additional data to demonstrate analytical validity for FDA clearance or approval. The evidence of the analytical and clinical validity of all LDTs will be made publically available. LDTs are encouraged to submit prospective change protocols in their pre-market submission that outline specific types of anticipated changes, the procedures that will be followed to implement them and the criteria that will be met prior to implementation.\nDespite the FDA decision not release the guidance at this time, it can choose to release the guidance at any time in the future. If the guidance is released and pre-market review is required, our business could be negatively impacted as a result of commercial delay that may be caused by the new requirements. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support pre-market applications may be significant. If we are required to submit applications for our currently-marketed tests, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which may be time-consuming and costly and could result in our currently-marketed tests being withdrawn from the market. Continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. There are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements that are ultimately imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes.\nIf we fail to comply with Federal, State and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA regulations, a Federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific personnel qualifications, facilities administration, quality systems, inspections and proficiency testing. CLIA certification is also required in order for us to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for our molecular diagnostic tests. To renew these certifications, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. We are also required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our New Haven, Connecticut and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania laboratories. Connecticut and Pennsylvania laws require that we maintain a license, and establish standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory in New Haven, Connecticut and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island. California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under the laws of each respective State regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California, Florida, Maryland, New York or Rhode Island. In 2016, we received final approval for our ThyGenX\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae assays in New York State. If we were unable to obtain or lose our CLIA certificate for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our current molecular diagnostic tests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to lose our licenses issued by New York or by other States where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those States. New molecular diagnostic tests we may develop may be subject to new approvals by governmental bodies such as New York State, and we may not be able to offer our new molecular diagnostic tests to patients in such jurisdictions until such approvals are received.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nRecent legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nPPACA made changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. Since 2013, each medical device manufacturer must pay a sales tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices that are listed with the FDA. The FDA\u2019s final guidance on LDTs may require our molecular diagnostic tests to be regulated as medical devices. However, consistent with the FDA\u2019s policy of exercising enforcement discretion for LDTs, our molecular diagnostic tests are not currently listed as medical devices with the FDA. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was adopted, which included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The moratorium will end on January 1, 2020, and we cannot assure that the tax will not be extended to services such as ours in the future if our tests were to be regulated as devices.\nOther significant measures contained in PPACA include, for example, coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. PPACA also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. In addition, PPACA establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative effect on payment rates for services. The IPAB proposals could have affected payments for clinical laboratory services beginning in 2016 and may affect those for hospital services beginning in 2020. We are monitoring the effect of PPACA to determine the trends and any potential changes that may be necessitated by the legislation, any of which may potentially affect our business.\nPPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. At the same time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the PPACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the PPACA would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future.\nFollowing the 2016 U.S. general election, a single party now leads the executive branch and holds majorities in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The President of the United States has announced that he favors repealing PPACA, and leaders of the Republication-controlled federal legislature also have expressed a desire to repeal PPACA. The scope and timing of any legislation to repeal, amend, replace, or reform PPACA is uncertain, but if such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare system.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nOn January 20, 2017, the new administration signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with PPACA pending further action by Congress. On the same day, the White House issued a regulatory freeze memo under which rules and guidance published but not yet effective must be frozen for 60 days pending review; rules and guidance submitted for publication but not yet published must be withdrawn; and rules and guidance not yet submitted for publication must not be submitted without further direction from the Administration. Since then, further executive orders and statements from the White House and Congress have addressed potential regulatory changes that could affect us and our customers. Changes to, or repeal of, PPACA may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable.\nIn addition to PPACA, the effect of which cannot presently be fully quantified, various healthcare reform proposals have periodically emerged from Federal and State governments. For example, in February 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which reduced the clinical laboratory payment rates on the Medicare CLFS by 2% in 2013. In addition, a further reduction of 2% was implemented under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which is to be in effect for dates of service on or after April 1, 2013 until fiscal year 2024. Reductions resulting from the Congressional sequester are applied to total claim payments made; however, they do not currently result in a rebasing of the negotiated or established Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nState legislation on reimbursement applies to Medicaid reimbursement and Managed Medicaid reimbursement rates within that State. Some States have passed or proposed legislation that would revise reimbursement methodology for clinical laboratory payment rates under those Medicaid programs. For example, California\u2019s Department of Health Care Services implemented a new rate methodology for clinical laboratories and laboratory services, effective July 2015, that involves the use of a range of rates that fell between zero and 80% of the calculated California Medicare rate and the calculation of a weighted average (based on units billed) of such rates.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the Federal or State level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by Federal legislation, cost reduction measures and the expansion in the role of the U.S. government in the healthcare industry may result in decreased revenue, lower reimbursement by payers for our tests or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOngoing calls for deficit reduction at the Federal government level and reforms to programs such as the Medicare program to pay for such reductions may affect the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. In particular, recommendations by the Simpson-Bowles Commission called for the combination of Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (physician and ancillary service insurance) into a single co-insurance and co-payment structure. Currently, clinical laboratory services are excluded from the Medicare Part B co-insurance and co-payment as preventative services. Combining Parts A and B may require clinical laboratories to collect co-payments from patients, which may increase our costs and reduce the amount ultimately collected.\nIn 2013, CMS announced plans to bundle payments for clinical laboratory tests together with other services performed during hospital outpatient visits under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. CMS exempted molecular diagnostic tests from this packaging provision at that time. It is possible that this exemption could be removed by CMS in future rule making, which might result in lower reimbursement for tests performed in this setting.\nPAMA includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. Laboratories that receive a majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS and the Physician Fee Schedule must report on triennial bases (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, or ADLTs), private payer rates and volumes for their tests with specific CPT codes based on final payments made during a set period of data collection (the first of which was January 1 through June 30, 2016).\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIn April 2014, the President signed PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. PAMA removed CMS\u2019s authority to adjust the CLFS based and established a new method for setting CLFS rates. Implementation of this new method for setting CLFS rates began in 2016. Under PAMA, laboratories that have more than $12,500 in Medicare revenues from laboratory services and that receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from laboratory services would report private payer data from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, to CMS between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2017. CMS posted the new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payer rates) in November 2017 and the new rates became effective beginning on January 1, 2018. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10 % per test per year in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2020 through 2022. CMS has issued draft regulations regarding these changes. Further rule-making from CMS will define the time period and data elements evaluated on an annual basis to set reimbursement rates for tests like ours. Under the revised Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is scheduled to be reduced in 2018, 2019 and 2020, though the result of the 2018 calculations was an increase in our reimbursement rate for ThyGenX of approximately 40% for our Medicare volume. PAMA calls for further revisions of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; further reductions in reimbursement may result from such revisions.\nThere have also been recent and substantial changes to the payment structure for physicians, including changes passed under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which was signed into law on April 16, 2015. MACRA created the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System which, beginning in 2019, more closely aligns physician payments with composite performance on performance metrics similar to three existing incentive programs (i.e., the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value-Based Modifier program and the Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use program), and incentivizes physicians to enroll in alternative payment methods. At this time, we do not know whether these changes to the physician payment systems will have any impact on orders or payments for our tests.\nIn December 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which, among other things, revised the process for Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). CMS and the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) are in the process of implementing these revisions and we cannot predict whether these revisions will delay coverage for our test products, which could have a material negative impact on revenue.\nComplying with numerous statutes and regulations pertaining to our molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to regulation by both the Federal government and the governments of the states in which we conduct our molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics business, including:\n\u25cf The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as supplemented by various other statutes;\n\u25cf The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, the amendments thereto, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and contained in 21 C.F.R. Parts 203 and 205;\n\u25cf CLIA and State licensing requirements;\n\u25cf Manufacturing and promotion laws;\n\u25cf Medicare billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u25cf The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and state equivalents), which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a Federal healthcare program;\n\u25cf The Federal Stark physician self-referral law (and state equivalents), which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition;\n\u25cf HIPAA, which established comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments made in 2013 to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general, and impose requirements for breach notification;\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n\u25cf The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n\u25cf The Federal False Claims Act (and state equivalents), which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u25cf Other Federal and State fraud and abuse laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, prohibitions on the provision of products at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payer, including private insurers;\n\u25cf The prohibition on reassignment of Medicare claims, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the reassignment of Medicare claims to any other party;\n\u25cf The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires us to report private payer rates and test volumes for specific CPT codes on a triennial basis and imposes penalties for failures to report, omissions, or misrepresentations;\n\u25cf The rules regarding billing for diagnostic tests reimbursable by the Medicare program, which prohibit a physician or other supplier from marking up the price of the technical component or professional component of a diagnostic test ordered by the physician or other supplier and supervised or performed by a physician who does not \u201cshare a practice\u201d with the billing physician or supplier; and\n\u25cf State laws that prohibit other specified practices related to billing such as billing physicians for testing that they order, waiving coinsurance, co-payments, deductibles, and other amounts owed by patients, and billing a State Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to other payers.\nIn recent years U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices have increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry, as have Congress, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Defense. These bodies have all issued subpoenas and other requests for information to conduct investigations of, and commenced civil and criminal litigation against, healthcare companies based on financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance, product promotional practices and documentation, and coding and billing practices. Whistleblowers have filed numerous qui tam lawsuits against healthcare companies under the federal and state False Claims Acts in recent years, in part because the whistleblower can receive a portion of the government\u2019s recovery under such suits.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We periodically conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance with some of these laws and regulations is also subject to governmental review. The growth of our business may increase the potential of violating these laws, regulations or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Violations of Federal or State regulations may incur investigation or enforcement action by the FDA, Department of Justice, State agencies, or other legal authorities, and may result in substantial civil, criminal, or other sanctions. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, we could face possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal or State healthcare programs and we could even be required to cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nA failure to comply with Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties.\nWe retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of our business. These arrangements, like any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider, may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. Our arrangements are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark Laws, respectively. However, there are no guarantees that the Federal or State governments will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability under Federal and State laws. Under existing laws, all arrangements must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law, and there is no guarantee that the government will agree with our payment practices with respect to the relationships between our laboratories and the healthcare providers. A failure to comply with Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nWe currently have no international operations, but our business strategy may in the future include plans for international expansion. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as data protection laws, privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements (including requirements related to patient consent);\n\u25cf testing of genetic material and reporting the results of such testing and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses, or government delays in issuing such approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u25cf\nfailure by us to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacture, sale, and use of our products in various countries;\n\u25cf\nadditional, potentially relevant third-party intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities associated with obtaining reimbursement from and managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf\nlogistics and regulations associated with preparing, shipping, importing and exporting tissue samples, including infrastructure conditions, transportation delays, and customs;\n\u25cf\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to perform our molecular tests locally;\n\u25cf\nfinancial risks, such as the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions; and\n\u25cf\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distribution activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, including its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our revenue and results of operations. The difference in regulations under U.S. law and the laws of foreign countries may be significant and, in order to comply with the laws of foreign countries, we may have to implement global changes to our products or business practices. Such changes may result in additional expense to us and either reduce or delay product development, commercialization or sales. In addition, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our activities in these countries.\nOur international operations could be affected by changes in laws, trade regulations, labor and employment regulations, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of our products, as well as by inter-governmental disputes. Any of these changes could adversely affect our business.\nOur success internationally will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries in which we do business. Failure to manage these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThese laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws, any changes in these laws, or the interpretation.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.\nThe TCJA reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the TCJA, we revalued deferred tax assets, net as of December 31, 2017. The tax impact of revaluation of the deferred tax assets, net was $22,768,303, which was wholly offset by a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance of $22,768,303 resulting in a no net impact to our income tax expense.\nThe TCJA provided for a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits. The Company did not have consolidated accumulated earnings and profits attributable to it foreign subsidiaries, accordingly, the Company did not record any income tax expense related to the transition tax.\nDue to the timing of the new tax law and the substantial changes it brings, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d), which provides registrants a measurement period to report the impact of the new US tax law. During the measurement period, provisional amounts for the effects of the law are recorded to the extent a reasonable estimate can be made. To the extent that all information necessary is not available, prepared or analyzed, companies may recognize provisional estimated amounts for a period of up to one year following enactment of the TCJA.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.\nU. S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board are working to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow U.S. GAAP and those that are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. In connection with these initiatives, the FASB issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition that replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. We have completed our assessment of the new accounting standards for revenue recognition and believe that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on our financial reporting position or results of operations. The impact of the convergence of U.S. GAAP and IFRS, if any, on our financial statements is uncertain and may not be known until additional rules are proposed and adopted, which may or may not occur. Our financial statements are subject to change and if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nWe are subject to Federal, State and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling and disposal of biological material, chemicals and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs and any related penalties or fines, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to us or our third-party service providers could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nOur business requires that we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information about patients, credit card information, and our proprietary business and financial information. We face a number of risks relative to our protection of, and our service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, including loss of access, fraudulent modifications, inappropriate disclosure and inappropriate access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other activities. If such event would occur and cause interruptions in our operations, our networks would be compromised and the information we store on those networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, modified without our knowledge, lost or stolen. Unauthorized access, loss, modification or dissemination could disrupt our operations, including our ability to process tests, provide test results, bill payers or patients, process claims, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our solution and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf we are sued for product liability or errors and omissions liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our molecular diagnostic tests could lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that the molecular diagnostic test failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to physicians or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. A product liability or errors and omissions liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of such claims. Any product liability or errors and omissions liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our products and solutions. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nWe are a small company with approximately 75 employees. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, attract, retain, motivate and integrate highly skilled personnel. We may increase the number of employees in the future depending on the progress and growth of our business. Our future financial performance and our ability to sell our existing molecular diagnostic tests and develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic tests and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u25cf manage our clinical studies effectively;\n\u25cf integrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and regulatory personnel;\n\u25cf maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u25cf hire and train additional qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results. We may need to reduce the size of our organization in order to become profitable and we may experience difficulties in managing these reductions.\nBilling for our diagnostic tests is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our molecular diagnostic tests.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services is complex, time consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, including Medicare, insurance companies and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. To the extent laws or contracts require us to bill patient co-payments or co-insurance, we must also comply with these requirements. We may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including write-offs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Among others, the following factors make the billing process complex:\n\u25cf differences between the list price for our molecular diagnostic tests and the reimbursement rates of payers;\n\u25cf compliance with complex Federal and State regulations related to billing Medicare;\n\u25cf disputes among payers as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u25cf differences in coverage among payers and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u25cf differences in information and billing requirements among payers;\n\u25cf incorrect or missing billing information; and\n\u25cf the resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nAs we grow and introduce new tests and other services, we will likely need to add new codes to our billing process as well as our financial reporting systems. Failure or delays in effecting these changes in external billing and internal systems and processes could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow. Additionally, our billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees or contractors, challenge coverage and payment denials, assist patients in appealing claims, and undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Payers also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further complexity to the billing process. These billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our diagnostic solution, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.\nWe rely on a third-party to process and transmit claims to payers, and any delay in either could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nWe rely on Quadax, Inc., a third-party provider to provide overall processing of claims and to transmit the actual claims to payers based on the specific payer billing format. If claims for our molecular diagnostic tests are not submitted to payers on a timely basis, or if we are required to switch to a different provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process these claims and receipt of payments from payers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nEnacted healthcare reform legislation may increase our costs, impair our ability to adjust our pricing to match any such increased costs, and therefore could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current position is that we do not meet the definition of an \u201cApplicable Manufacturer\u201d under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act) and are therefore not subject to the disclosure or tax requirements contained in PPACA. If the government were to reach a different conclusion, our failure to disclose could result in significant monetary penalties and potential claims from certain third parties.\nPPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. At the same time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the PPACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the PPACA would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future.\nChanges in governmental regulation could negatively impact our business operations and increase our costs.\nThe pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries are subject to a high degree of governmental regulation. Significant changes in these regulations affecting our business could result in the imposition of additional restrictions on our business, additional costs to us in providing our molecular diagnostic tests to our customers or otherwise negatively impact our business operations. Changes in governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products could also reduce, eliminate or otherwise negatively impact our sales.\nIf we do not increase our revenues and successfully manage the size of our operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe majority of our operating expenses are personnel-related costs such as employee compensation and benefits, reagents and disposable supplies as well as the cost of infrastructure to support our operations, including facility space and equipment. We continuously review our personnel to determine whether we are fully utilizing their services. If we believe we are not in a position to fully utilize our personnel, we may make reductions to our workforce. If we are unable to achieve revenue growth in the future or fail to adjust our cost infrastructure to the appropriate level to support our revenues, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may acquire businesses or assets or make investments in other companies or molecular diagnostic technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of synergistic businesses or other related assets. If we make any further acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisition by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Integration of an acquired company or business will also likely require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. To finance any acquisitions or investments, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for these activities through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If these funds are raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Consummating an acquisition poses a number of risks including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial impact of an acquisition on our overall business;\n\u25cf an acquisition may require us to incur debt or other obligations, incur large and immediate write-offs, issue capital stock potentially dilutive to our stockholders or spend significant cash, or may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cf if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline;\n\u25cf worse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u25cf we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining key personnel, partners, customers or other key relationships, and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u25cf we may fail to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;\n\u25cf our customers may not accept new molecular diagnostic tests from our acquired businesses;\n\u25cf we may fail to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts of our acquired businesses;\n\u25cf we may fail to combine product offerings and product lines of our acquired businesses timely and efficiently;\n\u25cf an acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by stockholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;\n\u25cf an acquisition may involve significant contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources;\n\u25cf accounting for contingent payments requires significant judgment and changes to the assumptions used in determining the fair value of our contingent payments could lead to significant volatility in earnings;\n\u25cf acquisitions and subsequent integration of these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities; and\n\u25cf the costs of an unsuccessful acquisition may adversely affect our financial performance.\nAdditional risks of integration of an acquired business include:\n\u25cf differing information technology, internal control, financial reporting and record-keeping systems;\n\u25cf differences in accounting policies and procedures;\n\u25cf unanticipated additional transaction and integration-related costs;\n\u25cf facilities or operations of acquired businesses in remote locations and the inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments; and\n\u25cf new products, including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products may not have been adequately protected or that such products may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf our information technology and communications systems fail or we experience a significant interruption in their operation, our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology and communications systems. Increasingly, we are also dependent upon our ability to electronically interface with our customers. The failure of these systems to operate as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs. In addition, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our information technology and communications systems, including the information technology systems and services that are maintained by third party vendors, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fire, terrorist attacks, malicious attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power loss or failure of computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data networks. In 2017, the Company discovered malware installed on certain servers. The Company believes that the malware was intended to steal processing power and was not intended to obtain Company data. The Company does not believe that any data on the affected servers was accessed or comprised. The Company removed the malware, and has enhanced its cybersecurity procedures. Additionally, our core business is largely dependent on our partially internally developed and partially purchased Laboratory Information Management System of LIMS. If these systems or services become unavailable or suffer a security breach, or are uneconomical or impossible to update and modify, we may expend significant resources to address these problems, and our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have and may continue to experience intangible asset impairment charges.\nWe are required to evaluate the carrying value of intangibles at least annually, and between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant such a test. We review the recoverability of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value of the asset to its fair value measured by future discounted cash flows. This analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and, where applicable, judgments associated with, among other factors, the appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary. Writing down or reserving for other intangible assets or impairments would have a negative and unexpected impact on our net worth and could, among other things, affect our ability to maintain our NASDAQ listing on a longer term basis.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE ASSET SALE\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement relating to the sale of our CSO business exposes us to contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Publicis, the purchaser of assets of our CSO business, for damages resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of ours in the Asset Purchase Agreement against any and all liabilities of ours not assumed by Publicis in the Asset Sale and for certain other matters. Significant indemnification claims by Publicis could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We will not be obligated to indemnify Publicis for any breach of certain of the representations and warranties by us under the Asset Purchase Agreement until the aggregate amount of claims for indemnification exceed $250,000. In the event that claims for indemnification exceed this threshold, we will be obligated to indemnify Publicis for any damages or loss resulting from such breach up to 25% of the total purchase price paid or due and payable by Publicis to us. Claims for indemnification for breaches of covenants made by us under the Asset Purchase Agreement and for breaches of representations and warranties classified as fundamental representations or any provision of the Asset Purchase Agreement relating to taxes will not be subject to the deductible or aggregate liability cap described above. The Asset Purchase Agreement also allows Publicis to withhold monies due against an earn-out payment if indemnification claims are asserted. In addition, under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we will retain all of our debts and liabilities not assumed by Publicis.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we breach the Asuragen License Agreement or the CPRIT License Agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and commercialization efforts for miRInform\u00ae thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nWe currently license certain patents and know-how from Asuragen relating to (i) miRInform\u00ae thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, or the Asuragen License Agreement, and (ii) the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer, or the CPRIT License Agreement. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae pancreas platform for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale. Under the CPRIT License Agreement, we are obligated to pay 5% of net sales on sales of certain diagnostic devices and the performance of services relating to thyroid cancer that incorporate technology developed and funded under an agreement between Asuragen and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, subject to a maximum deduction of 1.5% for royalties paid to third parties. Both of the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement continue until terminated by (i) mutual agreement of the parties or (ii) either party in the event of a material breach of the respective agreement by the other party. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under the CPRIT License Agreement, Asuragen will have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed patent rights relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights and other technology licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under these license agreements could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under these license agreements, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and commercialization efforts for miRInform\u00ae thyroid and pancreas cancer molecular diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of molecular diagnostic tests and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. While we apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in relevant jurisdictions. Others could seek to design around our current or future patented technologies. We may not be successful in defending any challenges made against our patents or patent applications. On January 16, 2018, we were notified that an Opposition had been filed against EP patent # 2772550 alleging that the patent is invalid. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents and increased competition to our business. The outcome of patent litigation can be uncertain and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nMonitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Further, competitors could willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that arguably fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or replicate any of our products and technologies. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect us against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our overall business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our molecular diagnostic tests.\nAs is the case with other molecular diagnostics companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents of molecular diagnostics tests, like our molecular diagnostic tests in our PancraGEN\u00ae and miRInform\u00ae platforms, involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. From time-to-time the U.S. Supreme Court, other Federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, on October 30, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision that methods or processes cannot be patented unless they are tied to a machine or involve a physical transformation. The U.S. Supreme Court later reversed that decision in Bilski v. Kappos, finding that the \u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not the only test for determining patent eligibility. The Court, however, declined to specify how and when processes are patentable. On March 30, 2012, in the case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\u2019s application of Bilski and invalidated a patent focused on a process for identifying a proper dosage for an existing therapeutic because the patent claim embodied a law of nature. On July 30, 2012, the USPTO released a memorandum entitled \u201c2012 Interim Procedure for Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis of Process Claims Involving Laws of Nature,\u201d with guidelines for determining patentability of diagnostic or other processes in line with the Mayo decision. On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, the Supreme Court held that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated. The Supreme Court did not address the patentability of any innovative method claims involving the manipulation of isolated genes. On March 4, 2014, the USPTO released a memorandum entitled \u201c2014 Procedure For Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products.\u201d This memorandum provides guidelines for the USPTO\u2019s new examination procedure for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 for claims embracing natural products or natural principles. On June 12, 2015, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Ariosa v. Sequenom holding that a method for detecting a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin performed on a maternal serum or plasma sample from a pregnant female were unpatentable as directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon. On July 30, 2015, the USPTO released a Federal Register Notice entitled, \u201cJuly 2015 Update on Subject Matter Eligibility,\u201d This Notice updated the USPTO guidelines for the USPTO\u2019s procedure for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 for claims embracing natural products or natural principles phenomenon. On May 4, 2016, the USPTO released life science examples that were intended to be used in conjunction with the USPTO guidance on subject matter eligibility. Although the guidelines and examples do not have the force of law, patent examiners have been instructed to follow them. What constitutes a law of nature and a sufficient inventive concept remains uncertain, and it is possible that certain aspects of molecular diagnostics tests would be considered natural laws and, therefore, ineligible for patent protection. Some aspects of our technology involve processes that may be subject to this evolving standard and we cannot guarantee that any of our pending or issued claims will be patentable or upheld as valid as a result of such evolving standards. In addition, patents we own or license that issued before these recent cases may be subject to challenge in court or before the USPTO in view of these current legal standards. Accordingly, the evolving interpretation and application of patent laws in the United States governing the eligibility of diagnostics for patent protection may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any owned and licensed patents. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations and application of patent laws may also diminish the value of our existing intellectual property or intellectual property that we continue to develop. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforceable in our patents or in third-party patents.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may be involved in litigation related to intellectual property, which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may receive notices of claims of direct or indirect infringement or misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights from time to time and some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assume that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or other rights, or the validity of our patents, trademarks or other rights, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. No assurance can be given that other patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications. If third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could incur significant costs and experience management distraction. Litigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patents and proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us, and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity, scope and coverage of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and ongoing royalties, and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling our products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. We could incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY\nWe will continue to incur increased costs and demands on management as a result of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, consulting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, and The NASDAQ Stock Market, impose a number of requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance and disclosure obligations. Moreover, these rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and make some activities more complex, time-consuming and costly. We also expect that it will continue to be expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND OUR COMMON STOCK\nIf we do not meet certain of NASDAQ continued listing requirements and therefore, we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our stockholders to trade our stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cIDXG.\u201d NASDAQ has adopted a number of listing standards that are applicable to our common stock for continued listing on NASDAQ. If we do not meet certain NASDAQ continued listing requirements we risk the possibility of delisting of our securities. Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and likely also on our business. Additionally, our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if our common stock was delisted from NASDAQ or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another U.S. national securities exchange. In order to retain our listing on NASDAQ, we are required by NASDAQ to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. In the event that our stock closes below the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for any 30 consecutive business days, we would not be incompliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements and our stock could be delisted from NASDAQ.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIn the event our stock is delisted there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain or maintain compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements, or that our common stock will not be delisted from NASDAQ in the future. If our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, it could lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, increased volatility in our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, could result in a loss of current or future coverage by certain sell-side analysts and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. Delisting could also cause a loss of confidence of our customers, collaborators, vendors, suppliers and employees, which could harm our business and future prospects.\nIf our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ in the future, our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, OTC QB or another over-the-counter market. Any such alternative would likely result in it being more difficult for us to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities and for investors to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that our common stock would be eligible for trading on any such alternative exchange or markets. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our securities and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial number of authorized common and preferred shares available for future issuance that could cause dilution of our stockholders\u2019 interest, adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have a total of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. As of March 1, 2018 we had 72,122,006 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance and we have reserved 1,629,077 shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding awards under our stock incentive plan, 2,976,438 additional shares available for future grants of awards under our stock incentive plan as well as warrants for 13,542,148 shares of our common stock outstanding at prices ranging from a $1.25 to $4.69 per warrant share. We may seek financing that could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock. We may also make acquisitions that result in issuances of additional shares of our capital stock. Those additional issuances of capital stock could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, the book value per share of our common stock may be reduced. This reduction would occur if the exercise price of any issued warrants, the conversion price of any convertible notes or the conversion ratio of any issued preferred stock is lower than the book value per share of our common stock at the time of such exercise or conversion. Additionally, new investors in any subsequent issuances of our securities could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of common stock.\nAny weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDuring 2016, management identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures, which were subsequently remedied in 2017; however, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Any such failure could adversely affect our ability to report financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could have other material effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Potential material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe have anti-takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws include provisions, such as providing for three classes of directors, which may make it more difficult to remove our directors and management and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which allows our Board to create one or more classes of preferred stock with rights and preferences greater than those afforded to the holders of our common stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a future takeover or a change in control, unless the takeover or change in control is approved by our Board. We are also subject to laws that may have a similar effect. For example, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. As a result of the foregoing, it will be difficult for another company to acquire us and, therefore, could limit the price that possible investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, the rights of our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future and in this offering.\nWe have not declared any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Future earnings, if any, will be used to finance the future operation and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We presently intend to retain all earnings for our operations. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may vary as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the commencement, delay, cancellation or completion of sales and marketing programs;\n\u25cf regulatory developments;\n\u25cf uncertainty about the realizable value of sales of our tests;\n\u25cf timing and amount of expenses for implementing new programs and accuracy of estimates of resources required for ongoing programs;\n\u25cf adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our tests;\n\u25cf timing and integration of any acquisitions; and\n\u25cf changes in regulations related to diagnostics, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies.\nWe believe that quarterly, and in certain instances annual, comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance especially with our adoption of ASC 606 effective beginning January 1, 2018 related to how we accrue revenues going forward. Fluctuations in quarterly and annual results could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long-term operating performance.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nOur stock price is volatile and could be further affected by events not within our control, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nDuring 2017, our common stock traded at a low of $0.72 and a high of $14.25. During 2016, our common stock traded at a low of $0.70 and a high of $19.80. The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to:\n\u25cf general volatility in the trading markets;\n\u25cf significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf significant changes in our cash and cash equivalent reserves;\n\u25cf announcements regarding our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements regarding our equity offerings;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf industry and/or regulatory developments;\n\u25cf changes in revenue mix;\n\u25cf changes in revenue and revenue growth rates for us and for the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u25cf statements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate.\nThe prices of our common stock listed above have been adjusted to reflect a one-for-ten reverse split on our issued and outstanding shares of common stock effected on December 28, 2016.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us, our business and our competitors. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions or financial models included in their reports. Securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our company, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could also decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nThe indemnification rights provided to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against its directors, officers, and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions permitting us to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, and employees. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 86083, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "IDXG"}
