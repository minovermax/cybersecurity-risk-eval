{"cik": "801898", "company": "JOY GLOBAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur international operations are subject to many uncertainties, and a significant reduction in international sales of our products could adversely affect us.\nOur international operations are subject to various economic, political and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 68%, 69% and 72% of our sales respectively were derived from sales outside the United States. Political and/or economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate may significantly affect our profitability and growth prospects. The following risks are associated with doing business internationally and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nregional or country specific economic downturns;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chilean peso, Chinese renminbi, Euro, and South African rand;\n\u2022\ncomplications in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to environmental and anti-corruption matters, which may adversely affect our operations and ability to compete effectively in certain jurisdictions or regions;\n\u2022\ncustoms matters and changes in trade policy, tariff regulations or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\neconomic or political instability or tensions, trade disputes and the introduction of economic sanctions;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and international or civil conflicts that affect international trade or the mining industry, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, up to and including nationalization or expropriation by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nhigher tax rates and potentially adverse tax changes, including restrictions on repatriating offshore earnings, adverse tax withholding requirements and double taxation;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of litigation and other disputes with customers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating performance based on our geographic mix of sales;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ncosts and difficulties in integrating, staffing and managing international operations, especially in emerging markets such as China;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and the greater difficulty in recovering from them in some of the foreign countries in which we operate, especially in countries prone to earthquakes, such as Chile, China, India and Indonesia; and\n\u2022\nuncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations.\nThe foregoing risks may be particularly acute in emerging markets, where our operations are subject to greater uncertainty due to increased volatility associated with the developing nature of the economic, legal and governmental systems of these countries. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is materially impacted by cyclical economic conditions affecting the global mining industry.\nChanges in economic conditions affecting the global mining industry can occur abruptly and unpredictably, which may have significant effects on our sales of original equipment and services. Cyclicality for original equipment sales is driven primarily by price volatility of the commodities that our equipment is used to mine, including coal, copper, iron ore and oil, or their substitutes, as well as product life cycles, competitive pressures and other economic factors affecting the mining industry, such as company consolidation and increased regulation and competition affecting demand for commodities, and the broader economy, including changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and from market expectations with respect to such policies. Falling commodity prices have in the past and may in the future lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers, reductions in the production levels of existing mines, a contraction in the number of existing mines and the closure of less efficient mines. Reduced capital expenditures and decreased mining activity by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in demand for new mining machinery, and may result in a decrease in demand for parts and services as our customers are likely to reduce utilization of equipment, reduce inventories, redistribute parts from closed mines and delay rebuilds and other maintenance during industry downturns. In addition to declining orders for our products and services, adverse economic conditions for our customers may make it more difficult for us to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect our working capital. As a result of this cyclicality in the global mining industry, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we expect our business to continue to be subject to these fluctuations in the future.\nA large portion of our business is dependent on there being continued demand for coal, which is subject to economic and climate related risks.\nApproximately 59% of our revenues come from our thermal and metallurgical coal-mining customers. Many of these customers supply coal for the generation of electricity and/or steel production. Demand for steel is affected by the global level of economic activity and economic growth. The pursuit of the most cost effective form of electricity generation continues to take place throughout the world and coal-fired electricity generation faces intense price competition from other fuel sources, particularly natural gas. In addition, coal combustion typically generates significant greenhouse gas emissions and governmental and private sector goals and mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may increasingly affect the mix of electricity generation sources. Further developments in connection with legislation, regulations, international agreements or other limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts or costs from coal combustion, both in the United States and in other countries, could diminish demand for coal as a fuel for electricity generation. If lower greenhouse gas emitting forms of electricity generation, such as nuclear, solar, natural gas or wind power, become more prevalent or cost effective, or diminished economic activity reduces demand for steel, demand for coal will decline. Reduced demand for coal would result in reduced demand for our mining equipment and services and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulations impacting the mining industry may adversely affect demand for our products.\nWe supply original equipment and services to mining companies operating in major mining regions throughout the world. Our customers\u2019 operations are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, including those directly impacting mining activities and those indirectly affecting their businesses, such as applicable environmental laws. In addition, new environmental legislation or administrative regulations relating to mining or affecting demand for mined materials, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2015 regulations imposing new carbon pollution standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require our customers to significantly change or curtail their operations. The high cost of compliance with environmental regulations may discourage our customers from expanding existing mines or developing new mines and may also cause customers to limit or even discontinue their mining operations. As a result of these factors, demand for our mining equipment and the services we provide could be adversely affected by environmental regulations directly or indirectly impacting the mining industry. Any reduction in demand for our products and services as a result of environmental regulations is likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDemand for our products may be adversely impacted by regulations related to mine safety.\nOur principal customers are surface and underground mining companies. The mining industry has encountered increased scrutiny as it relates to safety regulations, primarily due to high profile mining accidents. New legislation or regulations relating to mine safety standards and the increased cost of compliance with such standards may induce customers to discontinue or limit their mining operations and may discourage companies from developing new mines or maintaining existing mines, which in turn could diminish demand for our products and services.\nWe face risks from changes in government monetary policies that affect interest rates.\nMost countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for mined products, which in turn affects sales of our mining equipment and services. Interest rate changes also affect our customers\u2019 ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations because our international operations are conducted in various local currencies, while our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars.\nMost of our significant foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. Because our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we translate the assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues of these subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we conduct business, notably including the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chilean peso, Chinese renminbi and South African rand, may affect the value of our assets, earnings and cash flows. In addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the comparative prices between products we sell and products our foreign competitors sell in the same market, which may adversely affect demand for our equipment. Substantial exchange rate fluctuations, particularly due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as the comparability of our consolidated financial statements between reporting periods. While we attempt to reduce the risks from exchange rate fluctuations by entering into\nhedging arrangements, these arrangements may not be effective or may only delay or temporarily mitigate the adverse effect of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, litigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and may result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\nOur domestic and foreign manufacturing and service operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. We compete globally on the basis of product performance, customer service and support, availability, reliability, productivity and price. Most of our customers are large global mining companies that have substantial bargaining power, and some of our sales require us to participate in competitive bidding. We compete directly and indirectly with other manufacturers of surface and underground mining equipment and with manufacturers of parts and components for such products. Some of our competitors are larger than us and, as a result, may have broader product offerings and greater access to financial resources. Certain of our competitors also may pursue aggressive pricing or product strategies that may cause us to reduce the prices we charge for our original equipment, products and services or lose sales. These actions may lead to reduced revenues, lower margins and/or a decline in market share, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. We evaluate our finite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. Our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results. After performing our evaluation for impairment, we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the reporting unit or underlying asset exceeds its fair value. As there were triggering events at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015, an interim impairment test was performed, which was finalized and updated in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements. This impairment test resulted in such a conclusion and we recorded Underground impairment charges of $42.6 million, $57.9 million, $10.8 million, $1.2 billion and $6.3 million and for property, plant and equipment, customer relationships, trademarks, goodwill and other items, respectively. In addition, we recorded Surface impairment charges of $19.2 million and $2.1 million for property, plant and equipment and customer relationships, respectively. Because of the continued significance of our goodwill and other long-lived assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. With the continued deterioration of the global commodities markets, the Company remains at risk for further goodwill impairments. Although we have concluded there is no impairment on the goodwill of $354.6 million associated with our Surface segment as of year end, we will continue to closely monitor in the future considering the uncertainty in the markets and the continued decline in our stock price after year end. Should there be still further market declines and/or stock price declines in future periods, there is increasing risk that Surface segment goodwill may be impaired. We will continue to update our evaluation as market conditions and the follow on impacts to our expected future performance and share price warrant.\nWe may acquire businesses, dispose of businesses or engage in other transactions for which we may not realize anticipated benefits, or it may take longer than expected to realize such benefits, which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.\nFrom time to time, we may explore and pursue transaction opportunities that may complement our core businesses, and we also may consider divesting businesses or assets that we do not regard as part of our core businesses. These transaction opportunities may come in the form of acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, start-ups, divestitures or other structures. There are risks associated with acquisition and disposition of business transactions, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration risk, technology risk, market acceptance risk, litigation risk, environmental risk, regulatory approval risk and risks associated with the failure to complete announced transactions. In the case of acquisitions, we may not be able to discover, during the due diligence process or otherwise, all known and unknown risks associated with the business we are acquiring. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for known or unknown liabilities arising from the businesses we are divesting.\nUndiscovered factors may result in our incurring financial or other liabilities, which could be material. In addition, completion of a transaction may require us to incur debt, issue equity, utilize other capital resources, make expenditures, provide guarantees or indemnification and/or agree to other terms and may also consume a substantial portion of our management\u2019s time and attention. These transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders, and may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may acquire companies or make investments or otherwise enter into new markets in which we have little or no experience, which may lead us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such entry and which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we may acquire or make investments in companies or businesses to gain access to, or otherwise seek to enter, new product or geographic markets in which we have no, or only limited, familiarity and experience. In addition, we may acquire companies engaged in the manufacture of mining equipment that have substantial operations in other lines of business in which we have no prior experience, that we may be unwilling, or unable on commercially reasonable terms, to divest, or for which we may incur significant costs to divest. Our recent acquisition activity has included transactions of both types, including our 2014 and 2015 purchases of MTI and Montabert, respectively, through which we expanded our product lines to begin to compete in the market for underground hard rock mining equipment. While our entry into new markets may in many cases involve operations that appear complementary to our own, we may lack familiarity with the design, manufacture, sale or maintenance of equipment produced for this market, with the needs or expectations of customers operating in these markets, or with regulatory requirements affecting these markets. In addition, our competitors in new markets will have greater experience and may have greater resources than we do. As a result of these factors, we may fail to achieve the business objectives that we intended to achieve at the time we acquired or invested in a company or entered into a new market, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and may expose us to substantial liability if we fail to comply.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air (including greenhouse gas) emissions, water discharges, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination and the generation, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our various prior and future acquisitions and divestitures may have resulted or could result in environmental liabilities unknown to us at the time of acquisition or divestiture or other additional environmental liabilities.\nMoreover, environmental laws and regulations, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Future environmental laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. For example, increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or product demand.\nWe require cash to service our indebtedness, which reduces the cash available to finance our business, and the terms of our debt agreements require us to comply with financial and other covenants.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness depends on our financial performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. There is no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions\ndeteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments.\nOur existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses and impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding under one or more of the agreements being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on July 29, 2019 (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and our ability and the terms under which we may access the capital markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics, such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength, business and financial risk, industry conditions, transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. Our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. However, there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results, by our market outlook or by actions that we take, such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program. A downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the Credit Agreement as well as our cost of operations, negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms, or at all, negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in our actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates and other factors could affect our results of operations, equity and pension funding requirements in future periods.\nOur results of operations may be affected by the amount of income or expense that we record for our defined benefit pension plans and certain other retirement benefits. We measure the valuation of our pension plans annually as of our fiscal year end in order to determine the funded status of and our funding obligation with respect to such plans. This annual valuation of our pension plans is highly dependent on certain assumptions used in actuarial valuations, which include actual and expected return on pension assets, mortality, and discount rates. These assumptions take into account current and expected financial market data, other economic conditions, such as interest rates and inflation, and other factors such as plan asset allocation, mortality tables, and future salary increases. If actual rates of return of return on pension assets materially differ from assumptions, our pension funding obligations may increase or decrease significantly. The Company\u2019s accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. Our funding obligation is determined under governmental regulations and is measured based on the value of our assets and liabilities. An adverse change in our funded status due to the volatility of returns on pension assets and the discount rate applied could increase our required future contributions to our plans, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent on the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In addition, as of October 30, 2015, our foreign subsidiaries held $98.8 million of cash and cash equivalents that would be subject to U.S. taxation if repatriated to the United States. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, which cannot be assured.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements and trade secret law and, to a lesser extent, trademark and patent law, to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on third party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price increases.\nIn the manufacture of our products we use large amounts of raw materials and processed inputs including steel, copper and engine and electronic components. We obtain raw materials and certain manufactured components from third party suppliers. Our financial performance is constrained by our ability to secure critical raw materials such as steel and copper at prices that support our cost structure, or that can be passed along to our customers through increases in the price of the equipment that we manufacture. To reduce material costs and inventories, we rely on supplier arrangements with preferred vendors as a source for \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery of many raw materials and manufactured components. Because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers, including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies or other natural disasters, may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our customers on a timely basis and thereby affect our financial performance. If we are not able to pass raw material or component price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLabor disputes and increasing labor costs could adversely affect us.\nMany of our principal domestic and foreign operating subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with their employees. As of October 30, 2015, collective bargaining agreements or similar type arrangements cover 27% of our U.S. workforce and 28% of our international employees. We cannot provide assurance that disputes, work stoppages or strikes will not arise in the future. In addition, when existing collective bargaining agreements expire, we cannot be certain that we will be able to reach new agreements with our employees. In fiscal 2016, union agreements are to expire for 5% of our employees, with the largest agreements covering our Local 1114 union at our Milwaukee, Wisconsin facility and our Montabert union at our Lyon, France facility. New collective bargaining agreements may be on substantially different terms and may result in increased direct and indirect labor costs. Future disputes with our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased IT security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems and networks in connection with a variety of our business activities, and we collect and store sensitive data. IT security threats and sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, are increasing in sophistication and frequency. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We have experienced, and expect to continue to confront attempts from hackers and other third parties to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems and networks. Although these attacks to date have not had a material impact on us, we could in the future experience attacks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage IT risks within our control, we can provide no assurance that our actions will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks and data. A failure of or breach in IT security could expose us and our customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. Any of these events in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nA material disruption to one of our significant manufacturing plants could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe produce most of our original equipment and parts for each product type at a limited number of principal manufacturing facilities. If operations at one or more of these significant facilities were to be disrupted as a result of equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages or other reasons, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production could increase costs and delay delivery of some units.\nOur business could be adversely affected by our failure to develop new technologies.\nThe mining industry is a capital-intensive business, with extensive planning and development necessary to open a new mine. The success of our customers\u2019 mining projects is largely dependent on the efficiency with which the mine operates. If we are\nunable to provide continued technological improvements in our equipment that meet the needs and expectations of our customers and the broader industry on mine productivity, safety and efficiency, the demand for our mining equipment would be adversely affected, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, our growth may be hindered.\nOur ability to provide high quality products and services depends in part on our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel in the areas of senior management, product engineering, manufacturing, servicing and sales. Competition for such personnel is intense and our competitors and others can be expected to attempt to hire our skilled employees from time to time. In particular, our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain customer relationships and technical expertise provided by our management team and our professional personnel.\nWe rely on significant customers, the loss of one or more of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.\nWe are dependent on maintaining significant customers by delivering reliable, high performance mining equipment and other products on a timely basis. We do not consider ourselves to be dependent on any single customer; however, our top ten customers collectively accounted for approximately 37% of our net sales for fiscal 2015. Consolidation and divestitures in the mining industry may result in different equipment preferences among current and former significant customers. The loss of one or more of our significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, as required by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rule requires us to perform due diligence, and report whether \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, necessary to the functionality of a product we manufacture originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Since 2014 we have been required to file with the SEC on an annual basis a specialized disclosure report on Form SD regarding such matters. We also may become subject to similar regulatory initiatives in other jurisdictions. As our supply chain is complex, we may incur significant costs to determine the source and custody of conflict minerals that we use in order to comply with these regulatory requirements. We may also face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our equipment, or if we are unable to conclude that our products are \u201cconflict free.\u201d Over time, conflict minerals reporting requirements may affect the sourcing, price and availability of some minerals which are necessary to the manufacture of our products, and may affect the availability and price of conflict minerals that are certified as conflict free. Accordingly, we may incur significant costs as a consequence of regulations related to conflict-free minerals, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by litigation or contractual obligations that give rise to liability.\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in various unresolved legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of operations, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos and silica related liability), employment and commercial matters. We and our subsidiaries also become involved from time to time in proceedings relating to environmental matters and litigation arising outside the ordinary course of business. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain risks, our policies are subject to substantial deductibles. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate or that our policies will cover any particular loss. Insurance can be expensive, and we may not always be able to purchase insurance on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance (or for which our insurers refuse to provide coverage) or that result in recoveries in excess of insurance coverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us, as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Developments during the course of legal proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of our contingencies, which in turn may require us to record or change the amount of a reserve, or make a payment that is different than the amount that we have reserved. Changes to reserves and payments that are greater than reserved amounts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as a normal part of operations, our subsidiaries undertake contractual obligations, warranties and guarantees in connection with the sale of products or services. Some of these claims and obligations involve significant potential liability, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are the subject of an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management\u2019s attention and result in substantial investigation expenses, monetary fines and other possible remedies.\nWe disclosed on November 6, 2014 that we had received a subpoena from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement concerning our 2012 acquisition of International Mining Machinery Holdings Limited and related accounting matters. We are cooperating with the SEC regarding this investigation, which is ongoing. Responding to the SEC\u2019s investigation could divert management\u2019s attention from other matters relating to our business, result in substantial investigation expenses and otherwise harm our business and reputation. In addition, if the SEC were to commence legal action, we could be subject to monetary fines and other possible remedies. We are unable to predict what consequences, if any, the SEC investigation may have on us, or the timing of its resolution. Although we currently do not expect the investigation to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity, the timing, resolution and impact of this matter is unknown.", "PERMNO": 89105, "SIC": 3532, "TIC": "JOY"}
