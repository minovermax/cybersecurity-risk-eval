{"cik": "1735707", "company": "Garrett Motion Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business:\nRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials (including, but not limited to, grey iron, aluminum, stainless steel as well as a nickel, iron and chromium-based alloy) are key elements in the cost of our products. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed-price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single- or sole-source basis. Although we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. For example, in 2021, the global automotive market experienced shortages in the supply of semiconductors due to global supply constraints, resulting in reduced automobile production volumes, which had a knock-on effect on demand for Garrett\u2019s products. Such semiconductor shortages are expected to continue in the future and could affect Garrett\u2019s supply of components, as well as continue to affect demand for Garrett\u2019s products. Short- or long-term capacity constraints or financial distress at any point in our supply chain could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial performance, particularly when the affected suppliers and vendors are the sole sources of products that we require or that have unique capabilities, or when our customers have directed us to use those specific suppliers and vendors. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial contracts, and could result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Our business also uses substantial amounts of energy in production, and our production activities may therefore be impacted by power outages in the places where we produce our products, such as China (Jiangsu province in particular). As of December 31, 2021, Garrett plants in China have not experienced power outage impacts at our own production facilities. However, reduced supplier capacity may not meet our demands, and we may also encounter demand reduction from customers or power cuts in our own plants going forward. Any power outage impacts are closely monitored.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, the global economy has experienced an increased risk of shortages and other disruptions to global supply chains, including as a result of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such shortages and other disruptions to global supply chains may have an adverse impact on the cost and availability of raw materials, components, energy and other inputs used in our business, or in the businesses of our customers and suppliers, and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nWe are exposed to a broad range of climate-related risks arising from both the non-physical and physical impacts of climate change and related risks, including actions by governments in response to such risks, which may materially affect demand for our products, our supply chain, and our results of operations\nThe sales and margins of our business are directly impacted by government regulations, including safety, performance and product certification regulations, particularly with respect to emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. While such requirements can promote increased demand for our turbochargers and other products, several markets in which we operate are undertaking efforts to more strictly regulate or ban vehicles powered by certain older-generation diesel engines. If such efforts are pursued more broadly throughout the market than we have anticipated, such efforts may impact demand for our aftermarket products. Changes in demand and emerging needs of customers that are not perceived adequately in advance and/or incorporated in the product development process (e.g., demand for eco-compatible products) may result in lower sales volumes and consequently affect our results of operations.\nCertain markets in which we operate are also contemplating or undertaking multi-decade efforts to transition away from internal combustion engines in favor of hybrid or full-battery electric vehicles. For example, in Europe, in July 2021 the European Commission released its legislation package in connection with its commitment to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, which identified electrification as the main instrument to reduce emissions in the road transport sector, and greenhouse gas emission standards for cars and vans is expected to result in a de facto ban on internal combustion engines by 2035. In the United States, in August 2021 the EPA proposed to revise existing national greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2023-2026, while the President signed an executive order with the goal of making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles. There is not yet a legislative framework in China, but we expect China to adopt similar proposals to Europe and the United States in the coming years.\nIf a transition to battery-electric vehicles is pursued more broadly throughout the market, is implemented more rapidly than we have anticipated, or if we overestimate the turbocharger penetration rate in hybrids, then the demand for our products could be impacted and our results of operations consequently could be affected.\nChanging government regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency and growing recognition among consumers of the dangers of climate change may also require changes at the product/production process level.\nThese trends may also prompt automotive OEMs to make commitments to carbon neutrality, which could in turn prompt us to make changes at the product/production process level. This could require additional cost/investment to make products/production processes compliant and/or carbon neutral.\nIn addition to legislation and regulations, and business trends, the physical impacts of climate change present an area of risk. Floods, seismic events, other natural disasters or natural events causing damage threaten the functioning and/or continuity of the Company and its suppliers. For example, in late July 2021, typhoon \u201cFireworks\u201d resulted in disruption to our operations at our plant in Shanghai and in November 2021, high winds at the Cheadle site caused a part of a building\u2019s roof to break off. In order to mitigate these risks, the Company develops and executes emergency responses plans in anticipation of potential significant weather events. Despite these mitigation efforts, such climate-related natural events are unpredictable, and may cause damage to operating assets/property in use, interruption or reduction in capability of production/processes, and/or product inventories, which could result in additional costs for recovery and/or lost sales. Such events can also increase the risk of interruption or increasing costs due to the impacts of climate change on utility providers.\nIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which, in turn, can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. A substantial portion of our customers are OEMs in the automotive industry. This industry is subject to rapid technological change often driven by regulatory changes, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns. In addition to general economic conditions, automotive sales and automotive vehicle production also depend on other factors, such as supplier stability, factory transitions, capacity constraints, the costs and availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer preferences. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products. Economic declines and corresponding reductions in automotive sales and production by our customers, particularly with respect to light vehicles, have in the past had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, in 2021, the global automotive market experienced shortages in the supply of semiconductors due to global supply constraints, resulting in reduced automobile production volumes, which had a knock-on effect on demand for Garrett\u2019s products from our customers. Such semiconductor shortages are expected to continue in the future and could continue to affect Garrett\u2019s supply of components, as well as continue to negatively impact demand for Garrett\u2019s products.\nEven if overall automotive sales and production remain stable, changes in regulations and consumer preferences may shift consumer demand away from the types of vehicles we prioritize or towards the types of vehicles where our products generate smaller profit margins. A decrease in consumer demand for the specific types of vehicles that have traditionally included our turbocharger products, such as a decrease in demand for diesel-fueled vehicles in favor of gasoline-fueled vehicles, or lower-than-expected consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we anticipate providing significant components as part of our strategic growth plan, such as a decrease in demand for vehicles utilizing electric-hybrid and fuel cell powertrains in favor of full battery electric vehicles, could have a significant effect on our business. If we are unable to anticipate significant changes in consumer sentiment, or if consumer demand for certain vehicle types changes more than we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSales in our aftermarket operations are also directly related to consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products, which may be affected by additional factors such as the average useful life of OEM parts and components, severity of regional weather conditions, highway and roadway infrastructure deterioration and the average number of miles vehicles are driven by owners. Improvements in technology and product quality are extending the longevity of vehicle component parts, which may result in delayed or reduced aftermarket sales. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to changes in the demand for our aftermarket products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nDuring 2020, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, spread across the world, including throughout Asia, the United States and Europe. The outbreak and government measures taken in response had and continue to have a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our businesses and the economy. Our manufacturing facility in Wuhan, China was shut down for six weeks in February and March 2020 and we saw diminished production in our Shanghai, China facility for that same time period, which were the primary drivers of the decrease in sales in the Asia region during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2020. While our facilities in China re-opened in the second quarter of 2020, our manufacturing facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and Pune, India were shut down and our manufacturing facilities in Europe operated at reduced capacity. This significantly reduced our production volumes and had a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the third quarter of 2020, the fast recovery observed in all geographies enabled us to ramp up production in most of our production sites to normal levels. This recovery continued in the fourth quarter of 2020 with a very strong demand especially in China and Europe. However, if the COVID-19 pandemic drives new lockdown measures impacting our manufacturing facilities, our facilities may be forced to shut down or operate at reduced capacity again which will continue to negatively impact our revenues. We have also faced limitations on our employee resources, including because of stay-at-home orders from local governments, new paid time off policies, employee furloughs, state-funded layoffs, sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. The pandemic has also diverted management resources and the prolonged work-from-home arrangements have created or exacerbated business continuity and cybersecurity risks.\nCertain of our customers have been similarly affected and are experiencing closures and labor shortages. As a result of such closures, we have experienced weakened demand from our customers, who have not been able to accept orders or have delayed or canceled orders, which has negatively affected our revenues. If this trend continues, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the availability and effectiveness of vaccines or treatments, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the European Union, China and other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the disease. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions beyond current expectations, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially and adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected.\nOur sales were adversely affected in the fiscal year 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, however we observed a fast recovery in all geographies since mid-2020. The direct adverse impact on our financial performance began to dissipate over the course of fiscal year 2021. All our facilities are fully operational since the third quarter of 2020. Although we remain optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, there is continued uncertainty related to variant strains that can have direct or indirect repercussions on our operations and ultimately financial performance which cannot be estimated at this time.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property of others could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available, or we may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate registered or unregistered intellectual property, in every country in which we do business. Furthermore, in some areas of our business the established industry maturity of product technology may leave limited opportunity for new intellectual property to differentiate our products. Accordingly, our intellectual property may not be sufficient on its own to provide us a strong product differentiation and competitive advantage, which in turn could weaken our ability to secure business awards from our customers and/or our ability to achieve targeted product profitability.\nThe protection of our intellectual property may require us to spend significant amounts of money. Further, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent others from infringing, violating or misappropriating our intellectual proprietary rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational technical export control regulations and trade conflicts may limit our ability to use certain intellectual property in our products in some regions of the world or customers may require assured access to intellectual property through open source-code, joint ownership of intellectual property, free license, or other measures. These constraints could cause us difficulty in securing business awards from our customers, protecting our competitive technology differentiation, and/or our ability to achieve targeted product profitability.\nIn addition, as we adopt new technology, we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights. Successful claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of\nothers could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or cause us to incur substantial monetary liability. We may also be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or be required to change our business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. In addition, our customer agreements may require us to indemnify the customer for infringement. The time and expense of defending against these claims, whether meritorious or not, may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability, can be time-consuming and costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Furthermore, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our existing customer relationships and our ability to develop new business.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims, including product recalls, and product liability actions that may be brought against us.\nDepending on the terms under which we supply products to an auto manufacturer, we may be required to guarantee or offer warranties for our products and to bear the costs of recalls, repair or replacement of such products pursuant to new vehicle warranties. There can be no assurance that we will have adequate reserves to cover such recall, repair and replacement costs. In the event that any of our products fails to perform as expected, we may face direct exposure to warranty and product liability claims or may be required to participate in a government or self-imposed recall involving such products. Our customers that are not end users, such as auto manufacturers, may face similar claims or be obliged to conduct recalls of their own, and in such circumstances, they may seek contribution from us. Our agreements with our customers do not always include limitation of liability clauses or, in certain situations or legal jurisdictions, such limitation of liability clauses may not be fully valid. If any such claims or contribution requests exceed our available insurance, or if there is a product recall, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have a further adverse impact on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.\nThe operational constraints and financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third-party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver products, parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders on similar terms or at all, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. See \u201cRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\u201d If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness and operational reliability of existing or future suppliers, if there is any unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and operational reliability, or if our suppliers do not perform or adhere to our existing or future contractual arrangements, any resulting increase in nonperformance by them, our inability to otherwise obtain the supplies or our inability to enforce the terms of the contract or seek other remedies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWork stoppages, other disruptions, or the need to relocate any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our business.\nOur geographic footprint emphasizes locating, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers, thereby enabling us to adopt technologies and products for the specific vehicle types sold in each geographic market. Because our facilities offer localized services in this manner, a work stoppage or other disruption at one or more of our R&D, engineering or manufacturing and assembly facilities in a given region could have material adverse effects on our business, especially insofar as it impacts our ability to serve customers in that region. For example, our manufacturing facility in Wuhan, China was shut down in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, causing us to delay certain shipments to our customers. Moreover, due to unforeseen circumstances or factors beyond our control, we may be forced to relocate our operations from one or more of our existing facilities to new facilities and may incur substantial costs, experience program delays and sacrifice proximity to customers and geographic markets as a result, potentially for an extended period of time.\nThe automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, and when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations, we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the \u201croot cause\u201d problem as well as expeditiously\nproducing replacement components or products. We typically must also carry the costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight. Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. These losses and expenses could be significant, and may include consequential losses such as lost profits.\nIn addition, a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or other disruption at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could impact our ability to make timely deliveries to our customers and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time, or as a result of a work stoppage or other disruption, it is unlikely we will be fully compensated, if at all.\nWe may not realize sales represented by awarded business or effectively utilize our manufacturing capacity.\nWhen we win a bid to offer products and services to an OEM customer, the customer typically does not commit to award us its business until a separate contract has been negotiated, generally with a term ranging from one year to the life of the model (usually three to seven years). Once business has been awarded, the OEM customer typically retains the ability to terminate the arrangement without penalty and does not commit to purchase a minimum volume of products while the contract is in effect.\nIn light of the foregoing, while we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions, including projected future sales volumes, the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers\u2019 products; our customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory; design changes; changes in our customers\u2019 manufacturing strategy; the success of customers\u2019 goods and models; and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers. A significant decrease in demand for certain key models or a group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or the ability of a manufacturer to re-source and discontinue purchasing from us its requirements for a particular model or group of models, could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, we may be unable to forecast the level of customer orders with sufficient certainty to allow us to optimize production schedules and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. Any excess capacity would cause us to incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during economic downturns. Similarly, a significant failure or inability to adapt to increased production or desired inventory levels (including as a result of accelerated launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms), comply with customer specifications and manufacturing requirements more generally or respond to other unexpected fluctuations, as well as any delays or other problems with existing or new products (including program launch difficulties) could result in financial penalties, increased costs, loss of sales, loss of customers or potential breaches of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nIf actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business, or if we are unable to improve utilization levels for manufacturing lines that consequently are underutilized and correctly manage capacity, the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate.\nWe may not be able to successfully negotiate pricing terms with our customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe negotiate sales prices annually with our automotive customers. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the period of production. In addition, our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts at any time, which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions. OEMs have also exercised significant influence over their suppliers, including us, because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive and serves a limited number of customers. Based on these factors, our status as a Tier I supplier (one that supplies vehicle components directly to manufacturers) and the fact that our customers\u2019 product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes, our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing, and any cost-cutting initiatives that our customers adopt generally will result in increased downward pressure on our pricing. Any resulting impacts to our sales levels and margins, could over time significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Additionally, large commercial settlements with our customers may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.\nWe have created a geographic footprint that emphasizes locating R&D, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers. Our international geographic footprint subjects us to many risks, including: exchange control regulations; wage and price controls; antitrust and environmental regulations; employment regulations; foreign investment laws; monetary and fiscal policies and protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, establish local content requirements, or impact trade volumes; import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes); violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws; changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises; nationalization of private enterprises; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses; global health risks and pandemics; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions; violence, civil and labor unrest; acts of terrorism; and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Additionally, certain of the markets in which we operate have adopted increasingly strict data privacy and data protection requirements or may require local storage and processing of data or similar requirements. The European Commission has approved a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), that came into force in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The GDPR and similar data protection measures may increase the cost and complexity of our ability to deliver our services to ensure compliance.\nFollowing the United Kingdom's (\"U.K.\") withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the U.K. entered into a transition period during which it continued its ongoing and complex negotiations with the European Union relating to the future trading relationship between the U.K. and European Union. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, before which the United Kingdom and the European Commission reached a cooperation agreement on the future trading relationship between the parties (the \u201cTCA\u201d). On December 30, 2020 the U.K. Parliament approved the European (Future Relationship) Bill, thereby ratifying the TCA. The TCA was formally approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on May 1, 2021. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before withdrawal. Our manufacturing operations in Cheadle and the businesses of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted if tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on the free flow of goods to and from the U.K.\nTrade tensions between the United States and China, and other countries have escalated in recent years. Any U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports have generally been followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. We may not be able to mitigate the impacts of any future tariffs, and our business, results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected by such tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These and other instabilities and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, along with the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\nAs a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar whereas a significant amount of our payment obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange risk. We monitor and seek to reduce such risk through hedging activities; however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility.\nFinally, we generate significant cash that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose us to financial loss.\nWe have invested substantial resources in specific foreign markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized.\nWe have identified certain countries, such as China and India, as key high-growth geographic markets. We believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long-term growth, and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in numerous manufacturing operations, technical centers, R&D activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas. If market demand for evolving vehicle technologies in these regions does not grow as quickly as we anticipate, or if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions, we may fail to realize expected rates of return, or even incur losses, on our existing investments and may be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product\ncategories, potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors. In particular, our ability to remain competitive and continue to grow in these regions depends in part on the absence of competing state-sponsored domestic businesses. If a state-sponsored operation entered a local market as a competitor, it might have access to significant social and financial capital that would enable it to overcome the ordinary barriers to entry in the turbocharger industry and acquire potentially significant market share at our expense.\nWe could be adversely affected by our leading market position in certain markets.\nWe believe that we are a market leader in the turbocharger industry in many of the markets in which we operate. Although we believe we have acted properly in the markets in which we have significant market share, we could face allegations of abuse of our market position or of collusion with other market participants, which could result in negative publicity and adverse regulatory action by the relevant authorities, including the imposition of monetary fines, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA deterioration in industry, economic or financial conditions may restrict our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations, and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and R&D projects and the status and timing of these developments. If our access to capital were to become constrained significantly, or if costs of capital increased significantly, due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the solvency of our customers, a material decline in demand for our products, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain targeted credit ratings.\nWe may need additional capital resources in the future in order to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business.\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, workforce reductions, asset impairments, product line rationalizations and other cost-saving initiatives. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the investigation and cleanup of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may arise from hazardous substance releases and exposures. We are also subject to potentially material liabilities related to the compliance of our operations with the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign governments that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. If we are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to substantial fines and criminal sanctions and be required to install costly equipment or make operational changes to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations or government enforcement of policies concerning the environment, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new information related to individual contaminated sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up\nrequirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur additional currently unanticipated costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.\nWe are currently, and we may in the future, be party to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of our current and historical business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters, as well as securities litigation, tax proceedings and litigation related to our debt. For additional information regarding our pending legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of legal proceedings or contingencies. The costs incurred in litigation can be substantial and result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may also make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If we were required to make payments, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the complex nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel, scientists and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of our future earnings which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nChanges in interest rates and cessation of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") could adversely affect our earnings and/or cash flows.\nBecause a significant number of our loans are made at variable interest rates, our business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans extended to us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms will cause LIBOR to cease to exist and will cause the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s). The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S.\ndollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. In January 2022, we amended our Credit Agreement (as defined below) to, among other things, remove LIBOR as an available rate at which revolving loans could accrue and add for such revolving loans new benchmark rate options based on the term or daily overnight secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\") published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based on the average bid reference rate administered by ASX Benchmarks Pty Limited. The outstanding term loan under the Credit Agreement continues to accrue interest in LIBOR, but will switch to an alternative benchmark rate when certain events occur, which alternative benchmark we anticipate will be term SOFR. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for, or value of, LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nWe manage interest rate risks with a variety of techniques that include the selective use of derivatives. When LIBOR ceases to exist or ceases to be the variable rate used under our Credit Agreement as a benchmark to establish the interest rate, there is no assurance that the interest rate on our interest rate swaps will conform to the new interest rate under our Credit Agreement. There can further be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. If the replacement rate for LIBOR in our interest rate swaps differs from the replacement rate for LIBOR under our Credit Agreement, our interest rate swaps may be ineffective and require us to mark-to-market the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap through our income statement. Accordingly, if any of the derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective, it may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.\nBecause we have officers and directors who live outside of the United States, you may have no effective recourse against them for misconduct and may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of your investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers.\nWe have officers and directors who live outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the U.S. any judgments obtained against those officers and directors or obtain judgments against them outside of the U.S. that are based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the U.S. Investors may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of their investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers.\nOur emerging opportunities in technology, products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nA number of our emerging opportunities in technology, products and services rely on key technologies developed or licensed from third parties. While the majority of our current product offerings are not covered by third-party licenses, many of our emerging technology offerings that we are developing use software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including both through proprietary and open source licenses. Should such emerging products become a significant part of our product offerings, our reliance on third-party licenses may present various risks to our business. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our emerging technology offerings, our relationship with these third parties may deteriorate, or our agreements with these third parties may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available for use in the future on terms that may be acceptable or that allow our emerging product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our emerging technology offerings. Moreover, it is possible that as a consequence of a future merger or acquisition we may be involved in, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to obtain these rights.\nCertain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in Honeywell.\nBecause of their former positions with Honeywell, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in Honeywell. Continuing ownership of Honeywell shares could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and Honeywell face decisions that could have implications for both us and Honeywell.\nThe allocation of intellectual property rights between Honeywell and us as part of the Spin-Off, and our shared use of certain intellectual property rights, could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into agreements with Honeywell governing the allocation of intellectual property rights related to our business. These agreements could adversely affect our position and options relating to intellectual property enforcement, licensing negotiations and monetization. We also may not have sufficient rights to grant sublicenses of intellectual property used in our business. These circumstances could adversely affect our ability to protect our competitive position in the industry.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. If we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner.\nWe are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn the course of preparing our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, management identified a material error in the calculation of earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our management determined that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed at that time related to a deficiency in the design and implementation of effective controls relating to involvement of subject matter experts in management's review of complex and bespoke transactions. As a result of such material weakness, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021 and have taken certain remediation steps with respect to the material weakness as set out in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate our material weakness, or in the event that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our ability to accurately record, process and report financial information and consequently, our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be unable to maintain compliance with the federal securities laws and NYSE listing requirements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports.\nOur ability to successfully comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may provide an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, the market price of shares of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting, which could have a negative effect on the market price of the market price of shares of our Common Stock and our Series A Preferred Stock, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our business and relationships with vendors, suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022key suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022the ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022the ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022employees may be distracted from the performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection and the Chapter 11 Cases will not adversely affect our future results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy protection may not be comparable to our historical financial information.\nWe emerged from bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 30, 2021. As a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our future results of operations, financial condition and business may not be comparable to the results of operations, financial condition and business reflected in our historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our securities.\nOur actual financial results may vary significantly from the projections that were filed with the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn connection with our disclosure statement relating to the Plan (the \u201cDisclosure Statement\u201d), and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. This projected financial information was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management. Our auditors, Deloitte SA, neither examined, compiled nor performed any procedures with respect to the projected financial information and, accordingly, Deloitte SA has expressed no opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Those projections were prepared solely for the Chapter 11 Cases and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis. Those projections should not be relied upon in connection with the purchase or sale of the Common Stock or the Series A Preferred Stock. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance and with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections that were prepared in connection with the Disclosure Statement and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of our Board changed significantly upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Our Board is now made up of nine directors, comprising three directors designated by certain affiliated funds of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (the \"Centerbridge Investors\"), three directors designated by certain affiliated funds of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (the \"Oaktree Investors\"), one director elected by Honeywell, one director designated by additional investors (the \"Additional Investors\") party to that certain investor rights agreement entered into with certain holders of our Series A Preferred Stock in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy (the \"Investor Rights Agreement\") and one director that is a member of our executive management team. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement for the Series A Preferred Stock, the Centerbridge Investors and the Oaktree Investors each have the right to designate three directors for election to the Board at each meeting of stockholders of the Company, provided that the number of directors that the Centerbridge Investors and the Oaktree Investors each are entitled to designate will be subject to proportionate reduction in the event that the Centerbridge Investors or the Oaktree Investors, as applicable, cease to own at least 60%, 40% or 20% of their initial aggregate holdings of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis) as of the Effective Date. Furthermore, certain holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to designate one director for election to the Board at each meeting of stockholders of the Company, provided that such holders continue to own at least 60% of their initial aggregate holdings of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis) as of the Effective Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations for the Series B Preferred Stock, Honeywell has the right to elect one director\nto the Board at each meeting of stockholders of the Company, provided that at least $125 million of shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding.\nThe new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. The ability of our new directors to quickly expand their knowledge of our operations, strategies and technologies will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about our strategy and operations, particularly given the competitive environment in which our business operates. If our Board is not sufficiently informed to make these decisions, our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected.\nOther than our chief executive officer, none of the members that have been appointed to the Board were members of the Board or included in the management of the Company prior to the Chapter 11 Cases. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the new Board, or any future Boards, will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our strategic plans in the same manner as our prior Board. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe have substantial debt and may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe have substantial consolidated indebtedness. On April 30, 2021, we entered into credit facilities consisting of (i) $715 million of USD-denominated term loans, (ii) \u20ac450 million of EUR-denominated term loans and (iii) a revolving facility of $300 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,223 million of consolidated outstanding indebtedness with respect to the Credit Facilities. Furthermore, we have substantial payment obligations to Honeywell under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock (see \u201c-We have substantial payment obligations to Honeywell under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d below). As of December 31, 2021, our liabilities with respect to our payment obligations to Honeywell under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock were $395 million (representing the present value of all remaining amortization payments due under the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, discounted at a rate of 7.67% per annum). See \" - We have substantial payment obligations to Honeywell under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock.\"\nOur projected annualized cash interest expense on our term debt (net of interest rate and cross-currency swaps and excluding commitment fees and letter of credit fees) would have been approximately $40 million based on our consolidated indebtedness and interest rates as at December 31, 2021, of which approximately $9 million represents cash interest expense on variable-rate obligations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments for scheduled debt service and other obligations depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. Weakness in economic conditions and our performance beyond our expectations would exacerbate these risks. Our business may generate insufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, and currently anticipated cost savings, working capital reductions and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule, or at all. To the extent our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, aside from our current liquidity, we would be dependent on outside capital to meet the funding of our debt service and other obligations and to fund capital expenditures. We were previously forced to take actions to restructure and refinance our indebtedness and other obligations and there can be no assurances that we will be able to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations in the future.\nIf we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service and other obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or issue additional equity securities. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or issue equity securities on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and result in the acceleration of our debt obligations. Our inability to generate\nsufficient cash flows to satisfy our outstanding debt and other obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur substantial indebtedness and other obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur substantial consolidated indebtedness could have other important consequences, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022we are more highly leveraged than many of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022it may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies, or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022it may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness and other obligations;\n\u2022it may adversely affect terms under which suppliers provide material and services to us; and\n\u2022it may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets.\nThere would be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significant additional indebtedness. This could intensify the risks described above and below.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to numerous qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness we may incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Increasing our indebtedness could intensify the risks described above and below.\nOur credit facilities and the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock contains operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nThe terms governing our outstanding debt and our Series A Preferred Stock contain, and any future indebtedness we incur would likely contain, numerous restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock and make other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022create or incur certain liens;\n\u2022make certain loans, acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022engage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022enter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022transfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nA downgrade in our debt ratings could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Service maintain credit ratings on us and certain of our debt. Any decision by these ratings agencies to downgrade the ratings of debt issued in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy or to put them on negative watch in the future could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings and trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials or other vendors.\nHoneywell has the right to require the repayment of the Series B Preferred Stock in part or in full in certain circumstances.\nUnder the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, if (i) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Series B Preferred Stock) on a consolidated basis for the prior twelve months reaches $600 million for two consecutive quarters, (ii) a change of control occurs, (iii) we or our Board asserts in writing that any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock is invalid or unenforceable, (iv) our indebtedness outstanding under the Company's credit facilities is accelerated (and such acceleration is not rescinded), or (v) we or any of our material subsidiaries file for bankruptcy or similar creditor protection then, in each case, Honeywell has the right to cause us to repurchase, or in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) we will be required to repurchase, all of the remaining Series B Preferred Stock, at an amount equal to the present value of all remaining amortization payments due under the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, discounted at a rate of 7.25% per annum.\nOn September 30, 2021 and December 16, 2021, the Company filed the Series B Amendments. The Series B Amendments (i) required the Company to effect the First Early Redemption (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations) by December 21, 2021, which such redemption the Company completed on December 28, 2021, (ii) provide that the right of each holder of the Series B Preferred Stock to require the Company to redeem all of such holder\u2019s shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201cHolder Put Right\u201d) cannot be exercised until December 30, 2022 at the earliest (subject to the prior occurrence of a triggering event), and (iii) require the Company, on or before March 31, 2022, to effect the Second Early Redemption (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations), such that following the First Early Redemption and the Second Early Redemption, the Present Value (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations) of all of the remaining outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be $207,139,982 (rounded down to the nearest dollar), subject to applicable law, including that the Company has funds legally available to do so, and subject to the Company having increased the size of its revolving credit facility from $300 million to $500 million or the Company\u2019s Board of Directors having determined that the Company otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Early Redemption. The repurchases required pursuant to Honeywell's exercise of its right to cause us to repurchase shares of the Series B Preferred Stock could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or available liquidity. Additionally, on February 18, 2022, the Company intends to redeem 217,183,244 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate price of approximately $197 million.\nOur ability to carry out our business plan, fund and conduct our business, service our debt and pay dividends (if any) depends on cash flows generated by our subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company, our principal source of revenue and cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to carry out our business plan, fund and conduct our business, service our debt and pay dividends (if any) in the future will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities, and although they may be wholly owned or controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us may also be subject to, among other things, future restrictions that are contained in our subsidiaries\u2019 agreements (as entered into from time to time), availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries and applicable laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries generally will have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and stockholders. To the extent the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to us could be limited in any way, this could materially limit our ability to fund and conduct our business, service our debt and pay dividends (if any).\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade or provide negative outlook on our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading markets for our shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock (together, the \u201cVoting Securities\u201d) rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade or provide negative outlook on Voting Securities or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Voting Securities could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our business or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our Voting Securities to decline.\nOwnership positions of certain of our stockholders may lead to conflicts of interest and could negatively impact the price of our securities.\nIn connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, the Oaktree Investors have previously reported that OCM Opps GTM Holdings LLC acquired 2,874,489 shares of Common Stock and 52,555,471 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Oaktree Value Opportunities Fund Holdings LP acquired 718,622 shares of Common Stock and 14,374,581 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and Oaktree Phoenix Investment Fund LP acquired 1,904,762 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of April 30, 2021. In addition, the Centerbridge Investors have previously reported that Centerbridge Credit Partners Master, L.P. acquired 584,237 shares of Common Stock and 19,621,696 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and that Centerbridge Special Credit Partners III-Flex, L.P. acquired 2,805,763 shares of Common Stock and 48,985,486 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of April 30, 2021. These shareholdings represent a significant portion of the total voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding Voting Securities. As a result, these two stockholders in and of themselves can influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders. These two stockholders may, from time to time, have interests that differ from other stockholders, and they may each vote in a way with which other stockholders disagree and either or both may be adverse in the future to the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership of our Voting Securities may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Voting Securities as part of a sale of our Company, and consequently may affect the market price of our Voting Securities. This concentration of ownership of our Voting Securities may also have the effect of influencing the completion of a change in control that may not necessarily be in the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could make us unable to fund our capital requirements.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any additional debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing holders of our securities may experience dilution.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation (as defined below) permits our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of preferred stock which could have rights and preferences senior to those of our Common Stock or (subject to the consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and holders of the Series B Preferred Stock) the Series A Preferred Stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our securities, diluting their interest or being subject to rights and preferences senior to their own.\nWe expect to make significant grants under our equity incentive program.\nWe have reserved 31,280,476 shares of our Common Stock for issuance pursuant to awards under the Garrett Motion Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted by the Board on May 25, 2021 (the \u201cLong-Term Incentive Plan\u201d). We have made and expect to make significant grants of Common Stock or options to purchase shares of Common Stock to our employees, officers or directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, and, as of December 31, 2021, we have already granted equity-based awards with an aggregate value of $28 million with respect to 3,300,474 shares of Common Stock (assuming target performance for performance-based awards) to our employees, including significant awards that were granted to our executive officers shortly following our emergence from bankruptcy. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are granted, or options to purchase Common Stock are granted, exercised and converted, existing holders of our equity securities may experience dilution. Any such issuances of Common Stock pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan will not require stockholder approval.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (our \u201cBylaws\u201d), may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the Voting Securities held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022the ability of our Board to issue, and determine the rights, powers and preferences of, one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; and\n\u2022certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. Moreover, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding Voting Securities from merging or combining with us for a three-year period beginning on the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting securities, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Securities. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. The acquisition of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Plan by the Centerbridge Investors and the Oaktree Investors was approved by our Board for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL.\nRisks Related to Our Series A Preferred Stock\nThe trading price of our Series A Preferred Stock may decline for many reasons, including as a result of sales by initial holders pursuant to their registration rights, or the perception that such sales may occur.\nThe trading price of our Series A Preferred Stock may decline for many reasons, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our Series A Preferred Stock. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, on April 30, 2021, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with the holders of our Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock named therein to provide for resale registration rights for the holders\u2019 Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-256659), registering (i) 243,265,707 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) 52,471,709 shares of our Common Stock and (iii) 243,265,707 shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cResale Registration Statement\u201d), in each case initially issued to the selling security holders in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021. The Resale Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on June 11, 2021, which may result in the resale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock by the relevant selling security holders.\nNumerous factors, including those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following, among others, could affect the prices of our Series A Preferred Stock:\n\u2022our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\");\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future results of operations and prospects, including financial estimates and projections by securities analysts and investors or failure to meet analysts\u2019 performance expectations;\n\u2022results of operations that vary from those expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022strategic actions by our competitors;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022future sales of our Series A Preferred Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, by us, the selling security holders, significant security holders or our directors or executive officers;\n\u2022repurchases by us of our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key members of management;\n\u2022any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022changes in general and industry-specific market and economic conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural disasters, catastrophes or terrorist attacks in the geographic regions in which we operate; and\n\u2022pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks, or other public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022increased competition, or the performance, or the perceived or anticipated performance, of our competitors.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock is subordinated to our indebtedness upon liquidation.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our Series A Preferred Stock would rank below all debt and other general unsecured claims against us. As a result, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up until after all of our obligations to debt holders have been satisfied.\nPreference dividends may only be paid when, as and if declared by disinterested directors out of funds legally available.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive preference dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if declared by a committee of disinterested directors out of funds legally available thereof. Any declaration and payment of preference dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in the future will depend on our earnings and financial condition, our liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic climate, the terms of our equity securities, contractual restrictions, our ability to service any debt obligations senior to our Series A Preferred Stock and other factors deemed relevant by such committee of disinterested directors. There is no guarantee that preference dividends will be paid regularly or at all. Garrett did not declare cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock on July 1, 2021, October 1, 2021, or January 1, 2022. As a result, as of January 1, 2022, there were $97 million of unpaid cumulative preference dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of that date.\nFor more information on restrictions on our ability to declare or pay preference dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, see \u201c-The terms of the Credit Facilities restrict our ability to make dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock until December 31, 2022.\u201d\nPreference dividends may not be paid if we do not generate sufficient Consolidated EBITDA.\nNotwithstanding any other terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive a preference dividend during any period when the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock) for the most recent four fiscal quarters for which financial statements of the Company are available is less than $425 million. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not declared. The inability, or anticipated inability of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to receive preference dividends may adversely affect the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe terms of the Credit Facilities restrict our ability to make dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock until December 31, 2022.\nThe terms of the Credit Facilities include restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments or distributions on, or redeem or otherwise acquire, our outstanding equity interests, including the Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, in each case subject to certain exceptions and carve-outs. During the fiscal years ending December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, we may not make such payments or redemptions in cash solely with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock unless a ratable payment (on an as-converted basis) is made to holders of the Common Stock and such payments would otherwise be permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities. On July 21, 2021, the terms of the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock were amended to allow the payment of a ratable dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock prior to December 31, 2022 so long as the full Board ratifies the declaration by a committee of disinterested directors of the Board of any such dividend or distribution. On January 25, 2022, the Board approved a further amendment to the terms of the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock to permit the such dividends or distributions to include individually negotiated transactions, to remove the December 31, 2022 sunset date from the exception permitting such dividends and distributions, and to expressly permit the purchase, redemption or other acquisition or cash by the Company of shares of Dividend Junior Stock (as defined in the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock) without requiring ratable participation by holders of Series A Preferred Stock. These amendments were approved by written consent of the holders of a majority of our Series A Preferred Stock on February 8, 2022, and are expected to become effective on or about March 3, 2022.\nAccrued and unpaid preference dividends may be paid in Common Stock in the event of a voluntary or automatic conversion, and there may not be a market for such Common Stock.\nIn the event of a voluntary or automatic conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company will have the option to pay any accrued and unpaid preference dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in Common Stock, converted at the lesser of (i) the 30-day volume-weighted average price per share of the Common Stock of the Company at the time of such conversion; or (ii) the fair market value per share of the Common Stock of the Company at the time of such conversion as determined by the Board. There may not be a market for any shares of Common Stock that may be issued by the Company as payment for accrued and unpaid preference dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Voluntary or automatic conversions will result in significant, material dilution to holders of Common Stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into Common Stock in certain circumstances.\nAll outstanding Series A Preferred Stock will convert into Common Stock of the Company automatically (i) at any time upon the adoption of a resolution of a majority of holders of Series A Preferred Stock to convert the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock or (ii) on the first date on or after April 30, 2023, on which (A) the aggregate stated amount of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock is an amount less than or equal to $125 million; (B) the Common Stock of the Company has a 75-day volume-weighted average price per share that is greater than or equal to 150% of the conversion price (which is initially equal to $5.25 per share of Common Stock, subject to any adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock); and (C) the Company\u2019s Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months ended as of the last day of each of the two most recent fiscal quarters is greater than or equal to $600 million. Such issuances of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock may depress the price of the Common Stock and, as a consequence, cause a decrease in the price of the Series A Preferred Stock. Furthermore, holders whose shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted into Common Stock will no longer enjoy priority over other holders of Common Stock in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company. Any automatic conversions will result in significant, material dilution to holders of Common Stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our Series A preferred Stock on Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange.\nWe must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain a listing of our Series A preferred Stock on Nasdaq. If we violate Nasdaq listing standards, our Series A Preferred Stock may be delisted. If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, our Series A Preferred Stock may be delisted. In addition, our Board may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our Series A Preferred Stock may materially impair our shareholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our Series A Preferred Stock and could adversely affect the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our Series A Preferred Stock. The delisting of our Series A Preferred Stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and have a material adverse effect on the value of your investment.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at our option in certain circumstances.\nWe may, at our option, redeem all but not less than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (i) at any time following the date which is six years after the Effective Date or (ii) in connection with the consummation of a Change of Control (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designations), for a cash purchase price equal to $5.25 plus accrued and unpaid preference dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (whether or not authorized or declared) as of any such redemption date, provided that we have sufficient funds legally available to fully pay the redemption price in respect of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption. In the event we exercise our option to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, you may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from such redemption in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on your shares of Series A Preferred Stock would have been if they had not been redeemed.\nCertain holders of our Series A Preferred Stock may be restricted in their ability to transfer or sell their shares.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock was issued under the Plan to initial holders in reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code or, in certain cases, in reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued pursuant to Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code are not \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act and may be freely resold and transferred by the initial holders thereof without registration, provided that such initial holder (i) is not an \u201caffiliate\u201d of the Company as defined in Rule 144(a)(1) under the Securities Act, (ii) has not been such an \u201caffiliate\u201d within 90 days of such transfer and (iii) is not an entity that is an \u201cunderwriter\u201d as defined in Section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Any such persons would only be permitted to transfer or sell such securities without registration pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. In addition, shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued to initial holders pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144(a)(3), and are only transferable if registered under the Securities Act or if transferred pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may decline, including as a result of sales by initial holders pursuant to their registration rights, or the perception that such sales may occur.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may decline for many reasons, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our Common Stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our Common Stock.\nNumerous factors, including those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following, among others, could affect the prices of our Common Stock:\n\u2022our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future results of operations and prospects, including financial estimates and projections by securities analysts and investors or failure to meet analysts\u2019 performance expectations;\n\u2022strategic actions by our competitors;\n\u2022strategic decisions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022future sales of our securities, or the perception that such sales could occur, by us, the selling security holders, significant security holders or our directors or executive officers;\n\u2022repurchases by us of our Common Stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key members of management;\n\u2022any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022changes in general and industry-specific market and economic conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural disasters, catastrophes or terrorist attacks in the geographic regions in which we operate; and\n\u2022pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks, or other public health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022increased competition, or the performance, or the perceived or anticipated performance, of our competitors.\nOur Common Stock is subordinated to our Series A Preferred Stock and to our indebtedness upon liquidation.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, our Common Stock would rank below the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and all debt and other unsecured claims against us. As a result, holders of our Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up until after all of our obligations to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and debt and other unsecured claims have been satisfied.\nSeries A Preferred Stock votes with Common Stock on an as-converted basis.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right to vote together as a single class with holders of the Common Stock on an as-converted basis on all matters presented for a vote of the holders of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2021, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock held approximately 79.2% of the total voting power of the Company. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may have interests in matters brought before the stockholders that are different than the interests of holders of our Common Stock. While the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may not act as a group, in the instances where their interests are aligned, their ability to cast votes on an as-converted basis may affect the outcome of any stockholder votes on such matters and may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to both preference dividends and participating dividends and, except in certain circumstances, no dividends may be paid on Common Stock so long as there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock place significant limitations on our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of Common Stock, and payments made on the Series A Preferred Stock are expected to significantly reduce or eliminate any cash that we might otherwise have available for the payment of dividends on or the repurchase of shares of the Common Stock. In particular, except in certain circumstances no dividends may be paid on the Common Stock so long as there are any accrued and unpaid preference dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to such dividends or distributions paid to holders of Common Stock to the same extent as if such holders of Series A Preferred Stock had converted the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock. As a result, the success of an investment in the Common Stock may depend entirely upon any future appreciation in the value of the Common Stock. There is no guarantee that the Common Stock will appreciate in value or even maintain its initial value.\nBecause we currently have no plans to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe currently do not pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our Common Stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operation results, capital requirements, and contractual, regulatory and other restrictions, including restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock or agreements governing any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur, on the payment of dividends by us or by our subsidiaries to us, and other factors that our Board deems relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Common Stock unless you sell your shares of our Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock (including accrued and unpaid dividends) may convert into our Common Stock in certain circumstances and holders of our Common Stock will experience significant dilution.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right to convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock, initially based on a conversion price of $5.25 per share of Common Stock and the initial liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to customary conversion procedures and anti-dilution protections. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock may be automatically converted in the circumstances described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Series A Preferred Stock-The Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into Common Stock in certain circumstances\u201d above. The ownership percentage represented by any shares of Common Stock held by stockholders will be subject to significant dilution in connection with any voluntary or mandatory conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock, and any such conversion or anticipated conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales or other issuances of Common Stock or other equity securities will dilute existing holders of Common Stock and adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of Common Stock or convertible securities. As of December 31, 2021, we had 64,570,950 outstanding shares of Common Stock and 245,921,617 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including 52,471,709 shares of Common Stock and 243,265,707 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are currently outstanding and being offered by the selling security holders pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement, which may be resold in the public market.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock will have on the market price of our Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock.\nThere is an increased potential for short sales of our Common Stock due to the sale of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nDownward pressure on the market price of our Common Stock that likely will result from sales of our Series A Preferred Stock (including as a result of sales by initial holders pursuant to registration rights granted under the Registration Rights Agreement) or from sales of our Common Stock issued in connection with the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock could encourage short sales of our Common Stock by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security\u2019s price. Such sales of our Common Stock could depress the price of the stock, which could increase the potential for short sales.\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange.\nWe must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain a listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq. If we violate Nasdaq listing standards, our Common Stock may be delisted. If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, our Common Stock may be delisted. In addition, our Board may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our Common Stock may materially impair our shareholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our Common Stock and could adversely affect the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our Common Stock. The delisting of our Common Stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and have a material adverse effect on the value of your investment.\nCertain holders of our Common Stock may be restricted in their ability to transfer or sell their securities.\nThe Common Stock was issued under the Plan to stockholders in reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. These shares of Common Stock are not \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act and may be freely resold and transferred by the initial holders thereof without registration, provided that such initial holder (i) is not an \u201caffiliate\u201d of the Company as defined in Rule 144(a)(1) under the Securities Act, (ii) has not been such an \u201caffiliate\u201d within 90 days of such transfer and (iii) is not an entity that is an \u201cunderwriter\u201d as defined in Section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Any such persons would only be permitted to transfer or sell such securities without registration pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. In addition, any Common Stock issued upon a conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that were \u201crestricted securities\u201d when originally issued under the Plan will also be \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144(a)(3), and will only be transferable if registered under the Securities Act or if transferred pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSystem or service failures, including as a result of cyber or other security incidents, could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe deploy and maintain IT and engineering systems. Our systems involve sensitive information and may be conducted in hazardous environments. As a result, we are subject to systems or service failures, not only resulting from our failures or the failures of third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, but also from exposure to cyber or other security threats. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, our products, our customers and/or our third-party service providers, including cloud providers. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber and other security threats we face, and our customers are increasingly requiring cyber and other security protections and mandating cyber and other security standards in our products.\nCyber and other security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Moreover, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other intentional or inadvertent non-compliance with our security protocols may result in a breach of our information systems. Cyber and other security incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products.\nThe potential consequences of a material cyber or other security incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the United States Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cyber and other security protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action, these incidents could generate increased costs or loss of revenue if our customers choose to postpone or cancel previously scheduled orders or decide not to renew any of our existing contracts.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The successful assertion of a large claim against us with respect to a cyber or other security incident could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs, may be a distraction to our management and harm our customer relationships, as well as our reputation.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the courts of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Garrett, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the action may be brought in any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 18065, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "GTX"}
