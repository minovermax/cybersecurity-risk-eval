Risk Factors\nOur business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known\nto us or that we currently\nconsider not to be material to our operations, so you should not consider\nthe risks disclosed in this section to\nnecessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company believes that the following\nrisks could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial\nresults, financial condition and/or\nthe trading price of our common stock.\nThe order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect\ntheir\nrelative importance or priority.\nCOMPANY RISKS\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity may be negatively impacted by\nthe effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or similar wide-spread public\nhealth concerns and other\nnatural disasters\n.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the responses of governments\nto it had, and may again have, a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may\nresult in a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity may be negatively impacted by the\neffects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, similar wide-spread public health concerns,\nand other natural\ndisasters. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have,\nan unprecedented impact on society, worldwide\neconomic activity, and the health care sector (particularly, the dental market). As a global healthcare solutions\ncompany, the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it had, and may again have, a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may result in a\nmaterial adverse effect on\nour financial condition and liquidity. In March and April 2020, the dental market was severely impacted by\nCOVID-19, with many, if not a majority, of practices being closed or open on a limited basis only. Although dental\npractice openings and patient volume recovery in the United States and\nmany other countries have rebounded faster\nthan originally anticipated, patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID-19\nlevels.\nMaterial uncertainty\nremains and the potential for additional significant resurgences of COVID-19\ncould cause a significant reduction in\ndental practice openings and patient volume recovery, or further delay the return to normal operations. Even\nafter\nCOVID-19 has subsided, we may again experience material adverse\nimpacts to our business, results of operations\nand cash flows as a result of, among other things, its global economic\nimpact, including any recession that may\noccur in the future, or a prolonged period of economic slowdown or the\nreluctance of patients to return for elective\ndental or medical care. The impacts and potential impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\u2022\nSignificant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for certain of our products.\nFor example, in\nMarch and April 2020, many dental offices in the United States performed only emergency procedures,\nand\nrescheduled wellness exams and elective procedures. Dental offices in other countries\nalso experienced closures or\nrestricted operations, as did medical offices around the world. Such closures and restrictions\nimpacted our\ncustomers\u2019 spending with us and had, and if reinstated may again have, a material\nadverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Although dental practice openings and\npatient volume recovery have\nrebounded faster than originally anticipated, capacity constraints\nin offices and demand-side factors may again lead\nto reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for our products. Additionally, significant reduction in\ndemand for certain of our products or customers\u2019 decisions to delay\nthe purchase of large equipment may result in\nus having increased inventory;\n\u2022\nShortage of Certain Personal Protective Equipment (PPE\n). Supply chain disruptions for PPE and an increased\ndemand for these products has resulted, and may continue to result,\nin backorders of certain PPE and a potential\nscarcity in raw materials to make certain PPE. Prices for certain PPE have been\nvolatile. Although we believe that\nmost practices currently are able to access adequate supply, with some exceptions in certain markets depending on\na number of factors, including the progress of the virus and efforts to combat it, we\nstill may be unable to supply\nour customers with the quantity of certain PPE products they demand,\nwhich may lead to our customers seeking\nalternative sources of supply. Furthermore, healthcare professionals\u2019 inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of\ncertain PPE would\nadversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows,\nand could materially\nadversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Conversely, we recorded significant charges throughout the\nyear beginning in the second quarter for PPE inventory due to volatility\nof pricing for PPE, and, depending upon\nthe course of the pandemic, if PPE pricing or demand decreases, our\nmargins and the value of certain our PPE\ninventory could be further negatively impacted in future periods, which\ncould result in a material adverse impact on\nour business, results of operations and cash flows and our financial condition\nand liquidity;\n\u2022\nReduction in Peoples\u2019 Ability and Willingness to be in Public.\nRestrictions recommended by several public health\norganizations, and implemented by many local governments, to slow and limit the transmission\nof COVID-19\n(including business closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and similar measures)\nwere implemented and then lifted\nor partially lifted in some locations and reinstituted in others. Ongoing\nsocial distancing ordinances and similar\nrestrictions, and the actual and potential for additional resurgences of COVID-19\nhas in some locations and may in\nother locations result in the re-imposition or tightening of governmental\nsocial distancing and other restrictions,\nand/or cause people to be less willing to go to elective medical and dental\nappointments, which could again\nmaterially adversely affect demand for our products. A lengthened period of materially\nsuppressed demand could\nagain cause material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations\nand cash flows and could materially\nadversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;\n\u2022\nPotential delays in customer payments, or defaults on our customer credit arrangements.\nWe generally sell\nproducts to customers with payment terms. If customers\u2019 cash\nflows or operating and financial performance\ndeteriorate due to the impact of COVID-19, or if they are unable to make scheduled\npayments or obtain credit, they\nmay not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons, suppliers may restrict credit or\nimpose more stringent payment terms. The inability of current and/or\npotential customers to pay us for our products\nand/or services or any demands by suppliers for more stringent payment terms\nmay materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity and may limit the amounts we can\nborrow under our trade accounts receivable securitization;\n\u2022\nImpact on third parties\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us; impact on our ability to meet obligations\nto third\nparties.\nFailure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors,\ncontractors (including third-party shippers), banks, joint venture partners\nand external business partners, to meet\ntheir obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do\nso, which may be caused by their own\nfinancial or operational difficulties, or by travel restrictions and border closures, may materially\nadversely affect\nour business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity. Certain of our contracts with\nsupply partners contain minimum purchase requirements or include rebate provisions\nif we satisfy certain sales or\npurchasing targets that, in certain cases we have not been able to satisfy and in other\ncases we may not be able to\nfully satisfy, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rebate income recognized in fiscal 2020 is less than\nrebates earned over the prior fiscal year. Our failure to satisfy such contractual provisions or renegotiate\nmore\nfavorable terms could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand cash flows;\n\u2022\nNegative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused us\nto implement temporary cost reduction measures (including a payroll\ncost reduction plan centered around\nfurloughs, reduced pay and work hours, voluntary unpaid time off, suspension of Company\ncontributions to certain\nretirement plans and job reductions), all of which have now ended (except\nfor a small number of TSMs who remain\non furlough), modify our business practices (including employee\ntravel, employee work locations, and cancellation\nof physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and\nwe may take further actions as may be required\nby government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests\nof our employees. As the COVID-19\npandemic continues to unfold, we will continue to evaluate appropriate actions\nfor our business. Many of our\nemployees shifted abruptly to working remotely and our non-essential workers\nwho are able to work from home\ncontinue to do so. An extended period of modified business practices\nand remote work arrangements could have a\nnegative impact on employee morale, strain our business continuity plans,\nintroduce operational risk (including but\nnot limited to cybersecurity risks), and impair our ability to efficiently operate our\nbusiness;\n\u2022\nSignificant changes in political conditions.\nSignificant changes in political conditions in markets in which\nwe\npurchase and distribute our products have occurred and are expected to\ncontinue at least during the pendency of the\npandemic, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures\nor other restrictions that limit or\nclose our operating facilities, restrict our employees\u2019 ability to\ntravel or perform necessary business functions, or\notherwise constrain the operations of our business partners, suppliers, or\ncustomers, which may materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition\nand liquidity;\n\u2022\nPotential impact on our ability to meet obligations under credit facilities.\nAlthough in fiscal 2020 we entered into\namendments to our material credit facilities to, among other things,\nextend the maturity dates and temporarily\nprovide additional flexibility under certain covenants, an extended negative\nimpact of COVID-19 on our business,\nresults of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity could\nimpact our ability to meet our obligations\nunder credit facilities or outstanding long term debt, which contain\nmaximum leverage ratios, and customary\nrepresentations, warranties and affirmative covenants;\n\u2022\nVolatility\nin the financial markets.\nVolatility\nin the financial markets may materially adversely affect the\navailability and cost of credit to us;\n\u2022\nRefocusing management resources to mitigate effects of COVID-19\n. Our management is focused on mitigating the\neffects of COVID-19, which has required, and may continue to require for the duration of\nthe pandemic, a large\ninvestment of time and resources across the Company, and may delay certain strategic and other plans, which could\nmaterially adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nPotential\nincreased costs associated with our self-insured medical insurance programs.\nWe may incur significant\nemployee health care costs under our self-insurance medical insurance programs\nif a large number of our\nemployees and/or their covered family members become ill from COVID-19;\nand\n\u2022\nReputational risk associated with response to COVID-19.\nIf we do not respond appropriately to the COVID-19\npandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could\nsuffer damage to our reputation\nand our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.\nWe obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties, with whom we generally do not have\nlong-term contracts. While there is typically more than one source of\nsupply, some key suppliers, in the aggregate,\nsupply a significant portion of the products we sell.\nIn 2020, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and\nour\nsingle largest supplier accounted for approximately 30%\nand 4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.\nBecause of our dependence upon such suppliers, our operations are\nsubject to the suppliers\u2019 ability and willingness\nto supply products in the quantities that we require, and the risks include delays\ncaused by interruption in\nproduction based on conditions outside of our control, including\na supplier\u2019s failure to comply with applicable\ngovernment requirements (which may result in product recalls and/or\ncessation of sales) or an interruption in the\nsuppliers\u2019 manufacturing capabilities. In the event of any such\ninterruption in supply, we would need to identify and\nobtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee\nthat we would be able to obtain such\nalternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all, and an extended interruption\nin supply, particularly of a\nhigh sales volume product, could result in a significant disruption in our sales\nand operations, as well as damage to\nour relationships with customers and our reputation.\nOur\nfuture\ngrowth\n(especially\nfor\nour\ntechnology\nand\nvalue-added\nservices\nsegment)\nis\ndependent\nupon\nour\nability\nto\ndevelop\nor\nacquire\nand\nmaintain\nand\nprotect\nnew\nproducts\nand\ntechnologies\nthat\nachieve\nmarket\nacceptance with acceptable margins.\nOur future success\ndepends on our ability\nto timely develop (or\nobtain the right\nto sell) competitive\nand innovative\n(particularly\nfor\nour\ntechnology\nand\nvalue-added\nservices\nsegment),\nproducts\nand\nservices\nand\nto\nmarket\nthem\nquickly and\ncost-effectively.\nOur ability\nto anticipate\ncustomer needs\nand emerging\ntrends and\ndevelop or\nacquire\nnew products,\nservices and\ntechnologies at\ncompetitive prices\nrequires significant\nresources, including\nemployees\nwith the requisite skills, experience\nand expertise, particularly in our\ntechnology segment, including dental practice\nmanagement, patient engagement and demand creation software solutions.\nThe failure to successfully address these\nchallenges\ncould\nmaterially\ndisrupt\nour\nsales\nand\noperations.\nAdditionally,\nour\nsoftware\nand\ne-services\nproducts,\nlike\nsoftware\nproducts generally,\nmay\ncontain\nundetected errors\nor\nbugs\nwhen introduced\nor\nas\nnew\nversions\nare\nreleased. Any such defective\nsoftware may result in\nincreased expenses related to the\nsoftware and could adversely\naffect\nour\nrelationships\nwith\ncustomers\nas\nwell\nas\nour\nreputation.\nWhile\ncertain\nsoftware\nand\ne-services\nthat\nwe\ndevelop are protected\nunder patent law,\nwe rely primarily\nupon copyright, trademark\nand trade secret\nlaws, as well\nas contractual and\ncommon law protections and\nconfidentiality obligations. We\ncannot provide assurance that\nsuch\nlegal protections will be\navailable, adequate or enforceable in\na timely manner to protect\nour software or e-services\nproducts.\nOur expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves\nrisks and may not result in the benefits and\nrevenue growth we expect.\nOne of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and\ninternational markets in part through\nacquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions\nand enter into joint ventures in the\nfuture. Such transactions require significant management attention,\nmay place significant demands on our\noperations, information systems and financial resources, and there\nis risk that one or more may not succeed. We\ncannot be sure, for example, that we will achieve the benefits of revenue\ngrowth that we expect from these\nacquisitions or joint ventures or that we will avoid unforeseen additional\ncosts or expenses.\nOur ability to\nsuccessfully implement our acquisition and joint venture strategy depends\nupon, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at\nacceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially\nbe prohibited due to U.S. or\nforeign antitrust regulations;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on\nacceptable terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or\njoint ventures;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the companies\nwe acquire; and\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate these companies\u2019 operations, services,\nproducts and personnel with\nour culture, management policies, internal procedures, working capital\nmanagement, financial and\noperational controls and strategies.\nFurthermore, some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give\nrise to an obligation to make contingent\npayments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments\ncould have material adverse impacts on our\nfinancial results individually or in the aggregate.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to\nwhich we are a party may discourage\nthird parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in\nour stockholders receiving a premium\nover the market price of their shares.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may\nmake it more difficult for a third-party to\nacquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price\nthat certain investors might be willing to pay\nin the future for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions, among other things require:\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock\nentitled to vote to\napprove a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our\nassets; and\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled\nto vote to (i)\nremove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited\nexceptions.\nIn addition, certain of our employee incentive plans provide for accelerated\nvesting of stock options and other\nawards upon termination without cause within two years following a change\nin control, or grant the plan committee\ndiscretion to accelerate awards upon a change of control.\nFurther, certain agreements between us and our executive\nofficers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those\nexecutive officers are terminated\nwithout cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within\ntwo years following a change in\ncontrol or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control\nor after the first public\nannouncement of the pendency of the change in control.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive\n(including, without limitation, competition\nfrom third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating, and we may not\nbe able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Some of our\ncompetitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which\ncould allow them to compete more\nsuccessfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships\nwith several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights\nto market particular products, which we would\nthen be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their\nefforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby\neliminate or reduce our role in distribution. Industry consolidation among health\ncare product distributors and\nmanufacturers, price competition, product unavailability, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or\nto interruptions in manufacturing supply, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition.\nConsolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care\nproducts, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our margins and product availability. We\ncould be subject to charges and financial losses in the\nevent we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained\nin some of our contracts. Additionally,\ntraditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged\nby electronic online commerce\nsolutions. The continued advancement of online commerce by third\nparties will require us to cost-effectively adapt\nto changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business\n(including with additional\nvalue-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and\nour customers on a timely basis. The\nemergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and\neffectively respond to changes on a\ntimely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act\ncould materially adversely\naffect our business.\nThe U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and\nEducation Reconciliation\nAct, each enacted in March 2010, as amended (the \u201cACA\u201d), greatly expanded\nhealth insurance coverage in the\nUnited States and has been the target of litigation and Congressional reform efforts since its adoption.\nThe U.S.\nSupreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its\nindividual mandate provision in 2012,\nsimultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion,\nmaking such expansion a state-by-state\ndecision.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Congress effectively repealed the ACA\u2019s\nindividual mandate provision by eliminating\nthe financial penalty for non-compliance.\nIn the most recent ACA litigation, a federal appeals court found\nthe\nindividual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to a lower federal\ncourt for consideration of\nwhether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual\nmandate.\nThis decision was\nappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and a decision is expected soon.\nAny outcome of this case that changes the\nACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive\nOrders that do the same, could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry and our operations.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes due to political, economic and\nregulatory influences that could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing\npolitical, economic and regulatory influences.\nIn recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant\nchanges\ndriven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other factors: trends\ntoward managed care; collective\npurchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and\nchanges in\nreimbursements to customers, including increased attention to value-based payment\narrangements, as well as\ngrowing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental\nofficials. Both our profitability\nand the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws\nand regulations reducing\nreimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and devices,\nand/or medical treatments or services, or\nchanges to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.\nIf we are unable to react effectively to\nthese and other changes in the health care industry, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nExpansion of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPO\u201d) or provider networks\nand the multi-tiered costing\nstructure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure,\nwhich can vary by manufacturer and/or\nproduct. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more\nfavorable prices for medical products than we are\nable to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand\nas many large integrated health care providers\nand others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms.\nAdditionally,\nthe formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions\nto entities or persons with whom we\ndo not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete\neffectively, which could in turn\nnegatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar\nterms from manufacturers to\naccess lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and to\ndevelop relationships with existing and\nemerging provider networks and GPOs, we cannot guarantee that such terms will\nbe obtained or contracts executed.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers\ncould harm our business.\nShipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our orders through third-\nparty delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping\nrates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults. Similarly, strikes\nor other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating\nexpenses to rise and materially adversely\naffect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nMACRO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy\nand the economic outlook of the\nUnited States, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely\naffect our results of operations\nand financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:\n\u2022\nelection results;\n\u2022\nchanges to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without\nlimitation, the United States-\nMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December\n2020, and other international trade agreements);\n\u2022\ngreater restrictions on imports and exports;\n\u2022\nsupply chain disruptions due to social issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n\u2022\ntariffs and sanctions;\n\u2022\nchanges to the relationship between the United States and China;\n\u2022\nsovereign debt levels;\n\u2022\nthe inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived\neconomic, currency or\nbudgetary crises or issues;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured\nand underinsured population);\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory and tax regulations;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates;\n\u2022\navailability of capital;\n\u2022\nincreases in fuel and energy costs;\n\u2022\nthe effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase\nprices over time;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n\u2022\nincreases in health care costs;\n\u2022\nthe threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and\ninvestment in territories and\ncountries where we do business.\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government\nspending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending,\nand/or higher income or corporate\ntaxes, which could depress spending overall. Recessionary conditions and depressed\nlevels of consumer and\ncommercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products\nand may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.\nWe generally sell products to\ncustomers with payment terms. If customers\u2019 cash flow or operating and\nfinancial performance deteriorate, or if\nthey are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not\nbe able to, or may delay, payment to us.\nLikewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment\nterms.\nREGULATORY\nAND LITIGATION RISKS\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements\ncould materially adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe laws and regulations that govern our business and operations are\nsubject to varying and evolving\ninterpretations, future changes, additions, and enforcement approaches\n(including in light of political changes, such\nas with respect to the new administration of President Biden) that\naffect our ability to comply.\nFor example,\nPresident Biden\u2019s administration has authorized and encouraged a freeze on certain federal regulations\nthat have\nbeen published but are not yet effective, as well as a review of all federal regulations\nissued during President\nTrump\u2019s administration.\nChanges with respect to the applicable laws and regulations may\nrequire us to update or\nrevise our operations, services, marketing practices, and compliance programs\nand controls, and may impose\nadditional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial\nrisks to us, or may otherwise have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nThere can be no assurance that current and future government\nregulations\nwill not adversely affect our business, and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities,\nthe form, content or timing\nof regulatory actions, and their impact on the health care industry and on\nour business and operations.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on\nproduct pricing.\nIn the United\nStates, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been\nincreased scrutiny on drug\npricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President,\nexecutive branch agencies\nand various states. At the state level, several states have adopted\nlaws that require drug manufacturers to provide\nadvance notice of certain price increases and to report information\nrelating to those price increases, while others\nhave taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug\naffordability boards or multi-payer\npurchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\nAt the federal level, several related bills have been\nintroduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized,\nrespectively, would impact drug pricing and\nrelated costs.\nUnder the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, we are required to collect\nand report detailed information regarding\ncertain financial relationships we have with covered recipients, such as\nphysicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.\nWe or our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state transparency laws that address\ncircumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and\nsome of these state laws, as well as the\nfederal law, can be ambiguous.\nWe are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain\ninteractions between suppliers and their customers.\nWhile we believe we have substantially compliant programs\nand controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements,\nsuch compliance imposes additional costs on us\nand the requirements are sometimes ambiguous.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase\nhealth-related price transparency may also affect our business.\nOur business is subject to additional requirements under various local, state,\nfederal and international laws and\nregulations applicable to the sale and distribution of, and third-party\npayment for, pharmaceuticals and medical\ndevices, human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products (\u201cHCT/P products\u201d).\nAmong the federal laws\nwith which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act,\nthe U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as\namended (\u201cFDC Act\u201d), the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act, including\nDrug Supply Chain Security Act\n(\u201cDSCSA\u201d), and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act. Among\nother things, such laws, and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder:\n\u2022\nregulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting,\nrecord keeping,\nintroduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products\nand medical devices, including\nrequirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers;\n\u2022\nsubject us to inspection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d)\nand the U.S. Drug\nEnforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), and similar state authorities;\n\u2022\nregulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products\nthat are considered\nhazardous materials;\n\u2022\nrequire us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance\nwith applicable FDA\nrequirements;\n\u2022\nrequire registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n\u2022\nrequire record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n\u2022\nrequire us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious\norders of controlled\nsubstances to the DEA;\n\u2022\nrequire us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject\nus to inspection of our\nrecall procedures and activities;\n\u2022\nimpose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or\nmedical device causes\nserious illness, injury or death;\n\u2022\nrequire manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers of prescription\ndrugs to identify and\ntrace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed;\n\u2022\nrequire the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party\nlogistics providers; and\n\u2022\nmandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping, storage\nand handling of prescription drugs,\nand associated reporting requirements.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (the \u201cCures Act\u201d), signed into law on\nDecember 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition\nto exclude certain software from\nFDA regulation, including certain clinical decision support software.\nCertain of our businesses involve the\ndevelopment and sale of software and related products to support physician\nand dental practice management, and it\nis possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine\nthat one or more of our products is\nsubject to regulation as a medical device, which could subject us or one\nor more of our businesses to substantial\nadditional requirements, costs, and potential enforcement actions or liabilities\nfor noncompliance with respect to\nthese products.\nApplicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require\nus to meet various standards\nrelating to, among other things, licensure or registration, program eligibility, procurement, third-party\nreimbursement, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and\nsupply tracking to product manufacturers,\nproduct labeling, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal\ninformation, installation, maintenance\nand repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products.\nThe FDA and DEA, as well as CMS\n(including with respect to complex Medicare reimbursement requirements\napplicable to our specialty home medical\nsupplies business), have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement\nactivities and, in particular, the DEA\nhas heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the United States.\nOur business is also subject to\nrequirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations\naffecting our operations abroad.\nThe failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations, or new\ninterpretations of existing laws and\nregulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations,\ncould materially adversely affect our business.\nThe costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable\nstatutes and regulations, as they now exist\nand as they may be modified, could be material.\nAllegations by a governmental body that we have not complied\nwith these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially\ncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate\ncompliance programs and controls in\nplace to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have\nnot complied with these laws, we are\npotentially subject to penalties, including warning letters, substantial civil and\ncriminal penalties, mandatory recall\nof product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension\nor limitation of product sale and\ndistribution.\nIf we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance,\nwe could be required\nto make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including\nfines and the loss of licenses.\nNon-compliance with government requirements could also adversely affect our ability\nto participate in important\nfederal and state government health care programs, such as Medicare\nand Medicaid, and damage our reputation.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation may adversely affect our business.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745 (\u201cEU MDR\u201d) was meant\nto become applicable three years after\npublication (in May 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow EEA national authorities, notified bodies,\nmanufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the COVID-19\npandemic, the European\nCouncil and Parliament adopted Regulation 2020/561, postponing the date\nof application of the EU MDR by one\nyear (to May 2021).\nThe EU MDR significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory\ncompliance requirements\nfor the medical device industry as a whole.\nOnce applicable, the EU MDR will among other things:\n\u2022\nStrengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance\nonce they are\navailable;\n\u2022\nEstablish explicit provisions on manufacturers\u2019\nresponsibilities for the follow-up of the quality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022\nImprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain\nto the end-user or patient\nthrough a unique identification number;\n\u2022\nSet up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and\nthe public with\ncomprehensive information on products available in the EU;\n\u2022\nStrengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as\nimplants, which may have to\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n\u2022\nIdentify importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EudaMed not due until 2022 and after).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product\u2019s clinical evaluation and a company\u2019s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance.\nMedical devices that have\nbeen assessed and/or certified under the EU Medical Device Directive may\ncontinue to be placed on the market\nuntil 2024 (or until the expiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier);\nhowever, requirements regarding the\ndistribution, marketing and sale including quality systems and post-market surveillance\nhave to be observed by\nmanufacturers, importers and distributors as of the application date.\nThe modifications created by the EU MDR may have an impact on the\nway we design and manufacture products\nand the way we conduct our business in the European Economic Area.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care\nfraud or other laws and regulations, we\ncould suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations,\nwhich could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse\nclaims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral\nof a patient or ordering,\npurchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services\nthat are\npaid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and federal laws, such\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d prohibit physicians and other\nhealth professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician\n(or family member) has a\nfinancial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services\n(for example, durable medical\nequipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of \u201crelators\u201d who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, and could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs,\nincluding the loss of licenses and the\nability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nAlso, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial,\nregulatory or judicial authority in\na manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial\ndefense and settlement\nexpenses.\nEven unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private\nrelators could result in reputational\nharm and the incurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these\nstate\nlaws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims\nAct penalties, as well as other fraud\nand abuse laws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians,\ndentists and other health care providers,\non the other.\nAs a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices\nas necessary to facilitate\ncompliance.\nIn the EU, the Directive No. 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019\non the protection of persons who report breaches of\nUnion law\nwhich organizes the legal protection of whistleblowers must be implemented by EU\nmember states by\nDecember 17, 2021. This Directive covers whistleblowers reporting breaches\nof certain EU laws, in particular as\nregards public health, the above-mentioned Directive No. 2001/83, Regulation\nNo. 726/2004 or, as regards data\nprotection, the GDPR. The Directive protects a wide range of people and\nincludes former employees.\nAll private\ncompanies with 50 or more employees are required to create effective internal reporting\nchannels.\nWe also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nOur businesses are generally subject to\nnumerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial\nresults, including, without limitation,\nsecurities, antitrust, consumer protection, and marketing laws and regulations.\nIn the EU, both active and passive bribery are criminalized. The EU Council\nFramework Decision 2003/568/JHA\nof 22 July 2003\non combating corruption in the private sector\nestablishes more detailed rules on the liability of\nlegal persons and deterrent sanctions. However, the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national\nlevel.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and other\nlaws and regulations, could result in\nsignificant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of\nlicenses and the ability to participate in\nfederal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nWe may\ndetermine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees\nor enter into other arrangements to\nresolve such matters.\nIntentional or unintentional failure to comply with consent decrees could\nmaterially adversely\naffect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse and other laws and\nregulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our\nservices or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or\ninterpretation of laws, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality\nof sensitive personal information or\nstandards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could\nbe required to make significant changes to our\nproducts, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home medical\nsupply business, include electronic information technology systems that\nstore and process personal health, clinical,\nfinancial and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be vulnerable\nto breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which\ncould require us to expend\nsignificant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security\nconcerns, and could involve claims\nagainst us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nWe are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations\nthat protect the privacy and security of personal information, such as the\nHIPAA, the Controlling the Assault of\nNon-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Protection and Electronic Protection Act of 1991,\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the CCPA, and the CPRA that becomes effective on January 1,\n2023.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually\nevolving and subject to\npotentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized,\nmay be interpreted and applied in\na manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict\nwith other rules or our practices.\nOur\nbusinesses\u2019 failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us\nto breach of contract claims,\nsubstantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation\nand harm to our reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability\nof our customers to obtain, use or\ndisseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant\nadditional costs to re-design our products to\nreflect these legal requirements, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our operations.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union\nhave adopted the GDPR, which\nincreases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, or \u201cData Subjects\u201d,\nincluding individuals who are our customers,\nsuppliers and employees.\nThe GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers\nand data processors\nand generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties\non companies, such as us, that offer goods or\nservices to Data Subjects or monitor their behavior (including by\ncompanies based outside of Europe).\nNoncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20\nmillion, or 4% of global company revenues.\nData Subjects also have the right to seek compensation for damages.\nEU member states may individually impose\nadditional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters,\nsuch as employee personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became\neffective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections\nregarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information\nof California residents.\nCompliance\nwith the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply\nthem, and because the CCPA is relatively new,\nand its implementing regulations were released in August of\n2020,\nthere remains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the\nregulators. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA,\nwe may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our\nreputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business.\nFurthermore, California voters\napproved the CPRA on November 3, 2020, which will amend and\nexpand the CCPA, including by providing\nconsumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information,\nand creating a new state agency to\nenforce CCPA and CPRA.\nThe CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected\nby businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of similarly expansive\npersonal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance.\nWhile we believe we have\nsubstantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with\nthe GDPR, CCPA and CPRA requirements,\nour compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs\non us, and we cannot predict whether the\ninterpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response\nto new requirements or interpretations of\nthe requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers and we are subject to laws, regulations and\nindustry\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records. Our products or services\nmay be used as part of these customers\u2019\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their\nefforts to comply with applicable data\nprivacy and security laws and contractual requirements.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products\nor services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who\nuse our products or services to comply\nwith applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements,\nmay not only cause us significant\nreputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers\nand/or governmental agencies and\ninvolve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses\nand costs for remediation.\nUnder the EU GDPR, health data belong to the category of \u201csensitive data\u201d\nand benefit from specific protections.\nProcessing of such data is generally prohibited, except for specific exceptions.\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of electronic\nhealth record (\u201cEHR\u201d) systems and other\nproducts linked to government supported incentive programs, where\nthe EHR systems must be certified as having\ncertain capabilities designated in evolving standards, such as those adopted\nby CMS and by the Office of the\nNational Coordinator for Health Information\nTechnology of HHS (\u201cONC\u201d).\nIn order to maintain certification of\nour EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards.\nIf any of our EHR systems do not meet\nthese standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive\nfederal incentive payments, we may\nbe exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws,\nincluding the False Claims Act.\nWhile\nwe believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications\nand with applicable fraud and abuse laws and\nregulations and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial compliance,\nwe cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or resulting changes in our, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex\nreporting\nfunctionality.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve\nincreased costs,\nand our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy\napplicable standards, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with\nan electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives\nmay be proposed that could materially\nadversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not\nbe materially\nadversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. In addition, tax\nlaws and regulations are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our\nhistorical tax positions are sound and\nconsistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent,\nthere can be no assurance that our tax positions\nwill not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be\nsuccessful in any such challenge.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the\nevent that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant\nin cases as a result of our distribution of\nproducts. Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we\ncould be subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating\nto the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities. In addition,\nas our private-label business continues\nto grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate\nproduct manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products\nis liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply\nchain.\nIn addition, some of the\nproducts that we transport and sell are considered hazardous\nmaterials. The improper handling of such materials or\naccidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us\nto liability or at least legal action that\ncould harm our reputation.\nGENERAL RISKS\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our\ntechnology products and services could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected if\nsuch products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted,\ndamaged by unforeseen\nevents, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of\ntime.\nWe rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer,\nproduct, supplier and employee data to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and\ndistribution of thousands of\ninventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of\ncustomers;\n\u2022\nprocess payments to suppliers; and\n\u2022\nprovide products and services that maintain certain of our customers\u2019 electronic\nmedical or dental\nrecords (including protected health information of their patients).\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a\ncyberattack that bypasses our IS security\nsystems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach\nmay lead to a material disruption\nof our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or\nthe loss of business information, as\nwell as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve\nfines and penalties, costs\nfor remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition,\nwe develop products and provide\nservices to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack\nthat bypasses the IS security systems of our\nproducts or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security\nvulnerabilities in our products or services\ncould also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm, and actual\nor perceived vulnerabilities may lead\nto claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.\nIn particular, certain of our practice\nmanagement products and services purchased by health care providers, such\nas physicians and dentists, are used to\nstore and manage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers are subject to laws and regulations which\nrequire that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our\nproducts may be used as part of these\ncustomers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection\nwith their efforts to comply with\napplicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities\nin our products or services, or the\nperceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products\nto comply with applicable legal\nrequirements, may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business,\nbut may also lead to claims against us by\nour customers and/or governmental agencies and involve damages, fines and\npenalties, costs for remediation, and\nsubstantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition, a cyberattack\non a third-party that we use to manage a\nportion of our information systems could result in the same effects.\nAdditionally, legislative or regulatory action\nrelated to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement\nnew technology products and services.\nFurthermore, procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new\nIS challenges, and enhancing\nprotections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional\ncosts on us.\nFinally, our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of IS systems providers engaged by our customers, such\nas\nInternet-based services upon which our customers depend to access certain of\nour products.\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nOur global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business. The\nrisks that our\nglobal operations are subject to include, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products, establishing channels of distribution and\ncontract\nmanufacturing in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies (including, without limitation,\nin connection with\nBrexit);\n\u2022\nuncertainties relating to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020, including\nfor example potential implementation problems such as border delays, as\nwell as potential changes to\nthe U.K. regulatory scheme to replace EU requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables\nin foreign\njurisdictions;\n\u2022\nrepatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements, including without limitation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining\nto the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n\u2022\nunexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and import/export\ntariffs, quotas,\nsanctions or penalties;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual\nproperty;\n\u2022\nunexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political\nor military coups; and\n\u2022\npublic health emergencies, including COVID-19.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior\nmanagement, and our revenues and profitability\ndepend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as\ncustomers, suppliers and manufacturers of\nthe products that we distribute.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of\nmembers of our existing senior\nmanagement, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of\nMr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr.\nBergman. We do not currently have \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for\nsenior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining key personnel. Additionally,\nour future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to\nmaintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales\npersonnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we\nfail to maintain our existing relationships with\nsuch persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the\nfuture, our business may be materially\nadversely affected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely\naffect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with\nrespect to indebtedness will depend on\nour operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing\neconomic conditions and financial,\nbusiness and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may materially adversely affect\nthe availability and cost of credit to us.", "PERMNO": 82581, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "HSIC"}
