{"cik": "1442741", "company": "Xenith Bankshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following factors should be carefully considered in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained herein. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, regulatory capital levels and prospects. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could be materially and adversely affected. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, regulatory capital levels and prospects.\nSlow economic growth, especially in our target markets, could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe most recent recession contributed to a rise in unemployment and underemployment, a decline in the value of real estate and other assets, and a lack of confidence in the financial markets and the economy both among financial institutions and their customers. Although some improvement is evident, economic growth has been slow and the economic pressure on consumers and commercial borrowers continues to affect the willingness of companies to borrow to fund future growth, which negatively impacts our business. A protracted continuation or worsening of economic conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the banking industry and our business.\nUnlike many of our larger competitors, the majority of our middle market business and individual customers are located or doing business in our target markets. As a result, we may be more impacted by local economic conditions than those of larger, more geographically diverse competitors. Furthermore, based on the size and resources of our middle market and small business customers, they may be less able to withstand sustained difficult economic conditions than larger companies with which they compete. Factors that adversely affect the economy in our target markets could reduce our deposit base and demand for our services and products and increase our credit losses. Consequently, we may be adversely affected, potentially materially, by adverse changes in economic conditions in and around Virginia.\nAlthough we have monitored the impact of slow economic growth on the businesses of our customers and on the values of real estate in our target markets and have set discounts and reserves against our loan portfolio, our discounts and reserves may be insufficient.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce our operating results as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on our loans and investments and interest paid on our deposits and borrowings.\nLike other banks, our operating results are significantly dependent on our net interest income, as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We will experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, as measured by the\nrelative duration of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The net position of those assets and liabilities, subject to re-pricing in specified time periods, will positively or negatively affect our operating results. If market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d may work against us and negatively affect our operating results, potentially materially. We cannot predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, recession, monetary policy, and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Although our asset-liability management strategy is intended to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect us. As reflected in \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Interest Rate Sensitivity-Gap Analysis,\u201d on a cumulative basis for maturities and re-pricings within the next 12 months, we reflect interest rate-sensitive assets exceeding interest rate-sensitive liabilities resulting in an asset sensitive position as of December 31, 2014 of $320.8 million, which would reduce our operating results if market interest rates were to decline during that period.\nChanges in market interest rates could reduce the value of our financial assets. Fixed rate investments and loans generally decrease in value as interest rates rise. In addition, volatile interest rates may affect the volume of our lending activities. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations may decrease. This could result in lower net interest income, lower loan origination fee income, and a decline in sales of treasury services. If we are unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition in our target markets.\nThe financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we have encountered and will continue to encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial services and products in our target markets. Our principal competitors for loans and some or all of our other services and products are other commercial banks and community banks in our target markets. Our principal competitors for deposits include commercial banks, community banks, money market funds, credit unions and trust companies. Our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and, accordingly, have advantages over us in providing certain products and services. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources that permit them to offer attractive terms and broader selections to gain market share for their products and services and also have higher lending capacity and larger branch networks. Weak loan demand has increased competition resulting in aggressive pricing and loosening terms for borrowers. As a result, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract customers, either of which would adversely affect us.\nFailure to implement our business strategies could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have developed a business plan that details the business strategies we intend to implement. Our business plan includes organic growth and, where appropriate, growth through acquisitions. Our organic growth may involve an expansion into related banking lines of business and related services and products, which would involve additional risks. Growth through acquisitions also includes risks, which are further discussed below. If we cannot implement our business strategies, we will be hampered in our ability to maintain and grow our business and serve our customers, which would in turn materially and adversely affect us. Even if our business strategies are successfully implemented, they may not have the favorable impact on our operations that we anticipate.\nFailure to manage expansion could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to offer services and products and implement our business strategies successfully in a highly competitive market requires an effective planning and management process. Future expansion efforts, internally or through acquisitions, could be expensive and put a strain on our management, financial, operational and technical resources. To manage growth effectively, we will likely have to continue to enhance our operating systems and controls, as well as integrate new personnel, including relationship managers, and manage expanded operations. If we are unable to grow our business or manage our growth effectively, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will face risks with respect to future expansion and through acquisitions or mergers.\nWe may seek to acquire other financial institutions or branches or assets of those institutions. We may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, the outcome of which is uncertain;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments or lack of information to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or its branches or assets;\n\u2022\ndiluting our existing shareholders in an acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices or branches, as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities and when we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\ninvesting a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans, resulting in management\u2019s time and attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nthe ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received or executed;\n\u2022\ntime and costs associated with regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional capital or financing, if necessary, on favorable terms or at all; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen adjustments, write-downs, write-offs, or restructuring or other impairment charges.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions with which we do business could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, acting as a counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including counterparties in the financial industry, such as commercial banks. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions will expose us to risk of loss in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, this risk may be exacerbated when any collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. Our losses from these events could be material.\nOur earnings are sensitive to the credit risks associated with lending.\nThe credit risk associated with commercial and industrial loans is a result of several factors, including the concentration of our loan portfolio in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, which is generally larger than consumer loans, and the effects of general economic conditions on a borrower\u2019s business. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio represented approximately 47.9% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014. Any significant default by our commercial and industrial customers would materially and adversely affect us.\nOur commercial and industrial loans include owner-occupied real estate loans that are secured in part by the value of the real estate. Owner-occupied real estate loans represented approximately 14.7% of our total commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014. The primary source of repayment for owner-occupied real estate loans is the cash flow produced by the related commercial enterprise, and the value of the real estate is a secondary source of repayment of the loan.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio represented approximately 35.6% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014. Commercial real estate loans will typically be larger than consumer loans and may pose greater risks than other types of loans. Underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot eliminate all risks related to these loans. It may be more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner in the current economic climate, as commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 abilities to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development of their properties. In addition, we may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates, which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. Given the weaknesses in the commercial real estate market in general, there may be loans where the value of our collateral has been negatively impacted. A further weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default of these loans, which could negatively impact our loan portfolio\u2019s performance and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, we could incur material losses. In addition, banking regulators give greater scrutiny to commercial real estate lending and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved or additional underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing. In banks with certain levels of commercial real estate loan concentrations, regulators may require increased levels of reserves for loan losses, as well as the need for additional capital. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management time and attention, and materially and adversely affect us.\nDecisions regarding credit risk in our investment or loan portfolios could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan and lease losses may be inadequate to absorb future losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur loan portfolio and a portion of our investment portfolio expose us to credit risk. Of our $74.0 million investment portfolio, $48.3 million, or 65.2%, were securities other than U.S. agency securities as of December 31, 2014. Of the $48.3 million, $28.1 were securities issued as general obligations of states or political subdivisions. Inherent risks in lending include the deterioration of the credit of borrowers and adverse changes in the industries and competitive environments in which they operate, changes in borrowers\u2019 management and business prospects, fluctuations in interest rates and collateral values, principally real estate, and economic downturns. Making loans is an essential element of our business, and there is a high risk that some portion of the loans we make will not be repaid and, accordingly, will result in losses. Given our size, these losses could be concentrated in one or more borrowers and could be significant.\nThe risk of loss is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncredit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nIn addition, we may suffer higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or other regulatory action that reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay to us, prohibits or otherwise limits our ability to foreclose on properties or other collateral, or makes foreclosures less economically viable.\nAs with all financial institutions, our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio, and we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses and other reserves to absorb anticipated future losses inherent in our portfolio.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase reserves or recognize loan charge-offs. Because our allowance methodologies take into account qualitative factors within our institution as well as the external economic environment, there is potential for inconsistencies in our methodology and the methodologies deemed appropriate for us by the bank regulatory agencies.\nIf management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate and our allowance for loan and lease losses is inadequate to absorb future losses inherent in our loan portfolio, or if bank regulatory agencies require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses or to recognize loan charge-offs, our capital could be significantly reduced, and we could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be different than initially estimated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nAs required by acquisition accounting rules, we record acquired loans at estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition by creating a discount and eliminating the allowance for loan and lease losses. To the extent the credit losses of the purchased loans are greater than fair value adjustments determined at the effective date of acquisitions, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe acquired a significant portion of our loans held for investment in the mergers and acquisitions we have completed since and including the First Bankshares Merger. Although these loans were recorded at their estimated fair values, as of the effective date of the transaction, there is no assurance that the acquired loans will not suffer further deterioration in value resulting in additional charge-offs and a reduction in our net income.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We also rely on representations of those customers or counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could result in losses that materially and adversely affect us. Even if we receive accurate information, we may misjudge that information and fail to assess the credit risks in a manner that materially and adversely affects us.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the value of collateral backing a loan may be less than supposed, and if a default occurs, we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nCommercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators could impact our operations and capital requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC, along with the other federal banking regulators, issued guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d directed at financial institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their loan portfolios. This guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed certain percentages of capital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Based on our commercial real estate concentration as of December 31, 2014, we are not subject to additional supervisory analysis but could be in the future. Our management has implemented controls to monitor our commercial real estate lending and will continue to enhance and monitor those controls, but we cannot predict the extent to which this guidance may impact our future operations or capital requirements. Also, any risk management practices that we implement may not be effective to prevent losses in our loan portfolio, including our commercial real estate portfolio.\nOur ability to maintain regulatory capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be adversely affected by market conditions, concentration of customer deposits within certain businesses and industries, and changes in capital requirements made by our regulators.\nWe are required to maintain certain capital levels sufficient to maintain capital ratios that classify the Bank as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d in accordance with banking regulations. We must also seek to maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our lending and investment operations and repay our outstanding liabilities as they become due. Our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels, available sources of funding, and sufficient liquidity could be impacted by the concentration of customer deposits within certain businesses and industries and deteriorating economic and market conditions.\nOur failure to meet any applicable regulatory guideline related to our lending activities or any capital requirement otherwise imposed upon us or to satisfy any other regulatory requirement could subject us to certain activity restrictions or to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the regulatory authorities, including limitations on our ability to pay dividends or pursue acquisitions, the issuance by regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.\nIn determining the adequacy of our capital levels, we use risk-based capital ratios established by regulations. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC, adopted the Basel III Rules, which establish a stricter regulatory capital framework that requires banking organizations to hold more and higher-quality capital to act as a financial cushion to absorb losses and help banking organizations better withstand periods of financial stress. The Basel III Rules increase capital ratios for all banking organizations and introduce a \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d which is in addition to each capital ratio. If a banking organization dips into its capital conservation buffer, it would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nIn calculating our risk-based ratios, we must apply risk weights to our various asset classes. The Basel III Rules assign a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures to various categories of assets, including certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. The Basel III Rules also require unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. We may make a one-time, permanent election in our March 31, 2015 filing to continue to exclude AOCI from capital. If we do not make this election, unrealized gains and losses would be included in the calculation of our regulatory capital. The Basel III Rules also include changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a two-year transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying\ncapital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period.\nThe Basel III Rules became effective January 1, 2015. The conservation buffer will be phased in beginning in 2016 and will take full effect on January 1, 2019. Although we generally began complying with the Basel III Rules on January 1, 2015, we believe we satisfied the higher capital ratios imposed by the Basel III Rules as of December 31, 2014.\nAlthough we currently cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that the Basel III Rules will have on us and the banking industry more generally, we will be required to maintain higher regulatory capital levels, which could impact our operations, net income and ability to grow. Furthermore, our failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us, which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the \u201cFederal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof,\u201d with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\u201cUDAAP authority\u201d). The potential reach of the CFPB\u2019s broad new rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank, is currently unknown.\nThe Bank is subject to federal and state and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Bank\u2019s performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity, and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to access funding sufficient to support our growth.\nOur business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, and general economic conditions. If our deposit levels fall, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funding, and our costs would increase from alternative funding. If local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund our growth, we will look to outside sources such as borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB\u201d), which is a secured funding source. Our ability to access borrowings from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and the extent to which we can provide collateral. We may also look to federal funds purchased and brokered deposits as discussed below under \u201c-Our use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by bank regulators, which could adversely impact our liquidity\u201d or seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-related securities or the incurrence of debt as additional sources of liquidity. If we are unable to access funding sufficient to support our growth or are only able to access such funding on unattractive terms, we may not be able to implement our business strategies.\nWe rely substantially on deposits made by our customers in our target markets, which can be materially and adversely affected by local and general economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $475.4 million, or 61.5%, of our total deposits, consisted of noninterest-bearing demand accounts and interest-bearing savings, money market and demand accounts. The $297.6 million remaining balance of deposits includes time deposits, of which approximately $170.3 million, or 22.0% of our total deposits, are due to mature within one year. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, as well as our cost of funds, has been and will continue to be\nsignificantly affected by rates offered by competitors, alternative investment opportunities, monetary policy and general economic conditions. We have significant deposits from certain customers that are in excess of the FDIC insurance amounts. Customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with our Bank is fully insured or may place them in other financial institutions that they perceive as being more secure. The loss of customers that maintain significant deposits with the Bank could have an adverse effect on this critical funding source. If we fail to attract new deposits or maintain existing deposits or are forced to increase interest rates paid to customers to attract and maintain deposits, our net interest income would be negatively impacted, and we could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by bank regulators, which could adversely impact our liquidity.\nDepositors that invest in brokered deposits are generally interest-rate sensitive and well informed about alternative markets and investments. Consequently, these types of deposits may not provide the same stability to a bank\u2019s deposit base as traditional local retail deposit relationships. In addition, our liquidity may be negatively affected if that funding source experiences supply difficulties due to loss of investor confidence or a flight to other investments. Regulatory developments with respect to wholesale funding, including increased FDIC insurance costs for, or limits on the use of these deposits, may further limit the availability of that alternative. In light of regulatory pressure, there may be a cost premium for locally generated certificates of deposit as compared to brokered deposits, which may increase our cost of funding.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need additional capital to support our business, expand our operations, or maintain our minimum capital requirements; however, we may not be able to raise additional funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-related securities. Furthermore, the significant amount of our common stock that BankCap Partners owns may discourage other potential investors from acquiring newly-issued shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-related securities.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and other creditors.\nOur liquidity is used to make loans and investments and to repay liabilities (including deposits), as they become due or are demanded by depositors and other creditors. Our main source of liquidity is customer deposits. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and investment securities sold under repurchase agreements, as well as the sale of loans, securities (to the extent not pledged as collateral) or other assets, the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, brokered deposits, borrowings from the FHLB, borrowings through the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window, borrowings from other banks, and the issuance of our debt securities and equity securities. Without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and other creditors, or to operate and grow our business.\nAs we continue to grow, we may become more dependent on wholesale funding sources, which may include FHLB borrowings and borrowings through the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window. As of December 31, 2014, we had $20.0 million of FHLB borrowings and $86.8 million of brokered deposits outstanding. If we are required to rely more heavily on wholesale funding sources to support our operations or growth in the future and such funding is expensive at such time, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In that case, our operating margins would be reduced, and we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may become subject to significant liabilities in the event the Bank forecloses upon, or takes title to, real property.\nWhen underwriting a commercial or residential real estate loan, we will generally take a lien on the real property and, in some instances upon a default by the borrower, we may foreclose upon and take title to the property, which may lead to potential financial risk for us under applicable environmental laws. We may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. We may also own and lease premises where branches and other facilities are located. While we have lending, foreclosure and facilities guidelines intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Bank may own, manage or occupy. We face the risk that environmental laws could force us to clean up the properties at our expense. It may cost much more to remediate a property than the property is worth. We could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations, if the Bank takes a role in managing those operations after a default. Many environmental laws impose liability, regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, any contamination that existed or exists for the property. The Bank may also find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. These costs could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our net income.\nThe disposition processes related to our nonperforming assets could result in losses in the future that would materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming loans and other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), and such losses could be material. When we acquire title to collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required by accounting rules to mark such collateral to the then fair market value, less costs of disposal, which could result in a loss. Nonperforming assets adversely affect net income in various ways. While we pay interest expense to fund nonperforming assets, no interest income is recorded on nonaccrual loans or OREO, thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity. Additionally, we incur loan administration costs and the costs of maintaining properties carried as OREO. Nonperforming loans and OREO also increase our risk profile, and increases in the level of nonperforming loans and OREO could impact our regulators\u2019 view of appropriate capital levels in light of such risks.\nWhile we seek to manage our problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings, foreclosures and otherwise, decreases in the value of these assets, or in the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our or their control, could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, diverting their time from other business, which could be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities on our behalf.\nGiven the geographic concentration of our operations, we could be significantly affected by any natural or man-made disaster that affects Virginia and surrounding areas.\nOur operations are concentrated in, and our loan portfolio consists almost entirely of, loans to persons and businesses located in and around Virginia. The collateral for many of our loans consists of real and personal property located in areas susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters as well as man-made disasters that can cause extensive damage to the general region. Disaster conditions that hit in our target markets would adversely affect the local economies and real estate markets. Adverse economic conditions resulting from such a disaster could negatively affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and could reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans. Furthermore, damage resulting from any natural or man-made disaster could also result in continued economic uncertainty that could negatively impact businesses in those areas. As a result, we could be materially and adversely affected by any natural or man-made disaster that affects our target markets.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel, including our executive officers, and the loss of such persons could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategies.\nWe will be for the foreseeable future dependent on the services of T. Gaylon Layfield, III, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas W. Osgood, who is our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Judy C. Gavant, who is our Controller and Principal Accounting Officer; Wellington W. Cottrell, III, who is our Chief Credit Officer; Ronald E. Davis, who is our Chief Operations and Technology Officer; Edward H. Phillips, Jr., who is our Chief Lending Officer; and W. Jefferson O\u2019Flaherty, who is an Executive Vice President responsible for our private banking business. Should the services of these individuals or other key executive officers become unavailable, we may be unable to find a suitable successor who would be willing to be employed upon the terms and conditions that we would offer. A failure to replace any of these individuals in a timely and effective manner could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategies and otherwise disrupt our business.\nOur business is dependent on technology and an inability to invest in technological improvements or obtain reliable technological support may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven services and products. In addition to better serve our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our ability to grow and compete will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide services and products that will satisfy their operational needs, while managing the costs of expanding our technology infrastructure. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and third-party support. For the foreseeable future, we expect to rely on third-party service providers for our core technology systems and on other third parties for technical support and related services. If we are unable to implement and market new technology-driven services and products successfully, or if those services and products become unreliable or fail, our customer relationships and operations could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nSystem failure or breaches, including \u201chacking,\u201d \u201ccyber fraud\u201d or \u201cidentity theft,\u201d of our network security could lead to increased operating costs, as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues, including \u201chacking,\u201d \u201ccyber fraud\u201d and \u201cidentity theft.\u201d Our operations are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by our customers and us, including our Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us, damage our reputation, and inhibit current and potential customers from our Internet banking services. Each year, we incur expenses to add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing. We maintain insurance coverage for certain types of cybersecurity incidents, but there can be no assurance that coverage will exist or be adequate to cover potential losses. In 2014, we incurred a loss of $205 thousand related to an unauthorized ACH transaction that occurred at another bank. Also in 2014, we recovered this loss, net of deductible, from our insurer. A security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nIn February 2013, the Obama administration released an executive order, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the \u201cExecutive Order\u201d), which is focused primarily on government actions to support critical infrastructure owners and operators in protecting their systems and networks from cyber threats. The Executive Order requires the development of risk-based cybersecurity standards, methodologies, procedures and processes, a so-called \u201cCybersecurity Framework,\u201d that can be used voluntarily by critical infrastructure companies to address cyber risks. The Executive Order also will steer certain private sector companies to comply voluntarily with the Cybersecurity Framework. In response to the Executive Order, the FFIEC has published cybersecurity guidance, along with observations from recent cybersecurity assessments. These assessments were conducted with the goal of identifying gaps in the regulators\u2019 examination procedures and training that can be used to strengthen the oversight of cybersecurity readiness. If, as a result of the Executive Order, or otherwise, our regulators were to recommend guidance that required us to further implement cyber security infrastructure, we could incur additional costs.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the conduct of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated by several governmental agencies. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders and other creditors. These regulations affect lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. For example, federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations limit the manner in which the Bank may offer and extend credit. In addition, the laws governing bankruptcy generally favor debtors, making it more expensive and more difficult to collect from customers who become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws to further regulate the financial services industry. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, which has resulted, and will continue to result, in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous provisions that affect all banks and bank holding companies, including provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022\nchange the assessment base for the DIF from the amount of insured deposits to total consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling on the size of the DIF, and increase the floor of the size of the DIF, which generally will require an increase in the level of assessments for institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion;\n\u2022\nrepeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby generally permitting the payment of interest on all deposit accounts;\n\u2022\ncentralize responsibility for promulgating regulations under and enforcing federal consumer financial protection laws in a new bureau, the CFPB, that will have direct supervision and examination authority over banks with more than $10 billion in assets;\n\u2022\nrequire the FDIC to seek to make its capital requirements for banks counter-cyclical;\n\u2022\nimpose comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself;\n\u2022\nimplement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders, that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions;\n\u2022\nestablish new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages; and\n\u2022\npermit the Federal Reserve to prescribe regulations regarding interchange transaction fees, and limit them to an amount reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction in question.\nMany of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to regulatory rule-making and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known. Although we cannot predict the specific impact and long-term effects that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will have on us and our prospects, our target markets and the financial industry more generally, we believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will impose additional administrative burdens that will obligate us to incur additional costs.\nChanges to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could, among other things, subject us to additional costs and lower revenues, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, and require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention. Failure to comply with statutes, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or reputational damage, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nBankCap Partners is a bank holding company that is deemed to be a multi-bank holding company for two institutions.\nUnder the Federal Reserve guidelines, every bank holding company must serve as a \u201csource of strength\u201d for each of their bank subsidiaries. Currently, BankCap Partners is deemed a bank holding company for Atlantic Capital Bank, an Atlanta, Georgia-based bank, and the Bank. The position of BankCap Partners as a source of strength to other depository institutions may limit its ability to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s ability to access resources of BankCap Partners. Federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiary, if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to any other financial institution as to which BankCap Partners is deemed to be a bank holding company.\nA bank for which BankCap Partners is deemed to be a bank holding company may be required to indemnify, or cross-guarantee, the FDIC against losses the FDIC incurs with respect to any other bank controlled by BankCap Partners. In addition, the FDICIA requires that an insured depository institution shall be liable for the loss incurred or anticipated by the FDIC arising from the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. Accordingly, the Bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to Atlantic Capital Bank, as well as any other financial institution for which BankCap Partners is deemed to be a bank holding company as a result of its future acquisition activity, if any. Any financial assistance that the Bank is required to provide would reduce our capital and could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While our management\u2019s assessment included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 did not identify any material weaknesses, we cannot guarantee that we will not have any material weaknesses identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm in the future.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act includes a provision to permanently exempt non-accelerated filers from complying with the requirements of Section 404(b), which requires an issuer to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K an attestation report from the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm on the issuer\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Since we were a non-accelerated filer as of June 30, 2014 (the last day of our most recently completed second quarter), we are not required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. However, if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals $75 million or more as of the end of the last day of our most recently completed second quarter, we will be required to provide an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year in which we equal or exceed the $75 million threshold.\nCompliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming. If, in the future, we fail to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if our management or independent registered public accounting firm expresses a qualified or otherwise negative opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential shareholders and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which we summarize in \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies,\u201d describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates about the future that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. For example, material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of our allowance for loan and lease losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, and the application of acquisition accounting principles relating to acquisitions. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events could have a material impact on the accuracy of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and ultimately negatively affect our net income.\nThe market value of our investments may decline, which could cause a decline in our shareholders\u2019 equity and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have designated a portion of our investment portfolio as securities available for sale pursuant to applicable accounting standards relating to accounting for investments. These standards require that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio be reflected as a separate item in shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2014, we had $64.3 million, or 7.0% of our total assets, in securities available for sale at fair value. Shareholders\u2019 equity reflects the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, of these investments. A portion of our investment portfolio is designated as securities held to maturity pursuant to applicable accounting standards. As of December 31, 2014, we had $9.3 million in held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost; any unrealized gains or losses in our held-to-maturity securities do not result in an adjustment to our shareholders\u2019 equity. Management believes that several factors will affect the market values of our investment securities portfolio. These include changes in interest rates or expectations of changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation, the slope of the interest rate yield curve (i.e., the differences between shorter-term and longer-term interest rates) and reduced investor demand. The decline in the market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio results in a corresponding decline in shareholders\u2019 equity. Lower market values for our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities may result in recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge to our net income, thus also reducing our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and we may never pay, or legally be able to pay, dividends.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and we presently do not intend to pay any dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future. We are a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through the Bank. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock will depend primarily up the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the Bank. The company and the Bank are limited in the amount of dividends that they may pay pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations. See \u201cItem 1 - Our Business-Supervision and Regulation-Payment of Cash Dividends.\u201d The terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock also impose limits on our ability to pay dividends. During 2014, we entered into an agreement with a national bank that provides for an unsecured senior term loan credit facility up to $15 million. This agreement also imposes restrictions on the ability of the company and the Bank to pay dividends while any event of default exists. Any future financing arrangements that we enter into may also limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Accordingly, we may never legally be able to pay dividends to our shareholders of common stock. Further, even if we have earnings and available cash in an amount sufficient to pay dividends to our shareholders of common stock, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may decide to retain them and therefore not pay dividends in the future.\nBankCap Partners owns a significant number of shares of our common stock, which will enable it to influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, BankCap Partners beneficially owned 3,671,500 shares of our common stock (including warrants to purchase 391,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.49 per share, all of which warrants are currently exercisable), representing a 27.6% beneficial ownership of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, under the terms of the investor rights agreement, BankCap Partners and all of the former directors and executive officers of Xenith Corporation who became directors and executive officers of Xenith Bankshares and who purchased shares of Xenith Corporation common stock in its June 2009 private offering agreed to vote their shares of our common stock in favor of (1) one designee of BankCap Partners for election to our board of directors for so long as BankCap Partners is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, with respect to Xenith Bankshares, and (2) one additional designee of BankCap Partners for election to our board of directors for so long as BankCap Partners and its affiliates own 25% or more of our outstanding voting capital stock. They have also agreed to vote their shares of our common stock in favor of (1) removing the designee of BankCap Partners on our board of directors at the request of BankCap Partners and the election to our board of directors of a substitute designee of BankCap Partners, and (2) ensuring that any vacancy on our board of directors caused by resignation, removal or death of a BankCap Partners designated director is filled in accordance with the agreement above. Scott A. Reed, a principal of BankCap Partners and a member of our board of directors, is a current designee of BankCap Partners.\nAccordingly, BankCap Partners, through its beneficial ownership of our common stock and board rights, will be able to participate in matters that come before our board of directors and influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to the amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of BankCap Partners may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and BankCap Partners could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders.", "PERMNO": 90295, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "XBKS.1"}
