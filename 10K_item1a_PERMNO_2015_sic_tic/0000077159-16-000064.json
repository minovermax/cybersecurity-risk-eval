{"cik": "77159", "company": "PENN VIRGINIA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 billion of debt outstanding. We will be required to pay interest on our senior notes in the amount of $87.6 million in 2016, including $10.9 million in April 2016 and $32.9 million in May 2016. Our ability to make those payments is severely in doubt. In 2015, we incurred a loss from operations of $1.6 billion, including an impairment charge of $1.4 billion. As of March 11, 2016, we had only $32.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to the Revolver dated as of March 15, 2016, or the Eleventh Amendment, the commitments under the Revolver were reduced to $171.8 million, which is equal to our currently outstanding loans ($170 million) and issued letters of credit ($1.8 million) under the Revolver. Because we do not have any unused commitment capacity, we will not be able to draw on the Revolver to pay our second quarter interest payments on our senior notes or for any other purpose. Furthermore, we are required, at the time of borrowing and as a condition to borrowing, to make certain representations to our lenders. We may not currently be able to make these representations, nor is it likely that we will be able to do so in the future unless we can restructure our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure our debt obligations. While we will attempt to take appropriate mitigating actions to refinance any indebtedness prior to its maturity or to otherwise extend the maturity dates, and to cure any potential defaults under the agreements governing such debt, there is no assurance that any particular action or actions with respect to refinancing existing indebtedness, extending the maturity of existing indebtedness or curing potential defaults in our debt agreements will be sufficient.\nMoreover, our lenders may in the future exercise their right to redetermine our $275 million borrowing base under the Revolver. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, any such redetermination will not occur until after May 15, 2016. If our borrowing base is redetermined below the amount of our outstanding borrowings, a deficiency will result, and any deficiency must be repaid within 60 days. For additional information regarding the Eleventh Amendment, please see Item 9B, \u201cOther Information.\u201d\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe audit report we received with respect to our year-end 2015 consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d The Revolver requires us to deliver audited, consolidated financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or exception. As a result, we are in default under the Revolver. Our failure to obtain relief from this requirement under the Revolver could result in an acceleration of all of our outstanding debt obligations.\nUnder the Revolver, we are required to deliver audited, consolidated financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification or exception. The audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Therefore, we are in default under the Revolver. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, we have received an agreement from our lenders that such default, together with certain other defaults, will not become events of default under the Revolver until April 12, 2016 (which can be further extended until May 10, 2016 if certain conditions have been satisfied). For additional information regarding the Eleventh Amendment, please see Item 9B, \u201cOther Information.\u201d If we do not obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the Revolver prior to the expiration of the extension, there will exist an event of default under the Revolver.\nIf an event of default occurs under the Revolver, the lenders could accelerate the loans outstanding under the Revolver. In addition, if the lenders under the Revolver accelerate the loans outstanding under the Revolver, there will also be cross-defaults under the indentures related to our 7.25% Senior Notes due 2019, or the 2019 Senior Notes, and our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes. If these cross-defaults occurred, the holders of the 2019 Senior Notes or the 2020 Senior Notes could accelerate those notes.\nIf our lenders or our noteholders accelerate the payment of amounts outstanding under the Revolver, the 2019 Senior Notes or the 2020 Senior Notes, respectively, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay such indebtedness and would need additional sources of capital to do so. We could attempt to obtain additional sources of capital from asset sales, public or private issuances of debt, equity or equity-linked securities, debt for equity swaps, or any combination thereof. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in obtaining capital from such transactions on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital to repay the outstanding indebtedness and provide sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs, it may be necessary for us to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or Chapter 11.\nIf we cannot obtain sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to continue with our historical business strategy.\nOur business strategy has historically included maintaining a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed, which could adversely affect our operating results and prospects. If we cannot raise the capital required to implement our historical business strategy, we may be required to curtail operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we can obtain relief from our lenders, we will also be in breach of certain financial covenants under the Revolver during 2016.\nOur ability to borrow under the Revolver is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants, including leverage and current ratios. While we were in compliance with the leverage covenant at December 31, 2015, based on our current operating forecast and capital structure, we do not believe that we will be able to comply with the leverage covenant during the next twelve months. Furthermore, we classified all of our debt as current as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a breach of the current ratio covenant under the Revolver. Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, we have received an agreement from our lenders that such default under the Revolver, together with certain other defaults, will not become events of default until April 12, 2016 (which can be further extended until May 10, 2016 if certain conditions have been satisfied). For additional information regarding the Eleventh Amendment, please see Item 9B, \u201cOther Information.\u201d If we do not obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the Revolver prior to expiration of the extension, there will exist an event of default under the Revolver. Even if we obtain such a waiver or other relief, we still believe we cannot comply with the leverage covenant during the next twelve months. If we cannot obtain from our lenders a waiver of such potential breach or an amendment of the leverage covenant, our breach would constitute an event of default that could result in an acceleration of substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness. We would not have sufficient capital to satisfy these obligations.\nWe may seek protection from our creditors under Chapter 11 or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and could place our shareholders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in our shares.\nWe have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure our indebtedness in private transactions. However, if our attempts are unsuccessful or we are unable to complete such a restructuring on satisfactory terms, we may choose to pursue a filing under Chapter 11.\nSeeking bankruptcy court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For as long as a Chapter 11 proceeding continued, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing on our business operations. Bankruptcy court protection also could make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our customers and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and could seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nAdditionally, all of our indebtedness is senior to the existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that seeking bankruptcy court protection under a Chapter 11 proceeding could cause the shares of our existing common stock to be canceled, resulting in a limited recovery, if any, for shareholders of our common stock, and would place shareholders of our common stock at significant risk of losing all of their investment in our shares.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and potential to seek restructuring transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity issues and efforts to negotiate restructuring transactions may result in uncertainty about our business and cause, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties to lose confidence in our ability to explore and produce oil and natural gas, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining, attracting or replacing key employees;\n\u2022\nemployees to be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities;\n\u2022\nour suppliers, vendors, hedge counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nContinued depressed commodity prices have hurt our profitability, financial condition and ability to service our debt as a result of which we have taken several steps to conserve capital which could further adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur revenues, operating results, cash flows, profitability, growth rate, value of oil and gas properties and ability to service debt depend heavily on prevailing market prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Average monthly WTI crude oil and natural gas prices have decreased approximately 75 percent and 53 percent from June 2014 to January 2016. These decreases have led us to take steps to conserve capital by, among other things, suspending our drilling operations, completing reductions in force and extending the time for payment of our service providers. While we intend to resume drilling in 2016, there can be no assurance that we will have adequate capital to do so. Likewise, while we intend to pay all amounts due to our service providers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that our service providers will not decline to work for us or take action against us for non-payment. Furthermore, the lag in operations and reductions in force which we have completed could have an adverse impact on our continuing employees, making it difficult for us to retain their services.\nPrices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control.\nPrices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign consumer demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil or gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting nations to agree upon and maintain production constraints and oil price controls;\n\u2022\noverall domestic and foreign economic conditions;\n\u2022\nprices and availability of, and demand for, alternative fuels;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nspeculation by investors in oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing, refining and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxation.\nOur future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nUnless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operating activities. We must make substantial capital expenditures to find, acquire, develop and produce oil and gas reserves. Because of significantly low commodity prices, we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves with our cash flows from operating activities. Because of our financial and liquidity positions, external sources of capital are limited.\nOur common stock has been delisted from the NYSE and will not be listed on any other national securities exchange in the near future.\nWe received notice from the NYSE that trading of our common stock was suspended at the opening of business on January 12, 2016, and the NYSE filed with the SEC to remove our common stock from listing and registration on the NYSE. As a result, our common stock now trades in the OTC Pink market under the ticker symbol \u201cPVAH.\u201d Securities traded in the OTC Pink market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market\u2019s perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nExploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nOil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reserves will be found. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\nelevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\ncosts, shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, crews, equipment and materials;\n\u2022\nshortages in experienced labor;\n\u2022\nsurface access restrictions;\n\u2022\nfailure to or delays in securing necessary regulatory approvals and permits, including delays due to potential hydraulic fracturing regulations;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blow-outs and surface cratering; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nThe prevailing prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs, production equipment and related services. The availability of drilling rigs and equipment can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand, an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region.\nThe wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or gas is present or may be produced economically. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. In addition, limitations on the use of hydraulic fracturing could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and produce oil and gas from new wells, which would reduce our rate of return on these wells and our cash flows. Drilling activities can result in dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling costs.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful, nor can we be sure that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular area will not decline. Unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify. Although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations, we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from all of them.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and nonpayment or nonperformance by these parties would reduce our cash flows.\nWe are subject to risk from loss resulting from our customers\u2019 nonperformance or nonpayment. We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. The concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in economic or other conditions within our industry and may accordingly affect our overall credit risk. Recently, many of our customers\u2019 equity values have substantially declined. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us. In 2015, approximately 64 percent of our total consolidated product revenues resulted from three of our customers. Any nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers would reduce our cash flows.\nWe participate in oil and gas leases with third parties and these third parties may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest under joint venture arrangements. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one party. We could be held liable for joint venture obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of the other working interest owners. In addition, the volatility in commodity prices and currently depressed commodity environment increases the likelihood that some of these working interest owners may not be able to fulfill their joint venture obligations. Some of our project partners have experienced liquidity and cash flow problems. These problems have led and may lead our partners to continue to attempt to delay the pace of project development in order to preserve cash. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs. In some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team.\nOur business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on gathering, processing, refining and transportation facilities owned by others.\nWe deliver substantially all of our oil and gas production through pipelines and trucks that we do not own. The marketability of our production depends upon the availability, proximity and capacity of these pipelines and trucks, as well as gathering systems, gas processing facilities and downstream refineries. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells, the reduction in wellhead pricing or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Federal, state and local regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather, process, refine and market our oil and gas.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to conduct the drilling and completion operations on properties we operate.\nWhere we are the operator of a property, we rely on third-party service providers to perform necessary drilling and completion operations. The ability of third-party service providers to perform such drilling and completion operations will depend on those service providers\u2019 ability to compete for and retain qualified personnel, financial condition, economic performance, and access to capital, which in turn will depend upon the supply and demand for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors. The failure of a third-party service provider to adequately perform operations could delay drilling or completion, reduce production from the property or cause other damage to operations, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. While we seek to actively manage our leasehold inventory through drilling wells to hold the leasehold acreage that we believe is material to our operations, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change and subject to the availability of capital.\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows are not precise.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. These estimates are dependent on many variables and, therefore, changes often occur as these variables evolve and commodity prices fluctuate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nActual future production, crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed by us. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 25 percent of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped, compared to 60 percent at December 31, 2014. Estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is based on volumetric calculations and adjacent reserve performance data. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Production revenues from proved developed non-producing reserves will not be realized until sometime in the future. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, these estimated costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not occur as estimated.\nThe reserve estimation standards provide that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. These standards may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not develop those reserves within the required five-year time frame or cannot demonstrate that we could do so. We experienced negative revisions of 45.6 MMBOE in 2015 due to fewer locations, lower EURs and lower prices compared to year-end 2014.\nYou should not assume that the present value of estimated future net cash flows (standardized measure) referred to herein is the current fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual current and future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. As a result, net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the SEC estimate that is provided herein. Actual future net cash flows may also be affected by the amount and timing of actual production, availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves, supply and demand for oil and gas, increases or decreases in consumption of oil and gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for us.\nWe may record impairment losses on our oil and gas properties.\nQuantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence in the period of assessment. Lower crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all reserves within such fields, thus reducing proved property reserve estimates. If such revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves occur, it will have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD&A, on the affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher DD&A expense. The revisions may also be significant enough to result in impairment losses on certain properties that would further decrease reported earnings.\nGAAP requires that the carrying value of oil and gas properties be reviewed on a periodic basis for possible impairment. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value of oil and gas properties is greater than the undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to the property. In addition to revisions to reserves and the impact of lower commodity prices, impairments may occur due to increases in estimated operating and development costs and other factors.\nDuring the past several years, we have been required to impair certain of our oil and gas properties and related assets. We recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion during 2015. We could experience additional impairments in the future. While an impairment charge reflects our ability to recover the carrying value of our investments, it does not impact our cash flows from operating activities.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nIn 2015, other companies operated approximately 15 percent of our net production. Our success in properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including timing and amount of capital expenditures, the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources, approval of other participants in drilling wells, selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs.\nOur property acquisitions carry significant risks.\nAcquisition of oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production. Competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense. In the event we do complete an acquisition, its success will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the purchase price, future crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves, future operating and capital costs, results of future exploration, exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves, actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. A customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited.\nIntegrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks. These risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results, and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nProperties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them.\nOur initial technical reviews of properties we acquire are necessarily limited because an in-depth review of every individual property involved in each acquisition generally is not feasible. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems, such as soil or ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties, and such risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a relatively small company and therefore may not be able to compete effectively.\nCompared to many of our competitors in the oil and gas industry, we are a small company. We face difficulties in competing with larger companies. The costs of doing business in the exploration and production industry, including such costs as those required to explore new oil and natural gas plays, to acquire new acreage, and to develop attractive oil and natural gas projects, are significant. We face intense competition in all areas of our business from companies with greater and more productive assets, substantially larger staffs and greater financial and operating resources than we have. Our limited size has placed us at a disadvantage with respect to funding our capital and operating costs, and means that we are more vulnerable to commodity price volatility and overall industry cycles, are less able to absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations, and that poor results in any single exploration, development or production play can have a disproportionately negative impact on us.\nWe also compete for people, including experienced geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals. Our limited size has placed us at a disadvantage with respect to attracting and retaining management and other professionals with the technical abilities necessary to successfully operate our business.\nOur lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major contiguous area.\nOur current business is focused primarily in the Eagle Ford in South Texas. Due to the concentrated nature of our business activities, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that are more diversified. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of crude oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex environmental laws. Future laws or regulations, any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or a failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, environmental protection and taxation. Our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water. In the event of environmental violations, we may be charged with remedial costs and land owners may file claims for alternative water supplies, property damage or bodily injury. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may, in some circumstances, result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault. In addition, pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. These liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nOur business involves many operating risks, including hydraulic fracturing, that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the exploitation, development and exploration for and the production and transportation of oil and gas, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing. These operating risks include:\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts, cratering and casing collapses;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022\nmigration of fracturing fluids into surrounding groundwater;\n\u2022\nspills or releases of fracturing fluids including from trucks sometimes used to deliver these materials;\n\u2022\nspills or releases of brine or other produced water that may go off-site;\n\u2022\nsubsurface conditions that prevent us from (i) stimulating the planned number of stages, (ii) accessing the entirety of the wellbore with our tools during completion or (iii) removing all fracturing-related materials from the wellbore to allow production to begin;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills and discharges of toxic gases; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and other adverse weather conditions, terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches.\nAny of these risks could result in substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damages, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own, lease or operate. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses.\nIf we experience any problems with well stimulation and completion activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, our ability to explore for and produce oil or natural gas may be adversely affected. We could incur substantial losses or otherwise fail to realize reserves in particular formations as a result of:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with environmental and other governmental or regulatory requirements, which may include limitations on hydraulic fracturing or the discharge of GHGs;\n\u2022\nthe need to shut down, abandon and relocate drilling operations;\n\u2022\nthe need to sample, test and monitor drinking water in particular areas and to provide filtration or other drinking water supplies to users of water supplies that may have been impacted or threatened by potential contamination from fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nthe need to modify drill sites to ensure there are no spills or releases off-site and to investigate and/or remediate any spills or releases that might have occurred; or\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance at a level that balances the cost of insurance with our assessment of the risk and our ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on our investments. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities or that we will purchase insurance against all possible losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured or indemnified against, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAccess to water to conduct hydraulic fracturing may not be available if water sources become scarce.\nThe availability of water is crucial to conduct hydraulic fracturing. A significant amount of water is necessary for drilling and completing each well with hydraulic fracturing in Texas. In the past, Texas has experienced severe droughts that have limited the water supplies that are necessary to conduct hydraulic fracturing. Although we have taken measures to secure our water supply, we can make no assurances that sufficient water resources will be available in the short or long term to carry out our current activities.\nOur production may not satisfy the minimum gross volume requirements under our gathering agreements with Republic Midstream, LLC, or Republic, and, as a result, we may be required to make deficiency payments.\nWe have entered into a gathering agreement with Republic that requires us to provide a minimum delivery commitment of 15,000 gross BOPD of crude oil. The commitment is for a 10 year term beginning once the system has been constructed and is operational, currently expected in the first half of 2016. Although our production and reserves are currently sufficient to fulfill the delivery commitment under the agreement, future oil production may not be sufficient to meet the minimum volume requirements. If we do not purchase volumes in the market or make other arrangements to satisfy the commitments, we would be required to make deficiency payments that total $1.75 per undelivered Bbl.\nLaws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, the EPA implemented rules requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States for emissions occurring after January 1, 2010. In October 2015 the EPA released a final rule adding reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.\nMoreover, the Obama administration has announced in its Climate Action Plan that it intends to adopt additional regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs in the coming years, likely including further restrictions on emissions of methane from oil and gas operations. More specifically, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules in August 2015 that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, and has proposed New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nIn addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a more complete discussion of environmental laws and regulations intended to address climate change and their impact on our business and operations, please see \u201cBusiness - Environmental Regulation - Climate Change.\u201d\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nThe practice of hydraulic fracturing has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into prospective rock formations to stimulate oil and gas production. We use this completion technique on all of our wells. The EPA is studying the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and its potential impact on drinking water resources. The EPA released a draft report in June 2015, which stated that EPA had not found evidence of widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing operations. This report has not yet been finalized, and the EPA\u2019s ultimate conclusions may be impacted by recent comments from the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board regarding the sufficiency of the data underlying some of the EPA\u2019s conclusions. In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the collection of information on various chemicals and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has issued final rules under the CAA that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAP, programs. The EPA has proposed additional NSPS regulations of volatile organic compound and methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, and has released draft guidance that could potentially extend such requirements to existing oil and gas sources in ozone non-attainment areas.\nIn light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, some states and local governments have enacted legislation or adopted regulations, and the U.S. Congress and other states are considering enacting legislation or adopting regulations, that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, monitoring, well construction and water use requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations.\nIndividually or collectively, such new legislation or regulation could result in increased compliance and operating costs, delays or additional operating restrictions. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. While we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations, these requirements may result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations, any of which could be significant.\nIf the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife or their habitat may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nVarious federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that harm endangered or threatened species and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act, CERCLA and the OPA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling, construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, may seek criminal penalties.\nDerivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the sale of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, we periodically enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our hedges are limited in duration, usually for periods of two years or less. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains if crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements. In trying to maintain an appropriate balance, we may end up hedging too much or too little, depending upon how crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future.\nIn addition, derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or\n\u2022\na sudden, unexpected event materially impacts crude oil, NGL or natural gas prices.\nIn addition, derivative instruments involve basis risk. Basis risk in a derivative contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. For example, a NYMEX index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur ability to utilize U.S. net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is subject to various limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The utilization of such carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain ownership changes, including the purchase or sale of our stock by 5% shareholders and our offering of stock during any three-year period resulting in an aggregate change of more than 50% in our beneficial ownership. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that can be offset by these carryforwards. As of December 31, 2015, we do not believe that an ownership change has occurred; however, to the extent an ownership change has occurred or were to occur in the future, it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre-ownership change losses could cause a significant net increase in our U.S. federal income tax liability and could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\nFuture legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Additionally, future federal or state legislation may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction.\nPotential legislation, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U. S. production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income and state income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes states impose on oil and natural gas extraction. Moreover, President Obama has proposed, as part of the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2017, to impose an \u201coil fee\u201d of $10.25 on a per barrel equivalent of crude oil. This fee would be collected on domestically produced and imported petroleum products. The fee would be phased in evenly over five years beginning October 1, 2016. The adoption of this, or similar proposals, would result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, other oil and gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA cyber incident could result in theft of confidential information, data corruption or operational disruption.\nThe oil and gas industry is dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. Software programs are used for, among other things, reserve estimates, seismic interpretation, modeling and compliance reporting. In addition, the use of mobile communication is widespread. Increasingly, we must protect our business against potential cyber incidents including attacks.\nIf our systems for protecting against cyber incidents prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by unauthorized access to our digital systems which could result in theft of confidential information, data corruption or operational disruption. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective systems or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 61955, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PVAC"}
