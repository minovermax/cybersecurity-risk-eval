{"cik": "1647509", "company": "Forest City Realty Trust, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIncluded below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our access to liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES AND SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM\nWe Are Exploring and Evaluating Potential Strategic Alternatives and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Be Successful In Identifying or Completing Any Strategic Alternative, That Any Such Strategic Alternative Will Result In Additional Value For Our Stockholders or That the Process Will Not Have an Adverse Impact On Our Business\nOn September 11, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, together with management and in consultation with financial and legal advisors, has commenced a process to review and consider a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, which could result in, among other things, an accelerated and enhanced operating plan, a sale, a merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture or acquisitions, partnering or other collaboration agreements, potential acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or continuing to operate with our current business plan and strategy. However, there can be no assurance that this process will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, market conditions, industry trends, consent rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or other rights granted to or held by our joint venture partners or other third parties, affiliates or agents, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nThere is no timetable for the completion of the process of exploring strategic alternatives and the process may be disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the process, or any resulting transaction, could divert the attention of management and the Board of Directors from our business, could negatively impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate Board members, key employees or business partners, and could expose us to potential litigation. We expect to incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives.\nNo decision has been made with respect to any transaction and we cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. We do not intend to comment regarding the progress or status of the review process unless we determine that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nShareholder Activism Efforts Could Cause a Material Disruption to Our Business\nWe recently received communications and inquiries from investors regarding the governance and strategic direction of our Company. Investors could take steps to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of our Company. Such investor activism could result in uncertainty of the direction of the Company, substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, hinder execution of our business strategy and initiatives, create adverse volatility in the market price of our common stock, and make it difficult to attract, retain and motivate Board members, key employees and business partners.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STATUS AS A REIT\nIf We Fail to Qualify as a REIT, We Would Be Subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax as a Regular C Corporation and Would Not be Able to Deduct Distributions to Stockholders When Computing Our Taxable Income\nWe have been operating, and plan to continue operating, in a manner consistent with REIT qualification rules; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify as a REIT. Determining whether we qualify as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), to our operations for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable regulations that have been promulgated under the Code is greater in the case of an entity holding assets through an operating partnership, as we do. In addition, determining whether we qualify as a REIT will involve numerous factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:\n\u2022\nwe will not be allowed to deduct our distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n\u2022\nwe will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates; and\n\u2022\nunless we are entitled to relief under the Code, we would be disqualified from qualifying as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.\nAny such corporate tax liability may require us to borrow funds or liquidate some investments to pay any such additional tax liability, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock.\nAlthough we intend to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause us to revoke or lose our REIT status, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy or pay a dividend.\nEven if We Remain Qualified as a REIT, Certain of Our Business Activities Will Be Subject To Corporate Level Income Tax and Foreign Taxes, Which Will Continue to Reduce Our Cash Flows, and Will Have Potential Deferred and Contingent Tax Liabilities\nEven if we remain qualified as a REIT:\n\u2022\nWe are subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. We could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We hold certain of our assets and operations and receive certain items of income through TRSs. The primary non-REIT qualified businesses held in TRSs include 461 Dean Street, an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York, South Bay Galleria (sold in December 2017), Antelope Valley Mall (sold in January 2018), Mall at Robinson (sold in February 2018) and Charleston Town Center, regional malls in Redondo Beach, California, Palmdale, California, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Charleston, West Virginia, respectively, Pacific Park Brooklyn project, land development operations, Barclays Center arena (sold in January 2016), the Nets (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016). Those TRS assets and operations continue to be subject, as applicable, to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes. In addition, we may incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our cash available for distributions to stockholders.\n\u2022\nWe will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 35% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 21% for subsequent years) on all or a portion of the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally, five years) after the effective date of our REIT election, to the extent of the built-in gain based on the fair market value of those assets held by us on the effective date of our REIT election in excess of our then tax basis in those assets. The same rules would apply to any assets we acquire from a C corporation in a carryover basis transaction with built-in gain at the time of the acquisition by us. This gain can be offset by any remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards. Furthermore, if we choose to dispose of any assets within the specified period, we will attempt to utilize various tax planning strategies, including Section 1031 of the Code like-kind exchanges, to mitigate the exposure to the built-in-gains tax. Gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax.\n\u2022\nIf we make a technical or inadvertent mistake regarding whether certain items of our income satisfy either or both of the Code\u2019s REIT gross income tests and, as a result, failed either or both such tests (and did not lose our status as a REIT because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect), we would be subject to corporate level tax on the income that does not meet the Code\u2019s REIT gross income test requirements. Any such taxes we pay will reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\u2022\nThe IRS and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years of the Company prior to January 1, 2016, in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any.\nFailure to Make Sufficient Distributions Would Jeopardize Our Qualification as a REIT and/or Would Subject Us to U.S. Federal Income and Excise Taxes\nA company must distribute to its stockholders with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of its taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gain and net of any available net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d)) in order to qualify as a REIT, and 100% of its taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gain and net of any available NOLs) in order to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. For these purposes, the non-TRS subsidiaries of a company that qualifies as a REIT will be treated as part of such company and therefore such company will also be required to distribute out the taxable income of such subsidiaries. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.\nGenerally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income. However, we may decide to utilize our existing NOLs, if any, to reduce all or a portion of our taxable income in lieu of making corresponding distributions to our stockholders. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain the proposed quarterly distributions that approximate our taxable income and, as a result, may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the shortfall in distributions or may fail to qualify as a REIT. Our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.\nWe May Be Required to Borrow Funds, Sell Assets, or Raise Equity During Unfavorable Market Conditions to Remain Qualified as a REIT or to Fund Capital Expenditures, Future Growth and Expansion Initiatives\nIn order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. Any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our REIT distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our expected qualification as a REIT and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.\nWhether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. In addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. Depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with certain asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter, we would have to correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to continue to qualify as a REIT. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nBecause, as a REIT, We Must Distribute Substantially All of Our Taxable Income From Our Real Estate Operations to Our Stockholders, We Will Continue to Need Additional Capital to Make New Investments. If Additional Funds Are Not Available on Favorable Terms, or At All, Our Ability to Make New Investments Will Be Impaired and the Issuance of Additional Equity Securities To Raise Funds May Result in Dilution\nIf we distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our stockholders and we desire to make new investments through our Operating Partnership, our business will require a substantial amount of capital. We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of securities senior to our common stock, additional borrowings or other indebtedness, or the issuance of additional securities, including limited partnership interests or other equity. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. This may materially affect our business and ability to grow and may impact the market\u2019s perception of us and the price of our common stock.\nAdditional issuances of equity securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. Although we expect to deploy additional capital in accretive transactions, such additional dilution may reduce your percentage of ownership of the Company and voting percentage.\nOur Cash Distributions Are Not Guaranteed and May Fluctuate\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains.\nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset, in whole or in part, our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We may also have available NOLs that could reduce or substantially eliminate our REIT taxable income, and thus we may not be required to distribute material amounts of cash to remain qualified as a REIT. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to utilize available NOLs to reduce our REIT taxable income. At December 31, 2017, we had a federal NOL carryforward of $76,176,000 available to use on our REIT tax return expiring in the years ending December 31, 2032 through 2036.\nComplying with REIT Qualification Requirements May Limit Our Flexibility or Cause Us to Forego Otherwise Attractive Opportunities Beyond Rental Real Estate Operations\nTo remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be required to make distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Thus, compliance with the requirements to qualify as a REIT may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.\nIn particular, in order to remain qualified as a REIT, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities, securities of any TRS or disregarded entity subsidiary of ours and securities that are qualified real estate assets) generally may not include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities, securities of any TRS or disregarded entity subsidiary of ours and securities that are qualified real estate assets) may consist of the securities of any one issuer. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must remedy the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain limited statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our anticipated status as a REIT. As a result, we may have to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nOwnership and Transfer Limitations Contained in Our Charter May Restrict Stockholders From Acquiring or Transferring Shares\nIn order for us to remain qualified as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock may be owned, directly or indirectly or through application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer \u201cindividuals\u201d (as defined in the Code) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. To facilitate our qualification as a REIT, among other purposes, our charter generally prohibits any person from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% of the value of our outstanding common stock and preferred stock or 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, unless our Board of Directors exempts the person from such ownership limitations. Absent such an exemption from our Board of Directors, the transfer of our stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit, or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the other ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our charter, may be void under certain circumstances, and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares. These provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us, even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in their best interest.\nComplying With the Requirements to Remain Qualified As a REIT May Limit Our Ability to Hedge Effectively and Increase the Cost of Our Hedging, and May Cause Us to Incur Tax Liabilities\nAs a REIT, certain provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge liabilities. Generally, income from hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets will not constitute \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the Code\u2019s REIT gross income tests, provided certain requirements are satisfied. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the Code\u2019s REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in any of our TRSs generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in the applicable TRS.\nWe Have Limited Experience Operating as a Company That Qualifies as a REIT, Which May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Cash Flow and Ability to Satisfy Debt Service Obligations and the Per Share Trading Price of Our Common Stock\nWe began operating in a manner consistent with REIT qualification rules on January 1, 2016. Our senior management team, including the new members of the senior management team who were appointed in connection with our internal reorganization to a new organizational structure, has limited experience operating a corporation that qualifies as a REIT. The experience of our senior management team may not be sufficient to operate the Company successfully and in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT. Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations.\nU.S. Federal Tax Reform Legislation Now and in the Future Could Affect Us, the Geographic Markets in Which We Operate, the Trading of Our Shares and Our Results of Operations, Both Positively and Negatively, in Ways That Are Difficult to Anticipate\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Act\u201d) represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules. So long as we remain a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Act and future tax reform legislation could impact our share price or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in us. For example, the decrease in corporate tax rates in the 2017 Act could decrease the attractiveness of the REIT structure relative to companies that are not organized as REITs. The legislation does, however, permit noncorporate holders of our common stock to deduct an amount equal to 20 percent of certain REIT dividends. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Act do not impact us directly, they could impact the geographic markets in which we operate as well as our tenants in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to anticipate. For example, the limitation in the 2017 Act on the deductibility of certain state and local taxes may make operating in jurisdictions that impose such taxes at higher rates less desirable than operating in jurisdictions imposing such taxes at lower rates. The overall impact of the 2017 Act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities, and it is possible that future guidance could adversely impact us.\nOur Board of Directors May Unilaterally Revoke Our Election to Be Taxed as a REIT, and This May Have Adverse Consequences for Our Stockholders\nOur charter provides that our Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without the approval of our stockholders, if the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we revoke or otherwise terminate our election to be so taxed, we will no longer be required to pay dividends to our stockholders and, if we do continue to pay dividends, we will not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income, and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may adversely impact our total return to our stockholders.\nWe May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits to Stockholders, Including the Achievement of Significant Tax Savings for Us and Regular Distributions to Our Stockholders\nEven if we remain qualified as a REIT, we cannot provide assurance that our stockholders will experience benefits attributable to our qualification and taxation as a REIT, including our ability to reduce our corporate level federal tax through regular distributions to stockholders. The realization of the anticipated benefits to stockholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, future cash distributions to stockholders will depend on our cash flows, as well as the impact of alternative, more attractive investments as compared to dividends. Further, changes in legislation or the federal tax rules could adversely impact the benefits of being a REIT.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY\nLending and Capital Market Conditions May Negatively Impact Our Liquidity and Our Ability to Finance or Refinance Projects or Repay Our Debt\nCurrent U.S. and global economic conditions continue to remain uncertain despite recent improvements. The capital markets have improved from post-recession lows, with banks and permanent lenders originating new loans for real estate projects, particularly as their existing portfolio loans get paid off. Access to bank credit and capital remains open with banks and permanent lenders originating new loans for real estate projects. Lenders continue favoring high quality operating assets in strong markets. While banks continue to originate construction loans for multifamily projects, construction loans for office or retail projects remain difficult to obtain, unless the project has substantial pre-leasing in place or higher than historical equity commitments from the developer. However, in the current financial regulatory environment, limits are beginning to be placed on the overall liquidity in the market for construction loans provided by banks and new loans for commercial mortgage backed securities. Given this impact on market liquidity and for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain financings on terms comparable to those we secured in the past, or at all. Economic conditions during the recession required us to curtail our investment in certain new development opportunities, which negatively impacted our growth. Although we continue to break ground and complete construction projects consisting primarily of apartments in core markets, we remain cautious in investing in new development opportunities and have lowered our level of development activity. If economic conditions begin to trend downwards, and/or if interest rates on new loans rise significantly, we may be required to further curtail our development or expansion projects and potentially write down our investments in some projects.\nCurrent economic conditions are still volatile and could deteriorate, which may impact our ability to refinance our debt and obtain renewals or replacement of credit enhancement devices, such as letters of credit, on favorable terms, or at all. While some of our current financings have extension options, some are contingent upon pre-determined underwriting qualifications. Projects may not meet the required conditions to qualify for such extensions. Our inability to extend, repay or refinance our debt when it becomes due, including upon a default or acceleration event, could result in foreclosure on the properties pledged as collateral, which could result in a loss of our investment. We may be unable to refinance or extend our maturing debt obligations and lenders in certain circumstances may require a higher rate of interest, repayment of a portion of the outstanding principal or additional equity contributions to the project.\nA significant amount of our total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2017 becomes due in each of the next three fiscal years. If these amounts are unable to be refinanced, extended or repaid from other sources, such as sales of properties or the issuance of new equity, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt.\nTotal outstanding debt includes credit enhanced mortgage debt we have obtained for a number of our properties to back the bonds issued by a government authority and then remarketed to the public. Generally, the credit enhancement, such as a letter of credit, expires prior to the terms of the underlying mortgage debt and must be renewed or replaced to prevent acceleration of the underlying mortgage debt. We treat credit enhanced debt as maturing in the year the credit enhancement expires. However, if the credit enhancement is drawn upon due to the inability to remarket the bonds due to reasons including, but not limited to, market dislocation or a downgrade in the credit rating of the credit enhancer, not only would the bonds incur additional interest expense, but the debt maturity could accelerate to as early as 90 days after the acceleration occurs.\nAdditionally, in the event of a failure of a lender or counterparty to a financial contract, obligations under the financial contract might not be honored and many forms of assets may be at risk and may not be fully returned to us. Should a financial institution, particularly a construction lender, fail to fund its committed amounts when contractually obligated, our ability to meet our obligations and complete projects could be adversely impacted.\nThe Ownership, Development and Management of Commercial Real Estate Remains Challenging During the Slow Economic Recovery\nThe current economic environment continues to impact the commercial real estate industry, specifically for retail and office properties. Some commercial tenants are experiencing financial pressure and are continuing to place demands on landlords to provide rent concessions. The financial hardships on some tenants are so severe that they may leave the market entirely or declare bankruptcy, creating fluctuating vacancy rates in commercial properties. The tenants in good financial condition may consider offers from competing projects and wait for the best possible deal before committing, which may also create fluctuating vacancy rates and cause us to lower rental rates in order to remain competitive.\nWe Are Subject to Risks Associated with Investments in Real Estate\nThe value of, and our income from, our properties may decline due to circumstances that adversely affect real estate generally and those specific to our properties. General factors that may adversely affect our real estate portfolios, if they were to occur or continue, include:\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nThe availability of financing, including refinancing or extensions of our nonrecourse mortgage debt maturities, on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nA decline in the economic conditions at the national, regional or local levels, particularly a decline in one or more of our core markets;\n\u2022\nDecreases in rental rates;\n\u2022\nAn increase in competition for tenants and customers or a decrease in demand by tenants and customers;\n\u2022\nThe financial condition of tenants, including the extent of bankruptcies and defaults;\n\u2022\nAn increase in supply of or decrease in demand for our property types in our core markets;\n\u2022\nDeclines in consumer confidence and spending that adversely affect our revenue from our retail centers;\n\u2022\nDeclines in housing markets in Stapleton, Colorado that adversely affect our land sales revenue from our Development segment;\n\u2022\nThe adoption on the national, state or local level of more restrictive laws and governmental regulations, including more restrictive zoning, land use or environmental regulations and increased real estate taxes; and\n\u2022\nOpposition from local community or political groups with respect to the development, construction or operations at a particular site.\nIn addition, there are factors that may adversely affect the value of specific operating properties or result in reduced income or unexpected expenses. As a result, we may not achieve our projected returns on the properties and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. Those operational factors include:\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the perceptions of prospective tenants or purchasers of the attractiveness of the property;\n\u2022\nOur inability to provide adequate management and maintenance;\n\u2022\nThe investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials or toxic substances at a site;\n\u2022\nOur inability to collect rent or other receivables;\n\u2022\nVacancies and other changes in rental rates;\n\u2022\nAn increase in operating costs that cannot be passed through to tenants;\n\u2022\nIntroduction of a competitor\u2019s property in, or in close proximity to, one of our current markets;\n\u2022\nUnderinsured or uninsured natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to obtain adequate insurance.\nWe Are Subject to Real Estate Development Risks\nIn addition to the risks described above, our development projects are subject to significant additional risks relating to our ability to complete our projects on time and on budget. Factors that may result in a development project exceeding budget, being delayed or being prevented from completion include:\n\u2022\nAn inability to secure sufficient financing on favorable terms, or at all, including an inability to refinance or extend construction loans;\n\u2022\nConstruction delays or cost overruns, either of which may increase project development costs or lead to impairments;\n\u2022\nAn increase in commodity costs;\n\u2022\nAn inability to obtain zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022\nAn inability to secure tenants or anchors necessary to support the project;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy or sales levels;\n\u2022\nThreatened or pending litigation;\n\u2022\nFailure by partners to fulfill obligations; and\n\u2022\nConstruction stoppages due to labor disputes.\nSome of these development risks were magnified during the recession and continue to be heightened given current uncertain and potentially volatile market conditions. See also \u201cLending and Capital Market Conditions May Negatively Impact Our Liquidity and Our Ability to Finance or Refinance Projects or Repay Our Debt\u201d. If market volatility causes economic conditions to remain unpredictable or to trend downwards, we may not achieve our projected returns on properties under development and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. In addition, the lead time required to develop, construct and lease-up a development property has substantially increased, which could adversely impact our projected returns or result in a termination of the development project.\nIn the past, we have elected not to proceed, or have been prevented from proceeding, with certain development projects, and we anticipate this may occur again. In addition, development projects may be delayed or terminated because a project partner or prospective anchor withdraws, a project partner fails to fulfill contractual obligations or a third party challenges our entitlements or public financing.\nWe periodically serve as either the construction manager or the general contractor for our development projects. The construction of real estate projects entails unique risks, including risks that the project will fail to conform to building plans, specifications and timetables. These failures could be caused by labor strikes, weather, government regulations and other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents occurring during the construction process that are underinsured.\nIn the construction of new projects, we generally guarantee the lien-free completion of the project to the construction loan lender. This guaranty is recourse to us and places the risk of construction delays and cost overruns on us. In addition, from time to time, we guarantee our construction obligations to major tenants and public agencies. These types of guarantees are released upon completion of the project, as defined. We may have significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with our lien-free completion obligations, which could have an adverse impact on our cash flows.\nOur Pacific Park Brooklyn project is currently facing these and other development risks.\n\u2022\nOn June 30, 2014, we entered into a joint venture with Greenland Atlantic Yards, LLC, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based Greenland Holding Group Company Limited (\u201cGreenland\u201d), to develop Pacific Park Brooklyn, a 22 acre mixed-use project in Brooklyn, New York. Under the joint venture, Greenland acquired 70% of the project and co-develops the project with us, along with sharing in the entire project costs going forward in proportion to ownership interests. The joint venture will execute on the remaining development rights, including the infrastructure and vertical construction of the apartment units, but excluded Barclays Center (sold in January 2016) and 461 Dean Street apartment community. Consistent with the approved master plan, the joint venture will develop the remaining portion of Phase I and all of Phase II of the project, including the permanent rail yard. The remaining portion of Phase I that will be developed by the joint venture is comprised of seven buildings totaling approximately 3.1 million square feet. Phase II consists of seven buildings totaling approximately 3.3 million square feet.\nUnder the joint venture with Greenland, the Pacific Park Brooklyn project is managed by a board composed of three representatives from Greenland and two representatives from the Company. While decisions require a majority vote, many decisions labeled \u201cSpecial Major Decisions\u201d require a vote by us for approval. There is the risk that many of the decisions made by the joint venture would not be in our best interests and further, that an inability to agree on certain of the Special Major Decisions would trigger buy-sell rights and obligations between us and Greenland. The exercise of the buy-sell rights could result in our having to fund the purchase of Greenland\u2019s interest in the entire joint venture or in one or more individual parcels. It could also result in having our interests be purchased and the loss of ownership of the Pacific Park Brooklyn project or of one or more parcels thereof.\nOn June 27, 2014, the City of New York and State of New York entities revised certain project requirements with the goal of accelerating the construction of affordable housing. Among the requirements, affordable units are required to constitute 35% of all units for which construction has commenced until 1,050 affordable units have been started, after which the percentage drops to 25%. Failure to meet this requirement will prevent the joint venture from seeking new building permits, as well as give the State the right to seek injunctive relief. Also, temporary certificates of occupancy (\u201cTCOs\u201d) for a total of 2,250 affordable housing units are required to be issued by May 31, 2025 or a $2,000 per unit per month penalty will be imposed for those affordable units which have not received TCOs by such date, until issued.\nThe joint venture broke ground on the first affordable apartment community, 535 Carlton, in December, 2014. In mid-2015, the joint venture commenced construction on two more buildings, 38 Sixth Avenue, an affordable apartment building, and 550 Vanderbilt, a condominium building. From the formation of the joint venture in June 2014 through the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we reviewed the estimates and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model and updated them as necessary.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2016, it became evident the occupancy and rental rate declines in the Brooklyn market were not temporary as a result of an increased supply of new rental product amplified by the sun-setting and the uncertainty around the 421 A real estate tax abatement program. The condominium market in New York has also softened, causing the projected sale schedule for 550 Vanderbilt to be adjusted accordingly. Separately, the construction costs across the New York market continue to trend upward, resulting in increases in the estimated trade costs for certain infrastructure as well as vertical construction. In addition, the expiration of and the continued uncertainty related to the availability of the 421 A real estate tax abatement program puts further stress on anticipated returns. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as part of our formal strategic plan update, a decision was made to revise the overall project schedule for Pacific Park Brooklyn. Accordingly, we updated the discounted cash flow model to reflect the updated timing of the project schedule as well as the revenue, expense and cost assumptions. Based on the above, the estimated fair value of the investment no longer exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $299,300,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining basis in the investment (net of estimated future funding obligations) is not material. See Note S - Impairment of Real Estate and Impairment of Unconsolidated Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nSubstantial additional costs for rail yard and infrastructure improvements, including a platform over the new permanent rail yard, will be required to proceed with Phase II of Pacific Park Brooklyn. More specifically, our agreement with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (\u201cMTA\u201d) requires collateral to be posted and for the construction of the permanent rail yard to be substantially complete by December 2017, subject to force majeure. In 2015, we notified the MTA of a force majeure delay of approximately 16 months, due to unforeseen site conditions. Collateral of $86,000,000 was posted with the MTA, of which our portion was 30%, or approximately $26,000,000, which resulted in an increase to our equity method investment.\nThere is also the potential for increased costs and further delays to the project as a result of (i) increasing construction costs, (ii) scarcity of labor and supplies, (iii) the unavailability of additional needed financing, (iv) our or our partners\u2019 inability or failure to meet required equity contributions, (v) increasing rates for financing, (vi) our inability to meet certain agreed upon deadlines for the development of the project, (vii) other potential litigation seeking to enjoin or prevent the project or litigation for which there may not be insurance coverage and (viii) our or our partners\u2019 inability to fulfill contractual obligations. In addition, as applicable contractual and other deadlines and decision points approach, we could have less time and flexibility to plan and implement our responses to these or other risks to the extent that any of them may actually arise. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in the fair value of our equity method investment to be less than the carrying value, which could result in a future impairment.\nOn January 15, 2018, we reached an agreement with our partner, Greenland USA, on the restructuring of the Pacific Park Brooklyn joint venture. The transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2018, will increase Greenland USA\u2019s ownership interest in the joint venture from 70% to 95% on future vertical construction costs, effective January 15, 2018, and reduce our ownership interest and future obligations to fund future vertical construction costs from 30% to 5%. We will only have one representative on the Board and fewer decision rights. Completed or partially completed projects of the joint venture, including 38 Sixth Ave, 550 Vanderbilt, 535 Carlton and the related parking garages, will remain owned by Greenland USA and us on a 70%/30% basis, respectively, and the construction of the new permanent rail yard will continue to be a 70%/30% obligation. However, there can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated as agreed upon and described above, or at all.\nWe Are Exposed to Litigation Risks Related to the Construction of 461 Dean Street\n461 Dean Street is an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York adjacent to the Barclays Center at the Pacific Park Brooklyn project. This modular construction project opened during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We had a fixed price contract (the \u201cCM Contract\u201d) with Skanska USA to construct the apartment building. In 2014, Skanska USA ceased construction and we terminated the CM Contract for cause. Each party has filed lawsuits relating primarily to the project\u2019s delays and associated additional completion costs. We continue to vigorously pursue legal action against Skanska USA for damages related to its default of the CM Contract. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in recovering these damages or defending against Skanska USA\u2019s claims.\nVacancies in Our Properties May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Fair Value Calculations\nOur results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue leasing a significant portion of our office, retail and apartment real estate portfolio. We depend on office, retail and apartment tenants in order to collect rents and other charges. The current market conditions have impacted our tenants on many levels. Despite improvement in certain economic measures, we believe it will take time for many of our current or prospective tenants to achieve a financial outlook similar to what they had prior to the recession, if ever. The market conditions have been particularly hard on retail tenants, many of whom have announced store closings and scaled back growth plans. If we are unable to sustain historical occupancy levels in our real estate portfolio, our cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our ability to sustain our current and historical occupancy levels also depends on many other factors discussed elsewhere in this section.\nWe Face Risks Associated with Developing and Managing Properties in Partnership with Others\nWe use partnerships and limited liability companies (\u201cLLCs\u201d) to finance, develop or manage some of our real estate investments. Acting through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we typically are a general partner or managing member in these partnerships or LLCs. There are, however, instances in which we do not control or even participate in management or day-to-day operations of these properties. The use of partnerships and LLCs involve special risks associated with the possibility that:\n\u2022\nA partner or member may have interests or goals inconsistent with ours;\n\u2022\nA general partner or managing member may take actions contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives with respect to our real estate investments;\n\u2022\nA partner or a member could experience financial difficulties that prevent it from fulfilling its financial or other responsibilities to the project, or its lender, or the other partners or members; or\n\u2022\nA partner may not fulfill its contractual obligations.\nIn the event any of our partners or members files for bankruptcy, we could be precluded from taking certain actions affecting our project without bankruptcy court approval, which could diminish our control over the project even if we were the general partner or managing member. In addition, if the bankruptcy court were to discharge the obligations of our partner or member, it could result in our ultimate liability for the project being greater than originally anticipated.\nTo the extent we are a general partner, we may be exposed to unlimited liability, which may exceed our investment or equity in the partnership. If one of our subsidiaries is a general partner of a particular partnership, it may be exposed to the same kind of unlimited liability.\nOur Properties and Businesses Face Significant Competition\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive in many of the markets in which we operate. Competition could over-saturate any market and create vacancies or hinder the lease-up at our properties, resulting in an adverse effect to our operations and cash flow which is currently evident in the New York apartment market. As a result, we may not have sufficient cash to meet the nonrecourse debt service requirements on certain of our properties. Although we may attempt to negotiate a restructuring with the mortgagee, we may not be successful, particularly in light of current credit markets, which could cause a property to be transferred to the mortgagee.\nThere are many developers, managers and owners of office, retail and apartment real estate and undeveloped land, as well as other REITs, private real estate companies and investors, that compete with us nationally, regionally and/or locally, some of whom have greater financial resources and market share than us. They compete with us for management and leasing opportunities, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for anchor stores and tenants for properties. The leasing of real estate in particular is highly competitive. The principal means of competition are rent, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased. We may not be able to successfully compete in these areas. If our competitors prevent us from realizing our real estate objectives, the operating performance of our projects may fall short of expectations and adversely affect our financial performance.\nTenants at our retail properties face continual competition in attracting customers from Internet shopping, retailers at other shopping centers, catalogue companies, online merchants, television shopping networks, warehouse stores, large discounters, outlet malls, wholesale clubs, direct mail and telemarketers. Our competitors and those of our tenants could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our retail properties and on the rents we can charge or the concessions we can grant. This in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, and could affect the realizable value of our assets upon sale. Further, as new technologies emerge, the relationship among customers, retailers, and shopping centers are evolving on a rapid basis and it is critical we adapt to such new technologies and relationships on a timely basis. We may be unable to adapt quickly and effectively, which could adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Re-lease Space as Leases Expire\nWhen our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can re-lease the space, the terms of renewal or new lease, taking into account, among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or re-lease space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or re-lease the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or obtaining new leases for the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to security holders could be adversely affected.\nWe May Be Unable to Sell Properties to Reposition Our Portfolio\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may be unable to dispose of underperforming properties and may be unable to reposition our portfolio in response to changes in national, regional or local real estate markets. In addition, potential buyers may be unable to secure financing, which could negatively impact our ability to dispose of our properties. As a result, we may incur operating losses from some of our properties and may have to write down the value of some properties due to impairment. In addition, real estate investments may be relatively difficult to sell quickly. Consequently, we may have limited ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nWe May Be Unable to Transact on Our Chosen Strategic Alternatives for Our Remaining Retail Portfolio\nIn August 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a process to review strategic alternatives for a portion of our retail portfolio. Negotiations with two of our existing partners have resulted in the execution of signed definitive agreements with both QIC and Madison International for the disposition of 10 of our regional mall assets and 12 of our specialty retail assets, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of Shops at Northfield at Stapleton in Denver, Colorado, and South Bay Galleria in Redondo Beach, California which represented the first two regional mall assets to be sold to QIC. Through February 2018, we completed the sale of Antelope Valley Mall in Palmdale, California, and Mall at Robinson in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the third and fourth regional mall sale to QIC. We expect the sale of two additional regional malls to close in the first half of 2018 pending lender and other third-party approvals. The remaining four regional mall assets are expected to close as we secure replacement assets. While we anticipate that the partners will purchase the remaining malls as described above, there can be no assurance that the closings will occur. In particular, in the case of the properties owned in partnership with QIC, there is no contractual requirement that QIC complete the purchases by a particular date or at all, and if QIC elects not to complete the expected purchases, our remedy will be limited to having a right to negotiate for the sale of our interests in those properties to one or more other qualified purchasers. We expect to dispose of the majority of these retail assets in a tax-deferred manner and redeploy the equity from our retail portfolio into apartment and office assets that align with our focus on primarily core markets and urban, mixed-use placemaking projects, including amenity retail.\nIn December 2017, we closed on the conversion of substantially all of our common ownership interest to preferred ownership interest in 10 of the12 specialty retail assets. Closings on the conversion of our common interest in two other centers in the portfolio - Shops at Northern Boulevard and Queens Place - are expected in the first half of 2018 as remaining lender matters are addressed. Final closings on each of the individual specialty retail centers are expected to occur in 2018 as we secure replacement assets into which to redeploy our preferred interest.\nAs we continue to execute on our strategic alternatives for our retail portfolio, we may be required to update our undiscounted cash flow impairment analysis of our equity method investments, including estimated selling prices. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may result in future impairments. There can be no assurance any of the remaining transactions could be consummated in a tax deferred manner, or at all.\nOur Results of Operations and Cash Flows May Be Adversely Affected by Tenant Defaults or Bankruptcy\nOur results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants default on their obligations to us. A default by a tenant may result in the inability for such tenant to re-lease space from us on economically favorable terms, or at all. In the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays in payments and incur substantial costs in recovering our losses.\nIn addition, our ability to collect rents and other charges will be difficult if the tenant is bankrupt or insolvent. Our tenants have from time to time filed for bankruptcy or been involved in insolvency proceedings. We may be required to expense costs associated with leases of bankrupt tenants and may not be able to replace future rents for tenant space rejected in bankruptcy proceedings, which could adversely affect our properties. The current bankruptcies of some of our tenants, and the potential bankruptcies of other tenants in the future, could make it difficult for us to enforce our rights as lessor and protect our investment.\nBased on tenants with contractual rent of greater than 2% as of December 31, 2017, our five largest office tenants by leased square feet are the City of New York, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Anthem, Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and the U.S. Government. Given our large concentration of office space in the Greater New York City metropolitan area, we may be adversely affected by negative events specific to that region.\nWe May Be Negatively Impacted by the Consolidation or Closing of Anchor Stores\nOur retail centers are generally anchored by department stores or other \u201cbig box\u201d tenants. We could be adversely affected if anchor stores were to consolidate, close or enter into bankruptcy. Given the current economic environment for retailers, there is a heightened risk an anchor store could close or enter into bankruptcy. Although non-tenant anchors generally do not pay us rent, they typically contribute towards common area maintenance and other expenses. Even if we own the anchor space, we may be unable to re-lease this area or to re-lease it on comparable terms. The loss of these revenues could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Further, the temporary or permanent loss of any anchor would likely reduce customer traffic in the retail center, which could lead to decreased sales at other retail stores. Rents obtained from other tenants may be adversely impacted as a result of co-tenancy clauses in their leases. In addition, some non-anchor tenants will have the ability to vacate and terminate their leases. One or more of these factors could cause the retail center to fail to meet its debt service requirements. The consolidation of anchor stores may also negatively affect current and future development projects. We may be required to invest additional capital to try to maintain occupancy, attract additional/replacement tenants and to maintain or improve the value of the asset.\nTerrorist Attacks and Other Armed Conflicts May Adversely Affect Our Business\nWe have significant investments in large metropolitan areas, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the greater metropolitan areas of New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C., which face a heightened risk related to terrorism. Some tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their business to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States. This could result in a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. In addition, properties in our real estate portfolio could be directly impacted by future terrorist attacks, which could cause the value of our property and the level of our revenues to significantly decline.\nFuture terrorist activity, related armed conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease and adversely affect mall traffic. Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our revenues, costs and operating results.\nOur High Debt Leverage May Prevent Us from Responding to Changing Business and Economic Conditions\nOur high degree of debt leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. We have a ratio of net debt (consisting of nonrecourse mortgage debt, revolving credit facility, term loan facility and convertible senior debt) to total market capitalization of approximately 35.0% and 39.3% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on our net debt outstanding at that date and the market value of our outstanding common stock. Our high leverage may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and may make us more vulnerable to a prolonged downturn in the economy.\nNonrecourse mortgage debt is collateralized by individual completed rental properties, projects under development and undeveloped land. We do not expect to repay a substantial amount of the principal of our outstanding debt prior to maturity or to have available funds from operations sufficient to repay this debt at maturity. As a result, it will be necessary for us to refinance our debt through new debt financings or through equity offerings. If interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing, our interest expense would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Cash flows and our liquidity would also be adversely affected if we are required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal or contribute additional equity to obtain the refinancing. In addition, in the event we are unable to secure refinancing on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to sell properties on unfavorable terms, which could result in the recognition of losses and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to make the required payments on any debt collateralized by a mortgage on one of our properties or to refinance that debt when it comes due, the mortgage lender could take that property through foreclosure and, as a result, we could lose income and asset value as well as harm our Company reputation.\nOur Corporate Debt Covenants Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition\nWe have guaranteed our Operating Partnership\u2019s obligations under the $600,000,000 Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and $335,000,000 Term Loan Credit Agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility have restrictive covenants, including a prohibition on certain types of disposition, mergers, consolidations, and limitations on lines of business we are allowed to conduct. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Loan Facility contain financial covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum total leverage ratio, maximum secured and unsecured leverage ratios, maximum secured recourse leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio (all as specified in the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility).\nThe failure to comply with any of our financial or non-financial covenants could result in an event of default and accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend upon our future economic performance. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that may be desirable or advantageous to us.\nWe Are Subject to Risks Associated With Hedging Agreements\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including caps to mitigate or reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility or to satisfy lender requirements. These agreements expose us to additional risks, including a risk the counterparties will not perform. Moreover, the hedging agreement may not qualify for hedge accounting or our hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations. Should a hedging agreement prematurely terminate, there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our initial obligation under the hedging agreement.\nWhen a hedging agreement is required under the terms of a mortgage loan, it is often a condition that the hedge counterparty agree to certain conditions which include, but are not limited to, maintaining a specified credit rating. With the volatility in the financial markets and reporting requirements recently adopted by governmental agencies, there is a reduced pool of eligible counterparties that can meet or are willing to agree to the required conditions, which has resulted in an increased cost for hedging agreements. This could make it difficult to enter into hedging agreements in the future. Additionally, if a counterparty fails to satisfy any of the required conditions and we are unable to renegotiate the required conditions with the lender or find an alternative counterparty for such hedging agreements, we could be in default under the loan and the lender could take that property through foreclosure.\nOur bonds that are structured in a total rate of return swap arrangement (\u201cTROR\u201d) have maturities reflected in the year the bond matures as opposed to the TROR maturity date, which is likely to be earlier. Throughout the life of the TROR, if the property is not performing at designated levels or due to changes in market conditions, the property may be obligated to make collateral deposits with the counterparty. At expiration or termination of the TROR arrangement, the property must pay or is entitled to the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the bond and par. If the property does not post collateral or make the counterparty whole at expiration, the counterparty could foreclose on the property.\nAny Rise in Interest Rates Will Increase Our Current and Future Interest Costs\nIncluding the effect of the protection provided by the interest rate swaps, caps and long-term contracts in place as of December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase in taxable interest rates (including corporate debt and the effect of interest rate floors) would increase the annual pre-tax interest cost for the next 12 months of our current outstanding variable-rate debt by approximately $9,171,000 at December 31, 2017. Although tax-exempt rates generally move in an amount smaller than corresponding changes in taxable interest rates, a 100 basis point increase in tax-exempt rates would increase the annual pre-tax interest cost for the next 12 months of our current outstanding tax-exempt variable-rate debt by approximately $6,617,000 at December 31, 2017. This analysis includes a portion of our taxable and tax-exempt variable-rate debt related to construction loans for which the interest expense is capitalized. For variable rate bonds, during times of market illiquidity, a premium interest rate could be charged on the bonds to successfully market them, which would result in even higher interest rates. A rising interest rate environment would increase the cost of and affect our ability to refinance, secure or issue future borrowings on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, rising interest rates may affect our ability to develop, acquire or dispose of real estate at terms favorable to us.\nIf We Are Unable to Obtain Tax-Exempt Financings, Our Interest Costs Would Rise\nWe regularly utilize tax-exempt financings and tax increment financings, which generally bear interest at rates below prevailing rates available through conventional taxable financing. Tax-exempt bonds or similar government subsidized financing may not continue to be available to us in the future, either for new development or acquisitions, or for the refinancing of outstanding debt. Our ability to obtain these financings or to refinance outstanding tax-exempt debt on favorable terms could significantly affect our ability to develop or acquire properties and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDowngrades in Our Credit Rating Could Adversely Affect Our Performance\nWe are periodically rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. Any downgrades in our credit rating could impact our ability to borrow by increasing borrowing costs as well as limiting our access to capital. In addition, a downgrade could require us to post cash collateral and/or letters of credit to cover our self-insured property and liability insurance deductibles, surety bonds, energy contracts and hedge contracts, which would adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\nOur Business Will Be Adversely Impacted Should an Uninsured Loss, a Loss in Excess of Insurance Limits or a Delayed or Denied Insurance Claim Occur\nWe carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, flood, wind, earthquake, California earthquake on California commercial properties (but not on California residential properties) and rental loss (and environmental insurance on certain locations) with respect to our properties within insured limits and policy specifications we believe are customary for similar properties. There are, however, specific types of potential losses, including environmental loss, loss from cyber crimes, loss resulting from the actual or alleged negligence of our employees relating to professional liability, or losses of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from wars, terrorism, hurricanes, wind, earthquakes (including California earthquakes) or other natural disasters, that, in our business judgment, cannot be purchased at a commercially viable cost or whereby such losses, if incurred, would exceed the insurance limits procured. In the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance limits, or a failure by an insurer to meet its obligations under a policy, we could lose both our invested capital in, and anticipated profits from, the affected property and could be exposed to liabilities with respect to that which we thought we had adequate insurance to cover. Any such uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Under our current policies, which have varying expiration dates, our properties are insured against acts of terrorism, subject to various limits, deductibles and exclusions for acts of war and terrorist acts involving biological, chemical and nuclear damage. Once these policies expire, we may not be able to obtain adequate terrorism coverage at a commercially reasonable cost. In addition, our insurers may not be able to maintain reinsurance sufficient to cover any losses we may incur as a result of terrorist acts. As a result, our insurers\u2019 ability to provide future insurance for any damages we sustain as a result of a terrorist attack may be reduced or eliminated or may not be available at a commercially reasonable cost.\nAdditionally, most of our current project mortgages require \u201call-risk\u201d/\u201cspecial form\u201d property insurance, and we may be unable to continue to obtain such \u201call risk\u201d/\u201cspecial form\u201d policies that will satisfy lender requirements. We are self-insured as to the first $500,000 of commercial general liability coverage per occurrence. We may incur losses that exceed this self-insurance.\nAs a property developer, owner, and manager, we will likely experience property and liability claims and will reasonably seek the coverage of the insurance policies we have procured. There may be instances where there are severe and complex claims that can be prolonged and litigated and insurance recoveries may be delayed, partially delayed or ultimately denied in full. This delay or denial may have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe also carry several other types of insurance policies that have various terms and limits where it is available at commercially reasonable terms and prices. However, these may not cover all claims, alleged claims, or actual losses that may potentially occur or are made by various parties against us.\nA Downgrade or Financial Failure of Our Insurance Carriers May Have an Adverse Impact on our Financial Condition\nThe insurance carrier(s) we utilize have satisfactory financial ratings at the time the policies are placed and made effective based on various insurance carrier rating agencies commonly used in the insurance industry. However, these financial ratings may not remain satisfactory or constant throughout the policy period. There is a risk these financial ratings may be downgraded throughout the policy period or the insurance carrier(s) may experience a financial failure. A downgrade or financial failure of our insurance carrier(s) may result in their inability to pay current and future claims. This inability to pay claims may have an adverse impact on our financial condition. In addition, a downgrade or a financial failure of our insurance carrier(s) may cause our insurance renewal or replacement policy costs to increase.\nWe May Not Receive Some of the Proceeds from the Sale of Our Ownership Interests in Barclays Center and the Nets\nOn January 29, 2016, we completed the sale of Barclays Center and the Nets to Onexim Sports and Entertainment Holdings USA, Inc. (\u201cOnexim\u201d). Proceeds from the sale were in a combination of cash and notes receivable. The sales price for our equity interest in Barclays Center was $162,600,000 generating net cash proceeds of $60,924,000 and a note receivable of $92,600,000 (the \u201cArena Note\u201d). The sales price for our equity interest in the Nets was $125,100,000 payable entirely in the form of a note receivable (the \u201cNets Note\u201d). There is no guarantee that Onexim will be able to repay us the full amount of the Arena Note and/or the Nets Note when they become due and payable. If Onexim defaults on the Arena Note and/or the Nets Note, we may not be able to recover any of the amounts owed to us under such note(s), which would require us to write-off some or all of the Arena Note and/or the Nets Note and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe May Be Adversely Impacted by Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. In some instances, federal, state and local laws require abatement or removal of specific hazardous materials such as asbestos-containing materials or lead-based paint, in the event of demolition, renovations, remodeling, damage or decay. Laws and regulations also impose specific worker protection and notification requirements and govern emissions of and exposure to hazardous or toxic substances, such as asbestos fibers in the air. We incur costs to comply with such laws and regulations, but we may not have been or may not be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations.\nUnder certain environmental laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at that property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Certain contamination is difficult to remediate fully and can lead to more costly design specifications, such as a requirement to install vapor barrier systems, or a limitation on the use of the property and could preclude development of a site. The presence of hazardous substances on a property could also result in personal injury, claims against us by private parties or contributions made by us to other parties to pay claims. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes may also be liable for the costs of the investigation, removal and remediation of those wastes at the disposal or treatment facility, regardless of whether that facility is owned or operated by that person.\nWe have invested, and will continue to invest in, properties that have been used for or are near properties that have had industrial purposes in the past. As a result, our properties are or may become contaminated with hazardous or toxic substances. We will incur costs to investigate and possibly to remediate those conditions and some contamination may remain in or under the properties even after such remediation. While we investigate these sites and work with all relevant governmental authorities to meet their standards given our intended use of the property, there may be new information identified in the future indicating there are additional unaddressed environmental impacts. In addition, there could be technical developments that will require new or different remedies to be undertaken in the future, and the regulatory standards imposed by governmental authorities could change in the future.\nAs a result of the above, the value of our properties could decrease, our income from developed properties could decrease, our projects could be delayed, we could become obligated to third parties pursuant to indemnification agreements or guarantees, our expense to remediate or maintain our properties could increase, and our ability to successfully sell, rent or finance our properties could be adversely affected by environmental matters in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operation. We may incur losses related to environmental matters, including losses that may materially exceed any available insurance.\nOur Directors and Executive Officers May Have Interests in Competing Properties, and We Do Not Have Non-Compete Agreements with Certain of Our Directors and Executive Officers\nUnder our current policy, no director or executive officer, including any member of the Ratner, Miller and Shafran families, is allowed to invest in a competing real estate opportunity without first obtaining the approval of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We do not have non-compete agreements with any director or executive officer, other than Ronald Ratner, Bruce Ratner, David LaRue and Robert O\u2019Brien. Upon leaving Forest City, any other director, officer or employee could compete with us. Notwithstanding our policy, we permit our principal stockholders who are officers and employees to develop, expand, operate or sell, independent of our business, certain commercial, industrial and residential properties they owned prior to the implementation of our policy. As a result of their ownership of these properties, a conflict of interest may arise between them and Forest City, which may not be resolved in our favor. The conflict may involve the development or expansion of properties that may compete with our properties and the solicitation of tenants to lease these properties.\nOur Success Depends on Recruiting and Retaining Key Personnel With Extensive Experience Dealing With the Commercial Real Estate Industry, and The Loss of These Key Personnel Could Threaten Our Ability to Operate Our Business Successfully\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of our senior management team. Each member of our senior management team has extensive experience in the commercial real estate industry based on their time managing our predecessor, Forest City Enterprises, Inc., and other companies devoted to real estate investment, management and development. Each member of our senior management team has developed key relationships through past business dealings with numerous members of the commercial real estate community, including current and prospective tenants, lenders, investors, industry groups, real estate brokers, developers and managers. If we lost key members of the senior management team, our relationships with these groups could suffer.\nWe are Subject to Recapture Risks Associated with Sale of Tax Credits\nAs part of our financing strategy, we have financed several real estate projects through limited partnerships with investment partners. The investment partner, typically a large, sophisticated institution or corporate investor, invests cash in exchange for a limited partnership interest and special allocations of expenses and the majority of tax losses and credits associated with the project. These partnerships typically require us to indemnify, on an after-tax or \u201cgrossed up\u201d basis, the investment partner against the failure to receive or the loss of allocated tax credits and tax losses.\nIf all necessary requirements for qualification for such tax credits are not met, our investment partners may not be able to receive expense allocations associated with these properties and we may be required to indemnify our investment partners on an after-tax basis for these amounts. Indemnification payments (if required) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nA Downturn in the Housing Market May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nAt Stapleton, our remaining active land project, we depend on homebuilders and buyers to continue buying our land inventory. Our residential land sales at Stapleton have remained steady and historically have not been as negatively impacted by past recessions as other residential land projects throughout the United States. However, if the national housing market experiences a downturn, it may eventually have a more pronounced negative impact on Stapleton. Our ability to sustain our historical level of land sales at Stapleton depends in part on the continued strength of the local housing market. Our failure to successfully sell our land inventory on favorable terms, or at all, would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows and could result in a write-down in the value of our land due to impairment.\nIn addition, we have made certain interest-bearing advances to the Park Creek Metropolitan District (the \u201cDistrict\u201d) for in-tract infrastructure at Stapleton. The District is obligated to repay the advances pursuant to various Reimbursement Agreements. The District intends to repay the advances from the future issuances of bonds, supported by the real estate tax base at Stapleton. If the future real estate tax base at Stapleton is not adequate to support the projected amount of future issuances of bonds to repay the advances, we may have to write-off some or all of the advances, which could be significant.\nFailure to Continue to Maintain Effective Internal Controls in Accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Ability to Ensure Timely and Reliable Financial Reporting\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires our management to evaluate the effectiveness of, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal control over financial reporting. The process of documenting, testing and evaluating our internal control over financial reporting is complex and time consuming. Due to this complexity and the time-consuming nature of the process, and because currently unforeseen events or circumstances beyond our control could arise, we may not be able to continue to comply fully in subsequent fiscal periods with Section 404 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404, which could adversely affect public confidence in our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data to ensure timely and reliable external financial reporting.\nCompliance or Failure to Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Other Similar Laws Could Result in Substantial Costs\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including office buildings, be made accessible to disabled persons. In the event that we are not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the federal government could fine us or private parties could be awarded damages against us. If we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may also incur significant costs complying with other regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. In addition, existing requirements may change and compliance with future requirements may require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nLegislative and Regulatory Actions Taken Now or in the Future Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nThe 2007-2009 recession resulted in governmental regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. This increased scrutiny resulted in unprecedented programs and actions targeted at restoring stability in the financial markets and in creating a stronger regulatory framework to reduce the risk and severity of future crises.\nIn July 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related requirements that have been, and will in the future be, imposed on publicly-traded companies under the Dodd-Frank Act. Several of these provisions require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly-traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments, heightens certain independence standards for compensation advisers and authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates for board seats using a registrant\u2019s proxy materials. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities. In addition, if stockholders do not vote to approve our executive compensation practices and/or new equity plans or amendments to our current equity plans, these actions may interfere with our ability to attract and retain key personnel who are essential to our future success. Given the uncertainty associated with both the results of the existing Dodd-Frank Act requirements and the manner in which additional provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact of such requirements on our operations is unclear. Accordingly, the changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of business activities, require changes to certain business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the quoted trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our stockholders.\nIn addition, U.S. Government, Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies may take other actions to address the current economy. Additionally, the new U.S. presidential administration and Congress may take actions, whether through legislation, regulation, or administrative action, that would amend or repeal some or all of Dodd-Frank and/or other financial services legislation enacted in response to the financial crisis. While we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, such actions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in Federal, State or Local Tax Laws and International Trade Agreements Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nFrom time to time, changes in federal, state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted. These changes could impact the rates paid for items such as income, real estate, sales or other taxes. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and amounts of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets, equity or income. Such changes could also impact our tenants as well as individual customers of those tenants, which could impact our ability to lease space in our properties. This in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the new U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. It remains unclear what the new U.S. presidential administration will do, if anything, with respect to existing laws, regulations, or trade agreements. If the new U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be affected.\nChanges in Market Conditions Could Negatively Impact the Market Price of Our Publicly Traded Securities\nAt times, the stock market can experience volatile conditions resulting in substantial price and volume fluctuations often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. A decline in the price of our common stock could have an adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to generate capital through sales of our common stock, subjecting us to further credit rating downgrades and, in the case of a substantial decline, increasing the risk of not satisfying the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards.\nInflation May Adversely Affect our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncreases in inflation at a rate higher than increases in rental income could have a negative impact on our operating margins and cash flows. In some circumstances, increases in operating expenses for commercial properties can be passed on to our tenants. However, some of our commercial leases contain clauses that may prevent us from easily passing on increases of operating expenses to the respective tenants.\nCybersecurity Risks and Cyber Incidents Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Disrupt Operations\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. We face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nWhile we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems, we also depend on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. Although we along with such third parties employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, including password protection, firewalls, backup servers, threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a data breach. Furthermore, the security measures employed by third-party service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems.\nOur three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and private data exposure. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or resulting negative media attention.\nA cyber incident could:\n\u2022\nDisrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;\n\u2022\nResult in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines;\n\u2022\nResult in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;\n\u2022\nResult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nResult in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;\n\u2022\nRequire significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;\n\u2022\nSubject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or\n\u2022\nDamage our reputation among our tenants, investors and associates.\nMoreover, cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants, including unauthorized access to customers\u2019 credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business.\nWe Operate Through an Operating Partnership and, as Such, Rely on Funds Received From Our Operating Partnership to Pay Liabilities, and the Interests of Our Stockholders are Structurally Subordinated to All Liabilities and Obligations of Our Operating Partnership and Its Subsidiaries\nWe hold substantially all of our assets, and conduct substantially all of our business, through Forest City Enterprises, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d). Consequently, our ability to service our debt obligations and ability to pay dividends on shares of our common stock is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Operating Partnership, the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors and the ability of the Operating Partnership to make intercompany distributions to us. Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the Operating Partnership will be prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, the total liabilities of the Operating Partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and certain liabilities to the partners in the Operating Partnership) would exceed the fair value of the Operating Partnership\u2019s assets.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company, the equity interests of our stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, claims of our stockholders will be satisfied only after all of our and the Operating Partnership\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nIf the Operating Partnership Fails to Qualify As a Partnership For Federal Income Tax Purposes, We Would Not Qualify As a REIT and Would Suffer Other Adverse Consequences\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership will not be subject to entity-level federal income tax. Instead, each of its partners, including the Company, will be required to pay tax on its allocable share of the Operating Partnership\u2019s income. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of the Operating Partnership (or any other limited partnership subsidiary of the REIT) as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership (or any such other limited partnership subsidiary of the Company) as an entity taxable as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would be unable to satisfy the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests that must be met in order to qualify as a REIT and, accordingly, we would likely be prevented from so qualifying. Also, the failure of the Operating Partnership or any limited partnership subsidiary of the Company to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes could cause the partnership to become subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to the partners in such partnership, including the Company.\nOur UPREIT Structure Could Inhibit Us From Selling Properties or Retiring Debt That Would Otherwise Be in Our Best Interest\nTo ensure that the sellers of properties are able to contribute properties to the Operating Partnership on a tax-deferred basis, contributors of such properties may require us to agree to maintain a certain level of minimum debt at the Operating Partnership level and refrain from selling such properties for a period of time. Our UPREIT structure, therefore, could inhibit us from selling properties or retiring debt that would otherwise be in our best interest.\nOur Interest May be Diluted Upon the Issuance of Additional Units of the Operating Partnership\nUpon the issuance of partnership units in the Operating Partnership to partners other than the Company and FCILP, LLC, a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of the state of Delaware (\u201cFCILP\u201d), the percentage interest of the Company and FCILP (and therefore, the indirect interest of our stockholders) in assets of the Operating Partnership would be reduced. This reduction in the indirect interest of initial stockholders would remain if partnership units were redeemed for cash (provided such cash represented the proceeds of a new issuance of shares of our common stock) or for shares of our Class A common stock, even though our interest in the Operating Partnership would increase.\nConflicts of Interest May Arise Between the Interests of Our Stockholders and the Interests of Holders of Partnership Units\nAs the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to the limited partners in the Operating Partnership. In most cases, we expect that the interests of such limited partners will coincide with the interests of us and our stockholders because (a) we own a substantial amount of the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and (b) the limited partners generally receive shares of our Class A common stock or cash proceeds tied to the share price of our Class A common stock upon redemption of their partnership units. Under certain circumstances, however, the rights and interests of the limited partners might conflict with those of our stockholders. The agreement of limited partnership of the Operating Partnership provides that in the event we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that any such conflict cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the Operating Partnership\u2019s limited partners, such conflict will be resolved in favor of our stockholders.\nOur UPREIT Structure May Increase the Costs of Managing the Company and the Operational Complexity and Risk of Our Corporate Structure\nThe conversion of our predecessor, Forest City Enterprises, Inc., to the Operating Partnership may result in us incurring more costs than Forest City Enterprises, Inc. historically incurred, including professional expenses related to general and administrative, accounting, tax, consulting, audit and legal costs. There can be no assurance that our business plan and future expected growth will make up for any increase in general and administrative expenses. Further, we are structured as an UPREIT and as such, our operations are more complex than those of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. prior to the REIT conversion. This complexity may introduce other operational risks that previously did not exist and cannot reasonably be anticipated, and such risks may have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and/or financial condition.\nIssuance of Securities by Us With Claims That Are Senior to Those of Holders of Shares of Our Common Stock May Limit or Prevent Us From Paying Dividends on Our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock are equity interests. As such, shares of our common stock will rank junior to any indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us. We may issue senior securities, which may expose us to risks associated with leverage, including increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred securities, which will rank senior to shares of our common stock in our capital structure, the holders of such preferred securities may have separate voting rights and other rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than the rights, preferences and privileges incident to holding shares of our common stock, and the issuance of such preferred securities could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in our best interest.\nIn addition, partnership interests or other securities issued by the Operating Partnership may have a senior priority on cash flow or liquidation proceeds generated by the Operating Partnership.\nUnlike indebtedness, for which principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of shares of our common stock, dividends are payable only when, as and if authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, debt service requirements, distributions to be received from the Operating Partnership, other cash needs and any other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant or as required by applicable law. We may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and other obligations that will rank senior to shares of our common stock.\nCertain Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws and Maryland Law May Inhibit a Change in Control That Stockholders Consider Favorable and Could Also Limit the Market Price of Our Common Stock\nCertain provisions in our charter and bylaws and Maryland law may impede, or prevent, a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock (such provisions being intended to, among other purposes, facilitate our compliance with certain Code requirements relating to ownership of our stock);\n\u2022\nprevent our stockholders from amending our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice and informational requirements and time limitations on any director nomination or proposal that a stockholder wishes to make at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of our Board of Directors, which would otherwise permit less than a majority of stockholders to elect one or more directors; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to, without stockholder approval, amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares.\nCertain Provisions of Maryland Law Could Impede Changes in Control\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\u201cMGCL\u201d) may impede a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or inhibit a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interest of holders of shares of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\n\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations;\n\u2022\n\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that, subject to certain exceptions, holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of the Company (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the holder to exercise voting power in the election of directors within one of three increasing ranges) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares,\u201d subject to certain exceptions) have no voting rights with respect to the control shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares; and\n\u2022\nadditionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter and bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions.\nAs permitted by the MGCL, our Board of Directors has by resolution exempted from the Maryland Business Combination Act all business combinations between us and any other person, provided that each such business combination is first approved by our Board of Directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person). Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that these exemptions or resolutions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\nTax Protection Agreements Could Limit Our Ability to Sell or Otherwise Dispose of Certain Properties and May Require the Operating Partnership to Maintain Certain Debt Levels That Otherwise Would Not Be Required to Operate Our Business\nWe may from time to time enter into tax protection agreements with certain third parties, including joint venture partners (a \u201cTax Protected Party\u201d). These tax protection agreements may provide generally that prior to a specified date (the \u201cTax Protected Period\u201d), if we (1) sell, exchange, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of the protected property (the \u201cTax Protected Property\u201d) in a taxable transaction, (2) cause or permit any transaction that results in the disposition by the Tax Protected Party of all or any portion of his/her interest in the Operating Partnership in a taxable transaction, or (3) fail to maintain indebtedness that would be allocable to the Tax Protected Parties for tax purposes or, alternatively, fail to offer the Tax Protected Parties who own units in the Operating Partnership the opportunity to guarantee specific types of the Operating Partnership\u2019s indebtedness in order to enable them to continue to defer certain tax liabilities, then we will indemnify the Tax Protected Parties who own units in the Operating Partnership against certain resulting tax liabilities. Our indemnification obligations may generally decline ratably over the Tax Protected Period. Therefore, it may be economically prohibitive for us to sell, exchange, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of one or more of the Tax Protected Properties during the Tax Protected Period because of these indemnity obligations. Moreover, these obligations may require us to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business. As a result, these tax protection agreements may, during their respective terms, restrict our ability to take actions or make decisions that otherwise would be in our best interest.", "PERMNO": 65584, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "FCE.A"}
