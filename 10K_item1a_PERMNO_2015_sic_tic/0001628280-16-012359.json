RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to all other information provided to you in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Brookfield\u2019s Proposed Acquisition of our Company\nThere are risks and uncertainties as a result of Brookfield\u2019s proposed acquisition of us.\nAs described above, on February 25, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management for $18.25 per share in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Brookfield will acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock, other than those shares currently held by Brookfield Property Partners L.P. and its affiliates, in a transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion, including our indebtedness. The merger agreement prohibits the payment of any further dividends by us, other than as necessary to maintain our REIT status and a closing dividend as part of the $18.25 per share consideration payable in the transaction. The Special Committee of our Board of Directors unanimously approved the merger agreement. Completion of the transaction is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2016, and is contingent upon customary closing conditions, including the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock not currently held by Brookfield Property Partners L.P. and its affiliates.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to Brookfield\u2019s proposed acquisition of us. For example, the proposed acquisition may not be consummated in the timeframe or manner currently anticipated or may not be consummated at all, as a result of several factors, including, among other things, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, including a termination under circumstances that would require us to pay a termination fee, as described below. In addition, there can be no assurance that the approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock or a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock not currently held by Brookfield Property Partners L.P. and its affiliates will be obtained, that the other conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the termination of the proposed acquisition. Further, Brookfield could default on its obligations under the merger agreement. Any delay in closing or a failure to close could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price as well as our relationships with our tenants, lenders, vendors, suppliers and employees.\nPending the closing of the proposed acquisition, the merger agreement restricts us from engaging in certain specified actions without Brookfield\u2019s consent, and contains a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision in which we may not solicit any transaction that would result in the acquisition of more than 20% of us or our assets. (However, prior to receipt of the required stockholder approvals, we may consider any unsolicited, bona fide proposal that is or is reasonably likely to lead to a \u201cSuperior Proposal\u201d, which is generally limited to those proposals for an acquisition of a majority of us or our assets that the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is more favorable from a financial point of view to our stockholders than the Brookfield acquisition.) These provisions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities or more favorable alternative strategic transactions that may arise prior to the closing of the proposed acquisition.\nIn addition, pending the closing, the proposed acquisition could also cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFor example:\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may be directed to transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees (notwithstanding our establishment in January 2016 of a Retention Plan for our named executive officers and certain other senior executives; see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding our Retention Plan); and\n\u2022\ntenants, lenders, suppliers, vendors and other parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about our future and seek retail space elsewhere (in the case of tenants and prospect tenants;) or alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their business relationships with us.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $40 million (net of any transaction expenses of Brookfield reimbursed by us, as described below). Specifically, we will be required to pay the termination fee if (i) we terminate the merger agreement and, substantially concurrently therewith, enter into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal, (ii) a \u201cTriggering Event\u201d occurs, which generally means that our Board of Directors or the Special Committee changes, withholds or fails to publicly affirm its recommendation that stockholders approve the Brookfield transactions, or we materially breach our \u201cno-shop\u201d obligations or obligations with respect to holding the stockholders meeting or (iii) (A) the merger agreement is terminated because the closing does not occur by October 31, 2016, the required stockholder approvals are not received or we materially breach the merger agreement, (B) following the date of the merger agreement, a competing acquisition proposal is publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn and (C) within 12 months following such termination of the merger agreement, a competing acquisition proposal is consummated or we enter into a definitive agreement for a competing acquisition proposal during such 12-month period, which is thereafter consummated. We and Brookfield will also be required to reimburse the other party\u2019s transaction expenses if we or Brookfield, as applicable, materially breaches the merger agreement.\nMoreover, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed acquisition, and most of these fees and costs may be payable by us even if the proposed acquisition is not consummated.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history as an independent company upon which you can evaluate our performance, and accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any recently independent company encounters.\nWe are a Delaware corporation that was created to hold certain assets and liabilities of GGP. Prior to January 12, 2012, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of GGP Limited Partnership (\"GGPLP\"). GGP distributed the assets and liabilities of 30 of its wholly-owned properties to us on January 12, 2012 (\"Spin-Off Date\"). We completed our spin-off from GGP on January 12, 2012, and have limited experience operating as an independent company and performing various corporate functions, including human resources, tax administration, legal (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") and with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act), treasury administration, investor relations, internal audit, insurance, information technology and telecommunications services, and accounting functions.\nOur business is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the early stages of a business enterprise in an intensely competitive industry. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of independent business operations, particularly companies that are heavily affected by economic conditions and operate in highly competitive environments.\nWe may be unable to reposition or redevelop some of our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business strategy is focused on repositioning and redeveloping our properties. In connection with these repositioning and redevelopment projects, we are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient capital to proceed with planned repositioning or redevelopment activities;\n\u2022\nredevelopment costs of a project may exceed original estimates or available financing, possibly making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain zoning or other required governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022\noccupancy rates and rents at a completed project may not meet projections and, therefore, the project may not be profitable; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain anchor store and mortgage lender approvals, if applicable, for repositioning or redevelopment activities.\nThere can be no assurance that our repositioning and redevelopment projects will have the desired results of attracting and retaining desirable tenants and increasing customer traffic. If repositioning or redevelopment projects are unsuccessful, our investments in those projects may not be fully recoverable from future operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEconomic and market conditions, especially in the retail sector, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe retail sector is affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but could decrease the income generated by our properties. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in national, regional and local economic climates, which may be negatively impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, increased unemployment, lack of availability of consumer credit, increased levels of consumer debt, poor housing market conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors;\n\u2022\nlocal real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the supply and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants;\n\u2022\nlevels of consumer spending, consumer confidence and seasonal spending;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in governmental regulations, such as local zoning and land use laws, environmental regulations or local tax structures;\n\u2022\nperceptions by retailers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and quality of competing retail properties and other retailing options, such as the Internet; and\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs, such as increases in repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes, utility rates and insurance premiums.\nSales at stores operating in our malls could be adversely affected as the result of one or more of these factors. Since we derive substantially all of our income from our retail tenants, a considerable decline in our tenants\u2019 operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to lease or re-lease space in our properties on favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur results of operations depend on our ability to strategically lease space in our properties, including re-leasing space in properties where leases are expiring, optimizing our tenant mix and leasing properties on more economically favorable terms. We are continually focused on our ability to lease properties and collect rents from tenants. If we are unable to lease or re-lease space in our properties to an appropriate mix of tenants at attractive rates or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur tenants may be unable to pay minimum rents and expense recovery charges, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf the sales at stores operating in our malls decline, tenants might be unable to pay their existing minimum rents or expense recovery charges, since these rents and charges would represent a higher percentage of their sales. If our tenants' sales decline, new tenants\nwould be less likely to be willing to pay minimum rents as high as they would otherwise pay. We may not be able to collect rents sufficient to meet our costs. Because substantially all of our income is derived from rentals of real property, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of tenants are unable to meet their obligations.\nCertain co-tenancy provisions in our lease agreements may result in reduced rent payments, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSome of our lease agreements include a co-tenancy provision which allows the mall tenant to pay a reduced rent amount and, in certain instances, terminate the lease, if we fail to maintain a certain number of anchor tenants or a certain occupancy level at the mall. In addition, certain of our tenants have the ability to terminate their leases with us prior to the lease expiration date if their sales do not meet agreed upon thresholds. Therefore, if occupancy, tenancy or sales fall below certain thresholds, rents we are entitled to receive from our retail tenants could be reduced and our ability to attract new tenants may be limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe failure to fully recover cost reimbursements for common area maintenance, taxes and insurance from tenants could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe computation of cost reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance (\"CAM\"), insurance and real estate taxes is complex and involves numerous judgments, including interpretation of lease terms and other tenant lease provisions. Most tenants make monthly fixed payments of CAM, real estate taxes and other cost reimbursement items. After the end of the calendar year, we compute each tenant's final cost reimbursements and issue a bill or credit for the full amount, after considering amounts paid by the tenant during the year. The billed amounts could be disputed by the tenant or become the subject of a tenant audit or even litigation. There can be no assurance that we will collect all or substantially all of this entire amount.\nOur properties are also subject to the risk of increases in CAM and other operating expenses, which typically include real estate taxes, energy and other utility costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas, security, housekeeping, property and liability insurance and administrative costs. For example, municipalities might seek to raise real estate taxes paid by our property in their jurisdiction because of their strained budgets or for other reasons. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable retail space in our specific geographic markets might limit our ability to pass these increases through to tenants, or, if we do pass all or a part of these increases on, might lead tenants to seek retail space elsewhere, which, in either case, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on major tenants, making us vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of such tenants.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our tenants that generate revenues equal to or exceeding 1.5% of our aggregate revenues are as follows:\nThe retail shopping sector is affected by economic conditions as well as the competitive nature of the retail business and the competition for market share where stronger retailers have out-positioned some of the weaker retailers. These shifts have forced some market share away from weaker retailers and required them, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and/or close stores.\nIn the event of deterioration in the financial condition of our major tenants, we may be required to write-off and/or accelerate depreciation and amortization expense associated with a significant portion of the tenant-related deferred charges in future periods. Our income and ability to meet financial obligations could also be materially and adversely affected in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency or significant downturn in the business of one of these tenants. In addition, our results could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of these tenants do not renew their leases as they expire.\nThe bankruptcy or store closures of anchor stores or national tenants may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe income we generate depends in part on the ability of our anchor stores and national tenants to attract customers to our properties and generate traffic, which affects the property's ability to attract in-line tenants, and thus the revenue generated by the property. We also derive significant revenues from these tenants. In recent years, in connection with economic conditions and other changes in the retail industry, some anchor stores and national tenants have experienced decreases in operating performance. As a result, a number of retailers, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, voluntarily closed their stores or sought lease modifications to reduce their rents or expense recovery charges. Certain anchor stores or national tenants have engaged in restructuring transactions, including mergers, consolidations and dispositions. Any such restructuring transaction could involve withdrawal from certain geographic areas, such as secondary or tertiary trade areas where many of our properties are located, and closures or sales of stores operated by them. If an anchor store or national tenant were to close its stores at our properties, we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant, as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant space, at attractive rates, or at all. Additionally, anchor store or national tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at the property. Moreover, store closures by an anchor store and/or a national tenant may allow other tenants to terminate, or modify the economic terms of, their leases at the property pursuant to co-tenancy provisions described above. As a result, the bankruptcy, insolvency, closure or general downturn in the business of an anchor store or national tenant, as well as requests from such tenants for significant rent relief or other lease concessions, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to change our portfolio is limited because real estate investments are relatively illiquid.\nEquity real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which may limit our ability to strategically change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control. Moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to REITs that limit our ability to sell assets. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or at all, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. The number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing malls is limited. We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. In addition, economic and capital market conditions might make it more difficult for us to sell properties or might adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers might experience increased costs of debt financing or other difficulties in obtaining debt financing.\nIn addition, significant expenditures associated with each equity investment, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. If income from a property declines while the related expenses do not decline, our income and cash available to us would be adversely affected. If it becomes necessary or desirable for us to dispose of one or more of our mortgaged properties, we might not be able to obtain a release of the lien on the mortgaged property without payment of the associated debt. The foreclosure of a mortgage on a property or inability to sell a property could adversely affect the level of cash available to us. These factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe operate in a competitive business.\nThere are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space and many of our competitors operate on a much larger scale than we do. Our properties are generally regional malls in protected markets or submarkets and our ability to compete for certain tenants may be limited as a result. In addition, retailers at our properties face continued competition from retailers at other regional malls, outlet malls and other discount shopping malls, discount shopping clubs, full-line large format value retailers, catalog companies, and through Internet sales and telemarketing. Competition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn particular, the increase in both the availability and popularity of online shopping has created a growing source of competitive pressure on the retailers at our properties. In certain categories, such as books, music and electronics, online retailing has become\na significant proportion of total sales and has affected retailers in those categories significantly. The ability of online retailers to offer a wide range of products for sale, often with substantial price and tax savings, and free or discounted shipping, allows these online retailers to compete with the retailers at our properties by offering added convenience and cost-saving incentives to consumers in both high density major metropolitan markets and rural areas. Additionally, small businesses and specialty retailers, who have previously been limited to marketing and selling their products within their immediate geographical area, are now able to reach a broader group of consumers and compete with the retailers at our properties.\nWe also compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities. These competitors include REITs, investment banking firms and private institutional investors. Competition for investment opportunities may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investments on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur ability to realize our strategies and capitalize on our competitive strengths are dependent on our ability to effectively operate a large portfolio of malls, maintain good relationships with our tenants and consumers, and remain well-capitalized, and our failure to do any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated contractual debt, excluding non-cash debt market rate adjustments, was $1.71 billion, all of which was secured by our properties. As a result of our substantial debt, we are required to use a significant portion of our cash flows for our debt service requirements, which limits our ability to use those cash flows for our operations or other purposes, including to pay dividends. Additionally, any substantial decrease in our cash flows or increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or force us to modify our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, our level of indebtedness could have other adverse consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, market and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given that certain of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities, access equity, reinvest in and develop our properties, and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into marketing and hedging transactions by reducing the number of potential counterparties with whom we could enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions; and\n\u2022\ngiving secured lenders the ability to foreclose on our assets.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturities of mortgages, notes, and loans payable as of December 31, 2015 and for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):\nA deterioration of the capital and credit markets could materially and adversely affect our ability to access funds and the capital needed to refinance debt or obtain new debt.\nWe are significantly dependent upon external financing to fund the growth of our business and ensure that we meet our debt servicing requirements. Our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institutions to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. An economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets. When markets are volatile, access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and many financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments. The failure of one or more significant participants to our 2013 Senior Facility to meet their funding commitments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. This may make it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and/or to meet our debt service requirements as they mature. There can be no assurance as to whether we will be able to obtain debt in the future, or that the financing options available to us will be on favorable or acceptable terms.\nIf we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indebtedness, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe 2013 Senior Facility contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and default and cross-default provisions that are customary for such a real estate loan. In addition, the 2013 Senior Facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including borrowing base loan to value and debt yield, corporate maximum leverage ratio, minimum ratio of adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to fixed charges, minimum tangible net worth, minimum mortgaged property requirement, maximum unhedged variable rate debt and maximum recourse indebtedness. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us. In addition, our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with the covenants in the 2013 Senior Facility would result in a default thereunder and, absent a waiver or an amendment from our lenders, cause the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings under the 2013 Senior Facility and could result in the acceleration of other of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we have property level debt on two of our properties, which guarantor (Rouse Properties, L.P.), that contain minimum tangible net worth covenant calculations which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a history of prior net losses and may not be profitable in the future.\nOur historical consolidated financial data shows that we have a history of prior net losses, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve sustained profitability going forward. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had GAAP net income of $40.7 million and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred GAAP net losses of $(51.7) million, and $(54.7) million, respectively. See \"Selected Financial Data.\" If we do not improve our profitability or if we generate negative cash flow from operating activities, the trading value of our common stock may decline.\nOur real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges.\nOn a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. A property's value is impaired only if the estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property. In our estimate of cash flows, we\nconsider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment charge is equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value. Such a determination would have a direct impact on our earnings because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to earnings. There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we took an impairment charge of $2.9 million on Collin Creek Mall as the aggregate carrying value was higher than the fair value of the asset. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. We may be required to take additional impairment charges on our assets, including those we designate as \"special consideration assets\", in the future. A property is designated as a special consideration asset when it has a heightened probability of being conveyed to its lender absent substantive renegotiation.\nSome of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.\nA number of our properties are located in areas which are subject to natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and oil spills. For example, certain of our properties are located in California or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes. Furthermore, some of our properties are located in coastal regions, and would therefore be affected by any future rises in sea levels. The occurrence of natural or other disasters could delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nPossible terrorist activity or other acts of violence could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFuture terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates. Terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or insurance generally, might be lower or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that our tenants are affected by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be materially and adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. These acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies.\nAny one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital.\nWe could incur significant costs related to government regulation and litigation over environmental matters and various other federal, state and local regulatory requirements.\nUnder various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property and may be held liable to third parties for bodily injury or property damage (investigation and/or clean-up costs) incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or otherwise caused the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination discovered at our properties could adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or borrow with respect to the real estate. The operations of current and former tenants at our properties have involved, or may have involved, the use of hazardous materials or generated hazardous wastes. The release of such hazardous materials and wastes could result in our incurring liabilities to remediate any resulting contamination if the responsible party is unable or unwilling to do so. In addition, our properties may be exposed to the risk of contamination originating from other sources. While a property owner generally is not responsible for remediating contamination that has migrated on-site from an off-site source, the contaminant's presence can have adverse effects on the operation or redevelopment of our properties. Environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for\ndamages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property may be used or how businesses may be operated on that property.\nOur properties have been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times; however, the identification of new areas of contamination, a change in the extent or known scope of contamination or changes in cleanup requirements could result in significant costs to us.\nOur properties are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety regulatory requirements that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, storm water and wastewater discharges, potable wells, lead-based paint and waste management. We could incur substantial costs to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and could be subject to significant fines and penalties for non-compliance with applicable laws. For example, certain federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments. These regulations also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air, which may necessitate implementation of site specific maintenance practices. Certain laws also impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with asbestos-containing materials. Asbestos-containing building materials are present at some of our properties and may be present at others. To minimize the risk of onsite asbestos being improperly disturbed, we have developed and implemented asbestos operations and maintenance programs to manage asbestos-containing materials and suspected asbestos-containing materials in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have recorded a liability in our financial statements of $6.1 million related to potential environmental remediation at our properties which are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of our properties. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments available to us do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities. It is also possible that subsequent investigations will identify material contamination, that adverse environmental conditions have arisen subsequent to the performance of the environmental assessments, or that there are material environmental liabilities of which management is unaware. Moreover, no assurances can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or (ii) the current environmental condition of our properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties, by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties unrelated to us.\nWe also may incur costs to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar laws, which require that all public accommodations meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSome potential losses are not insured, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate in light of the size and scope of our portfolio and business operations. There are, however, some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.\nInflation could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following:\n\u2022\nDifficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents;\n\u2022\nDecreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations; and\n\u2022\nAn inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including CAM, real estate taxes and insurance.\nInflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. A rise in interest rates could have an immediate adverse effect on us due to our outstanding variable-rate debt. This risk can be managed or mitigated by utilizing interest rate protection products that generally allow us to replace variable-rate debt with fixed-rate debt. However, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such interest rate protection products will also continue to increase. In addition, in the event of a rise in interest rates, we may be unable to replace maturing debt with new debt at equal or better interest rates or at all.\nSecurity breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology networks and related systems.\nRisks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, or other methods, against persons inside our organization, persons with access to systems inside our organization, the U.S. government, financial markets or institutions, or major businesses, including tenants, could disrupt or disable networks and related systems, other critical infrastructures, and the normal operation of business. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Even though we may not be specifically targeted, cyber-attacks on the U.S. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other major businesses, including tenants, could disrupt our normal business operations and networks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInformation technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations, including managing our building systems. They also may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants and our service providers. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected. While to date we have not experienced a cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventive measures. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and related systems (including those caused by energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunications failures) could:\n\u2022\ndisrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;\n\u2022\nresult in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, and/or missed permitting deadlines;\n\u2022\nresult in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;\n\u2022\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nresult in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;\n\u2022\nrequire significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;\n\u2022\nsubject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties, or termination of leases or other agreements; or\n\u2022\ndamage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally.\nWe may also incur additional significant costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAn ownership limit, certain anti-takeover defenses and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (our \"charter\"), and our amended and restated bylaws (our \"bylaws\") contain the following limitations:\nThe ownership limit. Generally, for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code for a taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer \"individuals\" at any time during the last half of such taxable year. Our charter provides that no person may own more than 9.9% of the number or value, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of capital stock unless our Board of Directors provides a waiver from the ownership restrictions. The Code defines \"individuals\" for purposes of the requirement described above to include some types of entities. However, our charter also permits us to exempt a person from the ownership limit upon the satisfaction of certain conditions described therein. We have exempted Brookfield and certain others from the ownership limit, subject to certain conditions.\nSelected provisions of our charter. Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors:\n\u2022\nto cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nto classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and\n\u2022\nto set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that we issue.\nOur charter also prohibits our stockholders from acting by written consent.\nSelected provisions of our bylaws. Our bylaws contain the following limitations:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting without 20% or more of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings.\nSelected provisions of Delaware law. We are a Delaware corporation, and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law applies to us. In general, Section 203 prevents an \"interested stockholder\" (as defined below) from engaging in a \"business combination\" (as defined in the statute) with us for three years following the date that person becomes an interested stockholder unless one or more of the following occurs:\n\u2022\nbefore that person became an interested stockholder, our Board of Directors approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder or approved the business combination;\n\u2022\nupon completion of the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) stock held by directors who are also officers of our company and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u2022\nfollowing the transaction in which that person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by our Board of Directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThe statute defines an \"interested stockholder\" as any person that is the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or is our affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination.\nIn accordance with Section 203, we approved the transactions in which Brookfield and certain of its controlled affiliates acquired shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, Brookfield has a significant ownership of our common stock. This ownership of our common stock may impede a change in control transaction. See \"-Risks Related to our Common Stock Generally-Our substantial stockholder may exert influence over us that may be adverse to our best interests and those of our other stockholders.\"\nEach item discussed above may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company, even if a proposed transaction is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock. Further, these provisions may apply in instances where some stockholders consider a transaction beneficial to them.\nWe are subject to various reporting and other requirements under federal securities laws which may cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we, among other things, establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Establishing and monitoring these controls could result in significant costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.\nCompliance with changing regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could harm our business prospects.\nOur historical combined financial information is not representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical combined financial information prior to our spin-off from GGP does not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a stand-alone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future.\nRisks Related to our Status as a REIT\nWe may not be able to maintain our status as a REIT, which would deny us certain favorable tax treatment.\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT beginning with the filing of our federal income tax return for 2011. Subject to our ability to meet the requirements of a REIT, we intend to maintain this status in future periods. We believe that, commencing with the 2011 taxable year, we were organized and have operated so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, once an entity is qualified as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\") generally requires that such entity pay tax on or distribute 100% of its capital gains and distribute at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income to stockholders. To avoid current entity level U.S. federal income taxes, we expect to distribute 100% of our capital gains and ordinary income to stockholders annually.\nIf, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we would not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and federal income tax. If any of our REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT, such failure could result in our loss of REIT status. If we lose our REIT status, corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, would apply to our taxable income at regular corporate rates. As a result, the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities that would otherwise receive dividends would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. In addition, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn order for us to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied, we generally must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders each year, so that federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a REIT, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal income tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code.\nFrom time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves, or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms (the receipt of which cannot be assured), sell assets at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, or make taxable distributions of our capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Further, amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.\nComplying with REIT requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive investment opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and \u201creal estate assets\u201d (as defined in the Code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of our investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable REIT subsidiary (a \u201cTRS\u201d)) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.\nAdditionally, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our shares. We might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments.\nNew partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe recently enacted Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships. Under the new rules (which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017), among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner\u2019s distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented, it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly. The new partnership tax audit rules will apply to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. The changes created by these\nnew rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLegislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs could have materially and adversely affect us.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, and by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the IRS and the Treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect us or our investors. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify to be taxed as a REIT and/or the federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock Generally\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock could be volatile and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), which is the exchange on which our common stock is listed, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Overall weakness in the economy and other factors have contributed to extreme volatility of the equity markets generally, including the market price of our common stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nour actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, or changes in business strategy or prospects;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived conflicts of interest with our directors, officers or other executives;\n\u2022\nequity issuances by us, or share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated accounting problems;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to the level of leverage we employ;\n\u2022\nadditions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings estimates or those of any securities analysts;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher dividend yield for our common stock and would result in increased interest expenses on our debt;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain our REIT qualification;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the stock market generally; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital markets.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture issuances of debt securities and equity securities may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue debt or additional equity securities or incur additional borrowings. Upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and shares of preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before common stockholders. If we incur additional debt in the future, our future interest costs could increase, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are not required to offer any additional equity securities to existing common stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional common stock issuances, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities, warrants or options, will dilute the holdings of our existing common stockholders and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of our common stock. Our shares of preferred stock, if issued, would likely have a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to pay dividends to common stockholders. Because our decision to issue debt or additional equity securities or incur additional borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. Thus, common stockholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of additional borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe number of shares of common stock available for future issuance or sale could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of February 26, 2016, approximately 57.9 million shares of our common stock were outstanding, and we have the authority to issue up to 500 million shares. Subject to applicable law, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of our common stock on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate. Additionally, the resale by existing holders of a substantial number of our outstanding shares of common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, Brookfield beneficially owned approximately 33.5% of our common stock (based on their publicly reported holdings). Any disposition by Brookfield, or any other substantial stockholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. The sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether directly by us or in the secondary market, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities.\nOur substantial stockholder may exert influence over us that may be adverse to our best interests and those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Brookfield beneficially owned approximately 33.5% of our common stock (based on their publicly reported holdings). The concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock held by our substantial stockholder may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Brookfield. The interests of Brookfield could conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders. For example, Brookfield\u2019s concentration of ownership could allow Brookfield to influence our policies and strategies and could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable to us and our other stockholders. Brookfield may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nBrookfield has agreed that it will not, in connection with a merger, combination, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other similar business combination transaction involving us, convert, sell, exchange, transfer or convey any shares of common stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by it on terms that are more favorable than those available to all other holders of common stock. This restriction does not, however, limit Brookfield\u2019s ability to sell its shares of common stock to a third party at a higher price in circumstances other than the foregoing transactions. See also \u201c-Risks Related to Brookfield\u2019s Proposed Acquisition of our Company-There are risks and uncertainties as a result of Brookfield\u2019s proposed acquisition of us.\u201d\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level and no assurance can be given that we will be able to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future at current levels or at all.\nWe are generally required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy through quarterly dividends of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in such year, subject to certain adjustments. We have not established a minimum dividend payment level, and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors contained in this Annual Report. Although we have paid, and anticipate continuing to pay, quarterly dividends to our stockholders, our Board of Directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any future dividends to our stockholders, and such\ndetermination will depend on our earnings, financial condition, debt covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future or that the level of any future dividends we do make to our stockholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, dividends that we pay to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, a portion of our dividends may be designated by us as long-term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gain income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder\u2019s investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 67708, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "RSE"}
