RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of those risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could suffer. The risks and uncertainties discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur operations, business, and financial condition have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly our travel business.\nThe spread and continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty while reducing economic activity. The pandemic has resulted in transformational change in business and consumer behavior, as well as the implementation by authorities and businesses around the world of numerous measures aimed at containing the virus, at various times, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, business shutdowns, vaccination requirements, and mask mandates, among others, while some markets have also implemented multi-step policies with the goal of resuming activities that are or have previously been restricted. The effects of the pandemic, along with the measures implemented to combat the pandemic, continue to change and evolve as the pandemic changes and evolves. The regions in which we operate are continuously in varying stages of dealing with, and suffering impacts from, the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain jurisdictions and industries have experienced recoveries from the various stages of the pandemic, only to then face a resurgence or increase in new COVID-19 cases. Vaccination requirements, childcare needs and other issues, have led to individuals exiting the workforce, either permanently or temporarily. New variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been discovered and people continue to fall ill to COVID-19. These events have not only impacted and disrupted, and may continue to impact and disrupt, business and consumer spending and other habits, they have also impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers and business partners.\nIn particular, we expect that we may continue to experience impacts on our business and results of operations due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022The effect of COVID-19 on worldwide economic and financial market conditions, including conditions in the regions in which we operate.\n\u2022The negative impact of COVID-19 on the demand for worldwide travel and the length of time it may take for the travel industry to rebound after the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided.\n\u2022Volatility in the demand for, and the price of, fuel, caused by declines in demand as a result of the impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022Losses arising from customer, partner and merchant failures, and credit settlement risks.\n\u2022Revenue impacts driven by employee shortages or lack of employee growth caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any persistent decrease or plateau in workforce participation, such as, among other things, the shortage of truck drivers, which in turn affects the amount of trucking services in both the U.S. and the U.K., or a reduction of, or limited growth in, the number of workers eligible to utilize the products offered by our U.S. Health business.\n\u2022Risk of a lower or uneven demand for trucking services due to global supply chain issues created or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The modification of our business practices (including restricting employee travel, social distancing and remote working plans for our employees, and the cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences).\nThese and other factors may remain prevalent for a significant and unknown period of time and may continue to materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the ultimate and total impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its direct and indirect effects, and therefore the ultimate effects are highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its continued severity, whether resultant changes in business and consumer behavior continue for extended periods of time or, indefinitely, the success of the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the\nemergence and effect of new virus variants, the return of people to the workforce, the speed with which supply chain issues are resolved and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nIn addition, increased volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the lasting effect of the pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact and its potential effect on the ways people and businesses conduct themselves, including the continued reduced demand for worldwide travel, permanent shifts in the workforce, the availability of credit, impacts on our liquidity, continued governmental restrictions, and continued volatility in fuel demand and prices.\nThe foregoing and other continued effects on our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness and could heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described herein.\nA significant portion of our revenues is related to the dollar amount of fuel purchased by or through our customers and from our fuel retailer partners, and, as a result, a reduction in the demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services and/or volatility in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition.\nOur Fleet Solutions segment is our largest segment and customers and fuel retailer partners in this segment primarily purchase or sell fuel. Accordingly, a significant part of our overall revenue is derived from fuel purchases, making our revenues in this segment subject to historically volatile fuel prices. A portion of our total revenues result from fees paid to us by fuel providers based on a negotiated percentage of the purchase price of fuel purchased by our customers. We estimate that during 2022, each one cent decline in average domestic fuel prices below average actual prices would result in a $1.5 million decline in 2022 revenue. We are currently exposed to the full impact of fuel price declines and our net income is exposed to fuel price volatility. Therefore, extended declines in the price of fuel, as well as declines in the amount of fuel purchased by our customers or sold by our fuel retailer partners would have a material adverse effect on our total revenues and therefore our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFuel prices are volatile and influenced by many factors, all of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022domestic and foreign supply and demand for oil and gas, and market expectations regarding such supply and demand;\n\u2022investor speculation in commodities;\n\u2022actions by major oil exporting nations, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the ability of the same to maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022level of domestic and foreign oil production;\n\u2022advances in oil production technologies;\n\u2022excess or overbuilt infrastructure;\n\u2022geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, environmental activism, terrorism, or war, such as, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022oil refinery capacity and utilization rates;\n\u2022weather, including climate change and natural disasters;\n\u2022the value of the U.S. dollar (or other relevant currencies) versus other major currencies;\n\u2022implementation of fuel efficiency standards and the adoption by fleet customers of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency or alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, ethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen, and natural gas;\n\u2022general local, regional, or worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022governmental regulations, taxes and tariffs.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The long-term effects of these and other factors on prices for fuel could be substantial. The recent Russian military invasion into Ukraine, and the resulting sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and certain other countries, could significantly affect worldwide fuel prices, the long-term effects of which we cannot predict.\nAnother component of our revenue stream comes from the late fees that our customers pay on past due balances. As a result, a decrease in the price of fuel may lead to a decline in the amount of late fees we earn from customers who fail to pay us timely. Alternatively, an increase in the price of fuel could lead to higher amounts of receivables or payables we fund, thereby\nincreasing the risk of and our exposure to a failure to pay by our counterparty. See Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cIf we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks posed by our counterparties or there is fraudulent use of our payment cards or systems, we could experience an increase in credit loss and other adverse effects.\u201d\nIn addition to its impact on the price of fuel, the market demand for and supply of fuel and other vehicle products and services may affect the number of transactions or the volume of fuel sold. Fewer gallons sold equates to a lesser purchase price of fuel on which our negotiated percentage revenue is determined. Another of our revenue streams comes from a flat fee derived from a fuel purchase transaction. Accordingly, in a soft fuel demand environment, which could be caused by a number of factors, including higher prices and domestic and global economic conditions, fewer transactions will occur resulting in less revenue to us. The factors that affect the demand for and supply of fuel are beyond our control and include general local, regional, or worldwide economic conditions, the implementation of fuel efficiency standards, legislation and regulation of greenhouse gases, and the development by vehicle manufacturers and adoption by our fleet customers and others of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency, or alternative fuel sources, such as electric, hydrogen, or natural gas powered vehicles, including hybrid vehicles, among other factors. Although alternative fuel vehicles currently make up a small fraction of overall vehicle sales, and the effectiveness of certain alternative fuels usage with various vehicle types is still being developed, there is a trend, which we expect to continue, toward the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, particularly electric vehicles, by fleets. This trend in forecasted uptake in the usage of electric vehicles, while noticeable in North America, is more pronounced in Europe. Therefore, the continued adoption of alternative fuel vehicles by our customers or others, an increase in the speed at which such adoption occurs, or any material expansion in the usage of alternative fuel vehicles to heavier duty vehicles such as over-the-road trucks, could adversely affect our revenues through reduced fossil fuel demand. Moreover, at present, there is a continued trend toward increased vehicle hybridization and increased fuel efficiency of ICE vehicles that may have a negative impact on the amount of fossil fuel sold and, therefore, our revenues. On the supply side, disruptions to supply caused by factors such as geopolitical issues, war (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), weather, climate change, infrastructure, labor shortages, or economic conditions could also affect the amount of fuel purchased by our customers. To the extent that our customers require, or have access to, less fossil fuel, that decline in purchase volume or transactions could reduce our revenues, or any growth in our revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we are unable to develop products and introduce them to the market to service the trend toward alternative fuel vehicles, then we may not be able to replace a decrease in revenue caused by any decrease in fossil fuel volume, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. For further information on how legislation and regulation of greenhouse gases could affect our business and in particular result in the decrease of the volume of fossil fuels sold, see Item 1A - Risk Factors \u201cLegislation and regulation of, and private business actions related to, greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) and related divestment and other efforts could adversely affect our business.\u201d\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of Mastercard or Visa, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations. We process transactions through the Mastercard and Visa networks through WEX Bank and other licensed institutions. If any of these licensed institutions stop or are unable to provide these services to us, we would need to find other appropriate institutions to provide such services.\nA significant source of revenue in our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment, and a small but increasing source of revenue in our Fleet Solutions segment, comes from processing transactions through the Mastercard and Visa networks. Licensing with the Mastercard and Visa schemes is achieved through WEX Bank and its regulated subsidiaries, our regulated and other subsidiaries in Singapore, Japan and Australia, and our Dutch, UK, and Irish licensed e-money institutions. In the case of the Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment, the scheme license is held by a third party sponsor bank. We may from time to time establish additional licensed e-money institutions, regulated subsidiaries or other subsidiaries to license with the Mastercard and Visa schemes as necessary. If our licensed, regulated or other subsidiaries or our third party sponsor bank should stop providing, or are otherwise unable to provide, services, for any reason, or, in the case of our third party sponsor bank, determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms, we would need to find other appropriate institutions to provide those services in the applicable jurisdictions.\nIn addition, Mastercard and Visa routinely update and modify their requirements. Changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to maintain compliance with our license conditions. In addition we have agreed to deliver a certain percentage of our transaction volume in certain of our business areas to certain networks. If we do not comply with Mastercard\u2019s or Visa\u2019s requirements, as the case may be, we could face fines, additional fees, suspensions or termination of registration. Any suspension of a license could limit or eliminate our ability to provide Mastercard or Visa payment processing services in a given jurisdiction, which would materially affect our operations and revenues. Further, the termination of a registration, or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair a registration, could require us to stop providing Mastercard or Visa payment processing services in the applicable jurisdictions. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship, we may no longer be able to provide such payment processing services to affected\ncustomers, which would materially affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA decline in general economic conditions, and in particular, a decline in demand for fuel, travel related services or health care services, and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business and operating results are materially affected by general conditions in the economy, both in the U.S. and internationally. We generate a substantial part of our revenue based on the volume of purchase and other transactions we process. Our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions and the amount of business activity in the economies in which we operate, particularly in the U.S., Europe, the United Kingdom, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and, consequently, reduced demand and use of fuel, travel related services, health care services, CDH accounts, and other business related products and services by our customers or partners and our customers' or partners' customers. The commercial payments industry in general, and our commercial payment solutions business specifically, depend heavily upon the overall level of spending. Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which are typically beyond our control and include declining consumer confidence, increasing unemployment, a restructured workforce and business patterns, inflation, recession, changes in the political climate, war (including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine) or other changes, may lead to a reduction or plateau in spending by those whose spending directly or indirectly contributes to our revenues, resulting in reduced or stagnant demand for, or use of, our products and services. As a result, a sustained decline in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in or limits on interchange fees could decrease our revenue.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants, known as interchange fees, associated with transactions processed using our payment systems, including those using Mastercard or Visa branded cards or using the Mastercard or Visa system. Interchange fee amounts associated with these payment methods are affected by a number of factors, including regulatory limits in certain of the markets in which we operate and fee or program changes imposed or allowed by our third-party partners, including Mastercard and Visa. In addition, interchange fees are continually the subject of intense legal, regulatory, and legislative scrutiny and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate, any of which could result in interchange fees being limited, lowered, or eliminated altogether in any given jurisdiction in the future. Future changes may further restrict or otherwise impact the way we do business or limit our ability to charge certain fees to customers. Moreover, temporary or permanent decreases in, limitations on or elimination of the interchange fees associated with our card or virtual payment transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, effective July 1, 2022, WEX Bank will become subject to the caps on debit card interchange fees set forth in the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. Although WEX Bank\u2019s debit card products are a minimal part of its business at present, the applicability of the Durbin Amendment interchange fee caps may limit the viability or profitability of any prepaid or debit scheme product WEX may want to develop in the future.\nIf we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks posed by our counterparties or there is fraudulent use of our payment cards or systems, we could experience an increase in credit loss and other adverse effects.\nWe are subject to credit risks posed by our counterparties, many of which are small-to mid-sized businesses. Because we often fund a counterparty\u2019s entire receivable or payable, as the case may be, while our revenue is generated from only a small percentage of that amount, our risk of loss is amplified by a counterparty\u2019s failure to pay. Although we use various formulas and models to screen potential counterparties and establish appropriate credit limits, these formulas and models cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not prevent us from approving applications that are fraudulently completed. Moreover, businesses that are good credit risks at the time of application may deteriorate over time and we may fail to detect such changes. In addition, changes to our policies on the types and profiles of businesses to which we extend credit could also have an adverse impact on our credit losses. In times of economic slowdown, the number of our counterparties who default on payments owed to us tends to increase. Inflationary market conditions and rising interest rates may also have an effect on the amount of receivables or payables we fund and our counterparty\u2019s ability to pay. Accordingly, if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks, or if economic conditions affect the businesses of our counterparties or of their customers, credit defaults could increase and our provision for credit losses on the income statement could be significantly higher, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWhen we fund transactions with counterparties, we may also bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or payment systems. We are also subject to risk from fraudulent acts of employees or contractors. Although\nwe maintain insurance for certain types of losses, the coverage may be insufficient or limited and may not fully protect against those losses. Additionally, criminals use sophisticated illegal activities to target us, including \u201cskimming\u201d, counterfeit cards and accounts, and identity theft. A single, significant incident or a series of incidents of fraud or theft could lead to, among other things, increased overall levels of fraud; direct financial losses as a result of fraudulent activity; reputational harm; decreased desirability of our services; greater regulation; increased compliance costs; the imposition of regulatory sanctions; or significant monetary fines. Accordingly, if material fraud, as described above or otherwise, were to occur, the result could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur failure to effectively implement new technology could jeopardize our competitive position.\nAs a global commerce platform, we must constantly adapt and respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our partners, customers, and potential partners and customers, including those related to the Internet and the cloud, in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position. We may not be able to expand our technological capabilities and service offerings as rapidly as our competitors, or at all, which could jeopardize our competitive position.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business environment. Such competition could adversely affect the fees we receive, our revenues and margins, and our ability to gain, maintain, or expand customer relationships, all on favorable terms.\nWe face and expect to continue to face competition in each of our segments from multiple companies that seek to offer competing capabilities and services. Historically, we have been able to provide customers with a wide spectrum of services and capabilities and, therefore, we have not considered price to be the exclusive or even the primary basis on which we compete. As our competitors have continued to develop their service offerings, it has become increasingly more challenging for us to compete solely on the basis of superior capabilities, technology, customer integration or service and price has become an increasingly important decision factor for our customers. In some areas of our business we have been forced to respond to competitive pressures by reducing our fees and our margins. We have seen erosion of our historical profit margins as we encourage existing strategic relationships to sign long-term contracts. If these trends continue and if competition intensifies, our profitability may be adversely impacted.\nOur services are currently focused on the fleet, travel, corporate payments, and health businesses. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have successfully garnered significant share in these businesses. To the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific businesses, they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these businesses.\nWe also face increased competition in our efforts to enter into new customer agreements or strategic relationships, renew or maintain existing agreements or relationships on similar or favorable terms, and grow volumes under existing relationships on favorable terms. For example, the termination of agreements with major oil companies, fuel retailers, and truck stop merchants, would reduce the number of locations where our payment processing services are accepted. As a result, we could lose our competitive advantage and our operating results could be adversely affected. While we regularly monitor these relationships, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain them in the future. In addition, we are also subject to risks as a result of changes in business habits of our vendors and customers as they adjust to the competitive marketplace. Because many of our standing arrangements and agreements with customers or other partners contain no minimum purchase, sale or volume obligations and may be terminable by either party upon no or relatively short notice, customers or other partners may not be required to use the services that we provide to a specific degree or at all, even though we are under contract with them. Accordingly, we are subject to significant risks associated with the loss or change in the business habits and financial condition of these key constituencies as they consider changes in the market or different or less expensive services from competitors or otherwise.\nAs set forth above, the competitive landscape in which we operate could affect our revenues and margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur ability to attract, motivate, and retain qualified employees is critical to our success and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe believe our employees, including our executive leadership team, are our most important resource. The market for workers and leaders of all skill levels in the workplace today, but especially in fintech, technology and other specialized areas, and in the geographic areas in which our operations are centralized, is intensely competitive. We may be unable to attract highly qualified and diverse employees as we grow, retain the individuals we employ, or, as the workplace undergoes a structural shift largely due to the pandemic, to attract other highly qualified and diverse employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms, benefits and conditions that are competitive with the rest of the labor market, which has become more expensive as the competitive nature of the labor market has and will likely continue to drive up labor costs. Failure to attract, hire, develop,\nmotivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture; to make successful hires to fill our leadership ranks and other positions; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of today\u2019s employees and prospective employees, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. These challenges may be further amplified by the ongoing pandemic and its potential resulting requirements, such as prescribed vaccinations or other policies.\nLegislation and regulation of, and private business actions related to, greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) and related divestment and other efforts could adversely affect our business.\nWe are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the U.S. and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. The Biden Administration has made climate change and the limitation of GHG emissions one of its initial and primary objectives. For example, in January 2021, U.S. President Biden signed a number of executive orders with respect to GHGs, including one recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement, pursuant to which nearly 200 nations have committed to reduce global emissions. Several states and geographic regions in the U.S. have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and/or any international agreements to which the U.S. may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our partners\u2019 and our merchants\u2019 operations. Finally, private businesses, including vehicle manufacturers, are increasingly taking proactive steps to control or limit GHG emissions, including by producing vehicles that operate fully using alternative fuels or hybrid electric vehicles. Many auto and truck manufacturers have announced plans to electrify large portions of their fleet over the next decade and the trend toward use of hybrid electric vehicles continues to grow. Because our business is currently heavily reliant on the level of fossil fuels purchased and sold, existing or future laws or regulations or business actions related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if any of the same serve to reduce demand for fossil fuels and we do not or are unable to develop products or relationships to adapt to such potential events. For further information on how the increase in usage of alternative fuels in vehicles affects our business, please see Item 1A - Risk Factors - \u201cA significant portion of our revenues is related to the dollar amount of fuel purchased by or through our customers and from our fuel retailer partners, and, as a result, a reduction in the demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services and/or volatility in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition.\u201d\nIn addition to the regulatory and private sector efforts described above, there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of equities issued by companies connected to fossil fuels as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies similarly connected. If these efforts are successful, and if our business is deemed to be sufficiently tied to the use of fossil fuels by such communities, our ability to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively impacted.\nMembers of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry, including practices related to GHGs and climate change. An increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions, and an increasing number of entities consider sustainability factors in awarding business. If we are unable to appropriately address sustainability enhancement, we may lose customers, partners, or merchants, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to effectively compete.\nWe may never realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions we have completed or may undertake, and we may encounter difficulties in trying to integrate such acquisitions and incur significant expenses or charges as a result of an acquisition.\nThe acquisition and integration of a business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired business.\nIn evaluating and determining the purchase price for a prospective acquisition, we estimate, among other things, the future revenues and profits from that acquisition based largely on historical financial performance as well as any synergies that we believe we may benefit from as a result of the acquisition. Following an acquisition, we may not operate the acquired business as successfully as it was previously operated, or adequately address all of the risks uncovered during the due diligence process. We may also experience some attrition in the number of clients serviced by the acquired business, causing us to not achieve the forecasted revenues and profits from an acquisition or to not achieve the level of synergies that we anticipated when\nentering into an acquisition. Moreover, although we perform a due diligence review of each of our acquisition partners, this review may not adequately uncover all of the contingent, undisclosed, or previously unknown liabilities or risks we may incur as a consequence of the acquisition, exposing us to potentially significant, unanticipated costs, as well as potential impairment charges. An acquisition may also subject us to additional regulatory burdens that may significantly affect our business in unanticipated and negative ways.\nFurther, an acquisition may affect our financial condition in that it may require us to incur other charges, such as severance expenses, restructuring charges or change of control payments, and substantial debt or other liabilities. An acquisition may also cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges, goodwill and other intangible assets, may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that could reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs. These expenses, charges or payments, as well as the initial costs of integrating the personnel and facilities of an acquired business with those of our existing operations, may adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, the process of integrating and operating any acquired business, technology, service or product requires significant management attention and resources and integration may take longer than desired. If we fail to timely or effectively integrate an acquired business, its technology or other assets, this failure may lead to us not achieving certain or all of the desired benefits of the acquisition or may otherwise expose us to any shortcomings or risks of the acquired business, its technology systems or assets prior to their integration into our established systems. Thus, the integration may divert significant management attention from our ongoing business operations and could lead to a disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions.\nWe have been an active acquirer of assets and businesses, and, as part of our growth strategy, we expect to seek to continue to acquire businesses, commercial account portfolios and other assets in the future. We have substantially expanded our overall business, operating segments, customer base, headcount and operations through acquisitions. Our future growth and profitability depend, in part, upon our continued successful expansion within the business segments in which we currently operate. As part of our strategy to expand, we look for acquisition opportunities and partnerships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities.\nAny or all of the following risks could adversely affect our growth strategy, including that:\n\u2022we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets or businesses on favorable terms;\n\u2022we may compete with others to acquire assets or businesses, which competition may increase, and any level of competition could result in decreased availability or increased prices for acquisition candidates;\n\u2022we may compete with others for select acquisitions and our competition may consist of larger, better-funded organizations with more resources and easier access to capital;\n\u2022we may experience difficulty in anticipating the timing and availability of acquisition candidates;\n\u2022we may not be able to obtain the necessary funding, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions; and\n\u2022we may not be able to generate cash necessary to execute our acquisition strategy.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, which could harm both our U.S. and international operations.\nIn addition to our operations in the United States, we conduct operations and use contractors and vendors internationally in many foreign countries. In addition, we are subject to risks from operating internationally, some of which we may not typically encounter in the United States, including:\n\u2022fluctuation in foreign currencies;\n\u2022changes in the relations between the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022actions of foreign or United States governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022increased expense due to the introduction of our corporate policies and controls in our international operations;\n\u2022increased expense related to localization of our products and services, including language translation and creation of localized agreements;\n\u2022increased infrastructure costs, burdens and complexities with respect to legal, tax, accounting and information technology laws, matters, and treaties;\n\u2022interpretation and application of local laws and regulations, including, among others, those impacting anti-money laundering, bribery, financial transaction reporting, privacy, licensing, and positive balance or prepaid cards;\n\u2022enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences due to, but not limited to, the value added tax systems, the repatriation of cash, and any adverse consequences from changes in tax rates and changes or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022competitive pressure on products and services from companies based outside the U.S. that can leverage lower costs of operations;\n\u2022terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022increased expense to comply with U.S. laws that apply to foreign operations, including the FCPA and OFAC regulations;\n\u2022political, social, and economic instability and war; and\n\u2022local labor conditions and regulations.\nWe cannot assure you that our investments, businesses, or operations (including through third parties) outside the United States will produce desired levels of revenue or costs or that they will not be disrupted or affected by one or more of the factors listed above. Any further expansion of our international operations could impose substantial burdens on our resources, divert management\u2019s attention from U.S. operations and otherwise harm our business.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such currencies include, but are not limited to, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, British Pound sterling, the Singapore dollar, and the New Zealand dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions as well as the re-measurement of our cash, receivable and payable balances that are denominated in foreign currencies, are recorded directly in the consolidated statements of operation. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies that we use to conduct our business will affect our revenues, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in those currencies. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU, or Brexit, and the resulting Trade Agreement could adversely affect us.\nThe uncertainty with respect to the ultimate effect on the U.K.\u2019s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU as a result of its departure from the EU, known as Brexit, and the subsequent Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTrade Agreement\u201d) reached between the EU and the UK, could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies that do business with us. Such uncertainties could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or on our customers.\nThe long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the effects and implementation of the Trade Agreement. A withdrawal from the EU, such as Brexit, is unprecedented, and it currently remains unclear how the implementation of the Trade Agreement and the U.K.\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the EU and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations. Since its implementation toward the\nbeginning of 2021 we have not been materially affected by the Trade Agreement, however we cannot be certain that will continue to be the case.\nIn addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our EU and U.K. operations;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of limitations on the interchange fees we are allowed to charge our customers in either the U.K. or the EU; and\n\u2022\nadverse impacts on our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business.\nThese and other factors related to Brexit and the Trade Agreement could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nAs a non-bank custodian WEX Inc. is subject to regulation and noncompliance could render it unable to maintain its non-bank custodian status.\nAs of December 31, 2021, WEX Inc. is the passive non-bank custodian, under designation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, of approximately $3.82 billion of custodial assets for individual HSA holders. WEX Inc. has contracted with federally insured bank depository partners, one of which is its wholly-owned subsidiary, WEX Bank, to hold custodial cash assets from approximately 1.8 million HSA accounts.\nAs a non-bank custodian, WEX Inc. is required to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.408-2(e) (the \u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d), including the net worth and administration of fiduciary duties requirements, among other requirements. If WEX Inc. should fail to comply with the Treasury Regulations, including the net worth and administration of fiduciary duties requirements, such failure would materially and adversely affect its ability to maintain its current custodial accounts and to grow by adding additional custodial accounts, and it could result in the institution of procedures for the revocation of its authorization to operate as a non-bank custodian, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nA business failure in one or more of WEX Inc.\u2019s primary federally insured depository partners, which include WEX Bank, could materially and adversely affect its business.\nAs a non-bank custodian, WEX Inc. relies on various federally insured depository partners, including WEX Bank, to hold custodial cash assets. If any material adverse event were to affect one or more of these depository partners, including a significant decline in financial condition, a decline in the quality of service, loss of deposits, inability to comply with applicable banking and financial services regulatory requirements, or systems failure, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if WEX Inc. were required to change depository partners, we could not accurately predict the success of such change or that the terms of our agreements with such new depository partners would be on equal or better terms as the agreements we have with our current depository partners.\nWe may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets.\nOur goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand, the high level of competition existing within our industry, the level of overall economic activity and other factors. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the Company as a whole. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline, which could adversely affect our operations and cash flow, and could result in an impairment of goodwill. Our reporting units are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or on an interim basis if impairment indicators exist in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. We use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and comparable company pricing multiples to determine the fair value of our reporting units and to determine the amount of any goodwill impairment. In addition, our definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nIf we determine the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value as a result of the annual or interim goodwill tests, or the carrying value of our definite-lived intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset, an impairment loss may be recognized. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations. While we currently believe that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their respective carrying values and that our goodwill will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company, materially different assumptions regarding future\nperformance of our reporting units and the weighted-average cost of capital used in the annual valuation could result in impairment losses. In addition, while we believe that the expected future cash flows to the Company resulting from the use of our definite-lived intangible assets exceeds the carrying value of such assets, material changes in business strategy, customer attrition in excess of expectations, and technological obsolescence could result in impairment losses and/or an acceleration of amortization expense.\nUnpredictable events, including natural catastrophes or public health crises, dangerous weather conditions, technology failure, political unrest, war, and terrorist attacks in the locations in which we or our customers operate, or elsewhere, may adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could impact our financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 global pandemic, other unpredictable events, such as political unrest, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks, power failures, natural disasters (such as wildfires or hurricanes) and severe weather, including conditions arising from climate change could interrupt our operations by causing disruptions in global markets, economic conditions, fuel supply or demand, travel and tourism, and the use of health care services. Such events could also trigger large-scale technology failures, delays, or security lapses. Such events, if continuing or significant, could affect our revenues by reducing the demand for our products and services, by limiting our ability to provide our services or by resulting in security or other issues to our technology systems and the information contained therein. As a result, such events could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe recent Russian military invasion into Ukraine, and the resulting sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and certain other countries, could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and significantly affect worldwide fuel prices and supply, the spreads on fuel transactions, the global demand for travel and the financial health of our customers. These effects could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe healthcare industry changes often and technology-enabled services used by consumers are relatively new and unproven.\nThe market for technology-enabled services for healthcare consumers changes rapidly and new products and services are consistently being introduced. Opportunities to gain market share are challenging due to the significant resources of our existing and potential competitors. It is uncertain whether or how fast this market will continue to grow. In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to develop new services or compete with these new market entrants, including the development of mobile versions of our proprietary technology platform. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of acceptance by our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment customers.\nBased on our experience, consumers are still learning about HSAs and other similar tax-advantaged healthcare savings arrangements. The willingness of consumers to increase their use of technology platforms to manage their healthcare saving and spending tax advantaged benefits will impact our operating results.\nA portion of our Fleet Solutions segment revenue in Europe is derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. As a result, a contraction in these differences would reduce revenues and could adversely affect our operating results.\nRevenue from our European Fleet business is primarily derived from transactions in which our revenue is tied to the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. The merchant\u2019s cost of fuel and the amount we charge to our fleet customer for fuel are dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors described elsewhere in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d affecting fuel prices. We experience fuel price related revenue contraction when the merchant\u2019s cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers, or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant\u2019s cost of fuel. If the foregoing scenarios exist or persist we would generate less revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company is and may in the future become involved in various claims, investigations, and legal proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business and may become involved in legal proceedings that could be material. These proceedings may include, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, stockholder claims, and employment matters. No assurances can be given that any such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in any such proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and\nestablished reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. The types of claims made in such proceedings may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages, specific performance and/or other injunctive or declaratory relief. We may incur significant expenses in defending ourselves in any proceedings and may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. Responding to litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries, and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks related to WEX Bank\nThe loss or suspension of WEX Bank's industrial loan charter or changes in applicable regulatory requirements could be disruptive to certain of our operations, increase costs and increase competition.\nWEX Bank is a Utah industrial bank incorporated in 1998 that operates under an industrial loan charter (ILC). WEX Bank is also an FDIC-insured depository institution. Deposits issued by WEX Bank are currently used to support and fund substantially all of the U.S. and Canadian operations in our Fleet Solutions segment and a substantial portion of the global operations of our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment. WEX Bank's ILC enables it to issue certificates of deposit, accept money market deposits and borrow on federal funds lines of credit from other banks, which we believe provides us access to lower cost funds than many of our competitors, thus helping us to offer competitive products to our customers.\nWEX Bank operates under a uniform set of state lending laws, and its operations are subject to extensive state and federal regulation. The bank\u2019s primary regulators are the Utah DFI and the FDIC. Continued licensing and federal deposit insurance are subject to ongoing satisfaction of compliance and safety and soundness requirements. Adverse changes to its ILC could impact WEX Bank's ability to operate and/or attract funds or limit our ability to provide competitive offerings to our customers. If industrial loan charters were eliminated or if changes to such charters limited or effectively prohibited us from operating as we currently operate, without our operations being \u201cgrandfathered\u201d, we would either need to outsource our credit support activities or perform these activities ourselves, which would subject us to the credit laws of each individual state in which we conduct business. Furthermore, we could not be a Mastercard and/or Visa issuer and would have to work with another financial institution to issue the product or otherwise sell the portfolio. Any such changes would be disruptive to our operations and could result in significant incremental costs and reduce or eliminate any perceived or actual competitive advantage, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, changes in the bank regulatory environment, including the implementation of new or varying measures or interpretations by the State of Utah or the federal government, may significantly affect or restrict the manner in which we conduct business in the future, could subject us to greater regulatory oversight requirements or could create a default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nWEX Bank is subject to extensive supervision and regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business and limit our ability to generate income.\nWEX Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, including that of the FDIC, the CFPB, and the Utah DFI. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders or noteholders. These regulations affect our payment operations, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, damages, civil money penalties or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. The U.S. Congress, federal regulatory agencies and state legislatures and regulatory agencies frequently revise banking and securities laws, regulations and policies. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any other proposed regulations or statutes will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Such changes could subject our business to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing services and products, among other things.\nVolatility or adverse conditions in the economy or credit or other financial markets may negatively impact WEX Bank\u2019s ability to attract and retain deposits.\nVolatility or adverse conditions in the economy or credit or other financial markets may limit WEX Bank\u2019s ability to attract and retain deposits at a time when it would like or need to do so. Currently there are a limited number of industrial banks. Recently, other entities have received ILCs and have begun operating industrial banks and several more have applied for an ILC. If our competitors acquire an ILC and begin to operate an industrial bank, this could increase other entities\u2019 access to these lower cost deposits. In addition, a significant credit rating downgrade, material capital market disruptions, or significant\nwithdrawals by depositors at WEX Bank, among other things, could impact our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and impact our ability to provide competitive offerings to our customers. Further, any such limitation on the availability of deposits to WEX Bank could have an impact on our ability to fund our customers' purchases, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn an environment of increasing interest rates and changes in the deposit market, WEX Bank\u2019s cost of capital would increase.\nWEX Bank uses collectively brokered and non-brokered deposits, including certificates of deposit and interest-bearing money-market deposits, to finance its operations, which primarily involves financing payments on behalf of our customers. Certificates of deposit carry fixed interest rates from issuance to maturity, which vary and are relatively short term in duration. The interest-bearing money market deposits are issued at both fixed and variable rates. Upon maturity, the deposits will likely be replaced by issuing new deposits to the extent that they are needed. In a rising interest rate environment, WEX Bank would not be able to replace maturing deposits with deposits that carry the same or lower interest rates. Therefore, rising interest rates would result in reduced net income to the extent that certificates of deposit and interest-bearing money market deposits mature and are replaced with deposits that carry higher interest rates and we are otherwise unable to increase the fees we otherwise receive under contracts. Rising interest rates could also therefore limit our ability to offer competitive product offerings to our customers. At December 31, 2021, WEX Bank had outstanding $566.4 million in contractual deposits, consisting of certificates of deposit and certain money market deposits that have fixed maturity and interest rates, maturing within one year, $652.2 million in such contractual deposits maturing between one and 3.5 years, $960.0 million in HSA cash assets which have been deposited with WEX Bank by its custodian, WEX Inc., and are invested by WEX Bank in certain financial instruments, and $370.8 million in interest-bearing money market deposits, for an aggregate exposure of $2,549.5 million in deposits at WEX Bank.\nWEX Bank is subject to funding risks associated with its reliance on brokered deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the most recent FDIC exam report categorized WEX Bank as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Under applicable regulations, however, if WEX Bank were to be no longer categorized as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under such framework, it would not be able to finance its operations through the acceptance of brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC and/or could be subject to rate cap on the deposits. WEX Bank\u2019s inability to accept brokered deposits, or a loss of a significant amount of its brokered deposits, could adversely affect its liquidity and therefore its ability to support and fund the Company's operations it currently supports and funds. Additionally, such circumstances could require WEX Bank to raise deposit rates in an attempt to attract new deposits, or to obtain funds through other sources at higher rates, which would affect the Company's ability to offer competitive products to our customers in our segments served by WEX Bank and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWEX Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements that may require us to make capital contributions to WEX Bank and that may restrict WEX Bank's ability to make cash available to us.\nWEX Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. If WEX Bank does not meet these capital requirements, its regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial condition. WEX Bank, as an institution insured by the FDIC, must maintain certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums and adequate allowances for loan losses. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are also required to serve as a source of financial strength for WEX Bank. If WEX Bank were to fail to meet any of the capital requirements to which it is subject, or if required under Dodd-Frank\u2019s source of strength requirements, we may be forced to provide WEX Bank with additional capital, which could impair our ability to service our indebtedness or may not be permitted under the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, substantially all of the transactions of, and therefore the revenues derived from, the U.S. and Canadian operations of our Fleet Solutions segment and the global operations of our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment flow through WEX Bank. Due to the applicable regulatory regime, WEX Bank is limited in the ways it can transfer its cash or other assets to WEX Inc. One of the primary methods by which funds are transferred to WEX Inc. is through the payment of a dividend by WEX Bank to us. However, WEX Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Further, a banking regulator may determine that the payment of dividends would be inappropriate and could impose other conditions on the payment of dividends or even prohibit their payment. Accordingly, WEX Bank may be unable to make any, or may only be able to make limited amounts, of its cash or other assets available to us, which could affect our ability to service our indebtedness, make acquisitions, enhance product offerings, or fund corporate needs, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial condition.\nIf WEX Bank fails to meet certain criteria, we may become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act, which could force us to divest WEX Bank or cease all of our non-banking activities, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and business or could create a default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nWEX Bank currently meets the criteria for exemption of an industrial bank from the definition of \u201cbank\u201d under the Bank Holding Company Act. Elimination of this exemption or WEX Bank\u2019s failure to qualify for this exemption in the future would cause us to become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. This would require us to divest WEX Bank or become a Bank Holding Company and to possibly cease certain non-banking activities which may be impermissible for a Bank Holding Company and could create a default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Failure to qualify for or the elimination of this exemption could thus have an adverse effect on our revenue and business.\nWe are subject to limitations on transactions with WEX Bank, which may limit our ability to engage in transactions with and obtain credit from it.\nSections 23A and 23B of the FRA and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other \u201ccovered transactions\u201d with WEX Bank. \u201cCovered transactions\u201d include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright ban on engaging in \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. The applicable rules also require that we engage in such transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral. Accordingly, WEX Bank may be unable to provide credit or engage in transactions with us, including transactions intended to help us service our indebtedness.\nWEX Bank\u2019s results may be materially and adversely affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.\nIn addition to the risk that we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks posed by our counterparties and the risk that volatility or adverse conditions in the economy or credit or other financial markets may negatively impact us, the value of WEX Bank\u2019s investment of custodial cash assets in securities and other financial instruments can be materially affected by market fluctuations, which could affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nMarket volatility, including, but not limited to interest rate volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuation of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of WEX Bank\u2019s financial instruments, which may have an adverse effect on WEX Bank\u2019s business, financial conditions, results of operations, cost of capital, capital requirements, and ability to fund customer\u2019s withdrawal of depository assets. In addition, at the time of any future disposition of these financial instruments, the price that WEX Bank ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value.\nWEX Bank\u2019s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control WEX Bank\u2019s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, WEX Bank\u2019s risk management strategies may not be effective, and we could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, which could affect our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.9 billion of debt outstanding, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount, including $155.8 million in current liabilities. Such amounts outstanding include obligations under (i) our Convertible Notes, (ii) our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which consists of a tranche A term loan facility, a tranche B term loan facility, and a secured revolving credit facility, and (iii) our securitized and participation debt. In addition to our outstanding debt, as of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit of $51.4 million issued under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We have additional indebtedness in the form of deposits held by WEX Bank and other liabilities outstanding.\nOur substantial indebtedness currently outstanding, or as may become outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness, and the terms and conditions of such indebtedness, could, among other things:\n\u2022lead to difficulty in our ability to generate enough cash flow to satisfy our indebtedness obligations under our credit facilities, and if we fail to satisfy these indebtedness obligations, an event of default could result;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to repaying our indebtedness, thus reducing the amount of funds available to execute on our corporate strategy, to fund working capital or capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds necessary for working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less indebtedness or better access to capital, by, for example, limiting our ability to enter into new markets, upgrade our assets or pursue acquisitions or other business opportunities; and\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business.\nWe may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The Convertible Notes were issued in July 2020, and consist of $310.0 million in initial aggregate principal amount in notes to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC (together with its affiliated entities, \u201cWarburg Pincus\u201d) in a private placement. Under the terms of the Convertible Notes, we may elect to satisfy our bi-annual interest payment obligations through the payment of interest in cash or by increasing the principal amount of the Convertible Notes by an amount equal to any interest we elect to satisfy in kind. As a result, the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes may increase over time. Although, as of the date of this filing, the Company has met its interest payment obligations through the payment of cash, there can be no assurance we will continue to do so in the future. Finally, we had $758.8 million of available borrowing capacity remaining under the revolving credit facility of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021. We are also permitted under our credit facilities to incur additional indebtedness, subject to specified limitations, including compliance with covenants contained in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. If new debt is incurred under any circumstance, the associated risks faced by the Company, such as those set forth above, could intensify.\nFurthermore, the Convertible Notes are convertible by their holders at any time prior to maturity, or earlier redemption or repurchase, based upon an initial conversion price of $200 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock. We may settle conversions of Convertible Notes, at our election, in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. If we are unable, or it is undesirable, due to market or other conditions, to issue shares of common stock to satisfy a conversion request, then we will be required to settle the conversion in cash, which could reduce our cash position to a point that would materially adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition. Moreover, if we are unable to meet any of our principal, interest, or other payment or settlement obligations under any of our debt agreements, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all. Our default on any of our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires that we meet certain financial covenants, including a consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio, as described in Item 8, Note 16, Financing and Other Debt, Debt Covenants. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, create liens over our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, change the nature of our business, enter into certain agreements which restrict our ability to pay dividends or other distributions or create liens on our property, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person.\nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. Failure to comply with the financial covenants or any other non-financial or restrictive covenants in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, for any reason, could create a default. Upon a default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities (except only the requisite lenders under the revolving credit facility and the tranche A term loan facility may accelerate the revolving credit facility due to a breach of the financial covenants), foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which could trigger a default under the Convertible Notes and would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations. The Convertible Notes also contain customary negative and affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, certain covenants placing certain limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and events of default that if breached could allow the requisite noteholders to accelerate the maturity of the\nConvertible Notes, and to exercise their rights and remedies under the Convertible Notes, and could also trigger a cross-default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nFluctuations in interest rates could materially affect the interest expense on our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and an other contingent payment.\nBecause a significant portion of our debt under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. Under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we had $2.5 billion of indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2021, of which approximately 26 percent was at variable interest rates for which we had not entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the future interest payments and reduce interest rate volatility. An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under that portion of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, outstanding interest rate swap contracts are intended to fix the future interest payments associated with $1.9 billion of the $2.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. However, these swap agreements expire at various points prior to the maturity of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including $300 million of swap agreements which expire on December 31, 2022, which we may not be able to effectively replace. If we are able to enter into new swap agreements, such agreements might fix a portion of our interest payments at a rate higher than the expired swaps. Moreover, any swaps we enter into may not be effectively mitigate the risk of increasing interest rates.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement uses LIBOR as a reference rate for our term loans and revolving credit facility, such that the interest due pursuant to such loans may be calculated using LIBOR (subject to a stated minimum value). On July 17, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced that it planned to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month LIBOR tenors (for which publication has now ceased), and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR tenors, including the LIBOR tenors that we use. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, including with respect to the LIBOR tenors that we use, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR's phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR and the potential alternatives at this time are uncertain. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available after June 2023 or if lenders have increased costs due to the phase-out of LIBOR or changes in law, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rate costs on our floating debt rate and our hedging arrangements may not perform as expected.\nSince the above announcements, the Company has taken steps to identify and assess the potential impact of the prospective cessation of LIBOR publication. Some of the Company\u2019s financial instruments have been moved to reference rates other than LIBOR. However, as of December 31, 2021, approximately $1.1 billion in notional value of our swap agreements and the approximately $2.5 billion outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement use LIBOR tenors for which publication ceases in June 2023. As such, our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which was executed in 2021, as well as the affected swap agreements, contain provisions that provide for the transition of the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR under certain circumstances. However, as stated above there is no guarantee that SOFR attains market acceptance. Accordingly, we may need to renegotiate our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the variable rate loans thereunder, and/or our swap agreements, if SOFR does not obtain market acceptance and/or if other LIBOR alternatives are established, which may have the adverse effects set forth above.\nIn addition, the purchase agreement by which WEX Inc. purchased certain contractual rights to serve as custodian or sub-custodian to certain HSAs from HealthcareBank includes certain potential additional consideration payable annually that is calculated on a quarterly basis and is contingent, and based, upon any future increases in the Federal Funds rate. Accordingly, if the Federal Funds rate increases, we may owe the seller under this agreement an amounts equalling up to $225 million. For more information, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Asset Acquisition and HSA Investments.\nWe may want or need to refinance a significant amount of indebtedness or otherwise require additional financings, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance or obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may elect or need to refinance certain of our indebtedness to react to changing economic and business conditions, or for other reasons, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. Moreover, we may need, or want, to raise substantial additional financing to replace maturing debt, or to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our access to lenders in the future is also dependent on, among other things, market conditions, which are variable and potentially volatile, and which could result in increased costs for obtaining and servicing our indebtedness. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nExisting and new laws and regulations and enforcement activities could negatively impact our business and the markets we presently operate in or could limit our expansion opportunities.\nOur operations are subject to substantial regulation both domestically and internationally. In addition, there are often new regulatory efforts which could result in significant constraints and may impact our operations. These existing and emerging laws and regulations can make the expansion or operations of our business very difficult and negatively impact our revenue or increase our compliance costs. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations may result, among other things, in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. Among the regulations that impact us or could impact us are those governing: interchange rates, interest rate and fee restrictions, credit access and disclosure requirements, collection and pricing requirements, compliance obligations, data security and data breach requirements, identity theft avoidance programs, health care mandates, the cost and scope of public and private health insurance coverage, and anti-money laundering compliance programs. We also often must obtain permission from government regulators to conduct business in new locations or in connection with the transfer of licenses for businesses that we acquire. Changes to these regulations, including expansion of consumer-oriented regulation to business-to-business transactions, could materially adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations and could further increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to expand to new markets.\nWe also conduct business with other highly regulated businesses such as banks, payment card issuers, and health insurance providers. These industries are subject to significant potential new regulations, laws, or reforms that could negatively affect these businesses, their ability to maintain or expand their products and services, and the costs associated with doing so. These developments could also negatively impact our business\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and government policies under the Dodd-Frank Act, which may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted into law. Since enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act has generally resulted in increased government regulation and supervision, and including in the regulation of derivatives and capital market activities. The ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act continues to evolve as regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are adopted and further amended, and the text of the Dodd-Frank Act is further analyzed by stakeholders and the courts. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. Derivatives regulations have added costs to our business, and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements or increased regulation of derivative contracts, may add additional costs or may require us to change any fuel price, currency and interest rate hedging practices we may then use to comply with new regulatory requirements. Additionally, we are required to pay to the lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any increased costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Act and other changes in laws, rules or regulations, subject to the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB assumed rulemaking authority under the existing federal consumer financial protection laws, and enforces those laws against and examines certain non-depository institutions and insured depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion and their affiliates. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB is also engaged in rulemaking and regulation of the payments industry, in particular with respect to prepaid cards. The CFPB amended several aspects of its prepaid accounts rule, which became effective on April 1, 2019. The extensive nature of these types of regulations and the implementation dates for any such additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business and our customers. The\nCFPB also has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws, which it has exercised as described in Item 1 under the heading \u201cOther Items - Regulation - United States - The Dodd Frank Act, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission Act, and State UDAP Laws.\u201d It is unclear what future regulatory changes may be promulgated by the CFPB and what effect, if any, such changes would have on our business and operations.\nAs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Government Accountability Office issued its study on the implications of any elimination of the exemption to the definition of \u201cbank\u201d for industrial banks under the Bank Holding Company Act. The study did not make a recommendation regarding the elimination of this exemption. However, if this exemption were eliminated without any grandfathering or accommodations for existing institutions, we could be required to become a bank holding company which could prompt us to either cease certain activities or divest WEX Bank.\nWEX Inc., and its U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar state laws and regulations, which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The Federal Trade Commission Act applies to all businesses operating in the United States, and WEX Bank is subject to FDIC jurisdiction as it relates to the Federal Trade Commission Act.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations creates additional compliance costs and reputational risk.\nThe applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which WEX operates impose significant anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence obligations on the local entities, including WEX Bank, WEX Payments, Inc., WEX Europe UK Limited, Optal Financial Europe Limited, Optal Financial Limited, and WEX Europe (Netherlands) B.V., as well as our other regulated subsidiaries. We must verify the identity of customers, monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, and refrain from transacting with designated persons or in designated regions, in each case as required by the applicable laws and regulations (such as the Bank Secrecy Act and regulations of the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service regulations in the United States, the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulations 2019 in the U.K. and the Act on Financial Supervision in the Netherlands). Financial regulators have issued various implementing regulations and have made enforcement a high priority. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and other serious legal and reputational consequences, including restrictions on regulated subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take on new business, which may impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nLaws or regulations developed in one jurisdiction or for one product could result in new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or for other products.\nRegulators often monitor other approaches to the governance of the payment industry. As a result, a law or regulation enacted in one jurisdiction could result in similar developments in another. In addition, law and regulation involving one product could influence the extension of regulations to other product offerings.\nThe expansion of certain regulations could negatively impact our business in other geographies or for other products. Rules and regulations concerning interchange and business operations regulations, for example, may differ from country to country which adds complexity and expense to our operations.\nThese varying and increasingly complex regulations could limit our ability to globalize our products and could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulations and industry standards intended to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services and expose us to liability for security incidents involving personal information.\nGovernmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. For example, in the United States, all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information. In November 2021, U.S. federal banking regulators issued a final rule effective April 1, 2022, that requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulators within 36 hours of certain computer security incidents. The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act, which will expand the CCPA when it becomes effective on January 1, 2023, impose additional restrictions on the collection, processing and disclosure of personally-identifiable data, including imposing breach reporting requirements and increased penalties on data privacy incidents. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado adopted their own comprehensive privacy laws, which will take effect in 2023. Several other states are considering privacy legislation during their 2022 legislation sessions. In Europe, the adoption of General Data Protection Regulation (commonly referred to as GDPR) also requires additional privacy protections and extends the scope of the EU data protection laws to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the\ncompany\u2019s location. In connection with providing services to our clients, we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as payment card industry standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines. The compliance standards relate to our infrastructure and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information received from our customers. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental enforcement proceedings. In addition, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients. If more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level, our compliance costs may increase, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security and data privacy breaches may increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. For example, the 2017 Tax Act enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligation and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nEvolution and expansion of our business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, for which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\nThe evolution and expansion of our business may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements, including laws governing money transmission and payment processing services. These requirements vary throughout the markets in which we operate, and have increased over time as the geographic scope and complexity of our payments product services have expanded. While we maintain a compliance program focused on applicable laws and regulations throughout the payments industry, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, criminal and civil lawsuits or other regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements.\nIn order to maintain flexibility in the growth and expansion of our payments operations, we have registered as a money service business with FinCEN and have obtained money transmitter licenses (or their equivalents) in most states and expect to continue the license application process in additional jurisdictions throughout the United States as needed to accommodate new product development. Our efforts to acquire and maintain these licenses could result in significant management time, effort, and cost, and may still not guarantee compliance given the constant state of change in these regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, costs associated with changes in compliance requirements, regulatory audits, enforcement actions, reputational harm, or other regulatory limits on our ability to grow our payment processing business could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur increased presence in foreign jurisdictions increases the possibility of foreign law violations or violation of the FCPA and the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cUKBA\u201d), as we own subsidiaries organized under UK law, which serve as holding companies for other subsidiaries. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The UKBA is broader in its reach and prohibits bribery in purely commercial contexts in addition to bribery of government officials, and it does not allow certain exceptions that are permitted by the FCPA. Other countries in which we operate or have operated, including Brazil, and other countries where we intend to operate, also have anti-corruption laws, which we are, have been or will be subject to.\nOur employees and agents interact with government officials on our behalf, including as necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business. We also have a number of contracts with third-parties that are owned or controlled by foreign governments. These interactions and contracts create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA, UKBA or other similar laws, we could be held liable for such unauthorized actions taken by our employees or agents.\nIn recent years, there have been significant regulatory reviews and actions taken by the United States and other regulators related to anti-bribery laws, and the trend appears to be applying greater scrutiny around payments to, and relationships with, foreign entities and individuals, and companies\u2019 controls and procedures related to compliance with anti-bribery laws.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees, agents and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and UKBA, such policies or procedures may not work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our employees, agents and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. In the event that we believe, or have reason to believe, that our employees, agents or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of the FCPA, the UKBA or similar laws and regulations, can result in significant expenses, require implementation of new and additional controls and procedures, divert management attention, and otherwise have a negative impact on us. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, UKBA or laws of any other jurisdiction can subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The possibility of violations of the FCPA, UKBA or other similar laws or regulations may increase as we expand globally and into countries with recognized corruption problems.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Technology\nOur business is regularly subject to cyberattacks and we may not be able to adequately protect our information systems, including the data we collect, which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation. Our efforts to implement robust security measures and comply with applicable data privacy laws are costly and time-consuming and they may not provide absolute security against cyberattacks, security breaches or unauthorized access.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose an ongoing risk to the security of our information systems and networks. Although we have security measures in place to address and mitigate cyber-related risks, we have experienced cyber attacks and expect we will continue to experience additional attacks in the future. Although we have not experienced a material loss from such an attack to date, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such a loss in the future.\nWe collect and store sensitive data about third parties, including healthcare related information, bank account information, and spending data. We are expected to keep this information in our confidence. The information we collect often includes social security numbers and tax identification numbers. As a result of applicable laws, we are required to take commercially reasonable measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyberattacks, as well as the unauthorized access, acquisition, release and use of \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d such as social security numbers. While social security numbers and tax identification numbers constitute only a part of the data we keep, in the event of a security breach we are required to determine the types of information compromised and determine corrective actions and next steps under applicable laws, which requires us to expend capital and other resources to address the security breach and protect against future breaches. In addition, as outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data and cloud storage solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and there is a risk that the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data held by, or accessible to, third parties, including merchants that accept our cards, payment processors and our business partners, may be materially compromised, which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to such an incident. In addition, high profile data breaches could change consumer behaviors, impact our ability to access data to make product offers and credit decisions, result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements, and result in increases in our compliance and monitoring costs.\nThe techniques used in attempts to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or our customers\u2019 data, to degrade service, or to sabotage our systems are constantly evolving, are difficult to detect quickly, and may not be recognized until after a successful penetration of our information security systems. Cyber threats include, but are not limited to: malicious software; destructive malware; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data; disruption to operations or critical systems; denial of service attacks; unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise\nprotected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners); corruption or encryption of data, networks or systems; harm to individuals; and loss of assets. Unauthorized parties attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, targeting our systems or facilities or our third-party vendors or customers, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. We have developed robust systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and we will continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections. However, these security measures cannot provide absolute security and may be insufficient, circumvented or become obsolete.\nAny actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations; result in our systems or services being unavailable; result in platform, information and network shutdowns; result in improper disclosure of data; materially harm our reputation and brand; result in significant legal and financial exposure; lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services; and, adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any breaches of network or data security at our partners, some of whom maintain information about our customers, or breaches of our customers\u2019 systems could have similar effects. In addition, our customers could have vulnerabilities on their own computer systems that are entirely unrelated to our systems, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. While we take commercially appropriate steps to safeguard data used by and contained on the systems of our partners, customers and vendors, we cannot control all access to those systems and they are therefore subject to the risk of cyberattacks and fraud.\nUnder the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLBA, and some state laws, we and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to consumer information. This requirement generally does not extend to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes.\nThe GLBA also requires us and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we or WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about consumers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, we and WEX Bank must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to \u201copt out\u201d of any such disclosure. In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures, such as the CCPA and CPRA, governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases, these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, we and WEX Bank must monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our businesses.\nWhen we handle individually identifiable health information, regulations issued under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, our contracts with our customers, and supplemental state laws require us to implement privacy and data security measures and to comply with breach notification requirements. We may be subject to contractual damages and civil or criminal penalties if we are found to violate these privacy, security and breach notification requirements. An amendment to the HITECH Act enacted in January 2021 will require consideration of a company's implementation of recognized security standards in assessing administrative fines and penalties under the HIPAA security standards. This action will potentially heighten enforcement risks if we fail to adequately implement the recognized security standards, while mitigating such risks if the recognized measures are successfully implemented.\nOur efforts to comply with existing and future health and financial data laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, are costly and time-consuming. In addition, any cybersecurity incident, any incident involving our handling of protected and sensitive information, failure to comply with applicable breach notification and reporting requirements, or any violation of international, federal or state privacy laws could consume significant financial and managerial resources, expose us to liability in excess of any applicable insurance policies, litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and/or cause damage to our reputation which may discourage customers from using, renewing, or expanding their use of our services or cause us to be in breach of our contracts with them. We may also be required to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures or to modify the features and functionality of our system offerings in a way that is less attractive to customers.\nIf the technologies we use in operating our business and interacting with our customers fail, are unavailable, or do not operate to expectations, or we fail to successfully implement technology strategies and capabilities in connection with our outsourcing arrangements, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies, including third-party owned and operated \u201ccloud\u201d technologies or third-party managed technology platforms, data-centers, and processing systems, to conduct our business and interact with our customers, partners and suppliers, among others. This includes technology that we have developed, have contracted with others to develop, have outsourced to a single provider to operate or have obtained through third-parties by way of service agreements. As we have increased the number of platforms as well as the size of our networks and information systems, our reliance on these technologies has become increasingly important to our operating activities.\nThe potential negative impact that a platform, network or information system shutdown may have on our operating activities has increased. To the extent that our proprietary technology or a third-party providers\u2019 technology does not work as agreed to or as expected, or if we experience outages or unavailability resulting from ours or our third-party providers\u2019 operations and the services provided, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver services could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Shutdowns may be caused by cyberattacks or unexpected catastrophic events such as natural disasters or other unforeseen events, such as software or hardware defects, including defects in software or hardware provided by third party vendors. Any failure by our customers or partners to access the technology that we develop internally could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we make substantial investments in technology, there is no guarantee that it will function as intended once it is placed into operation. Lastly, given our reliance on technology, we regularly assess our technology plans, including both platforms and technology infrastructure. To the extent that we conclude that certain technologies should be retired, that existing platforms should be consolidated, or that we should change our technology strategies, we may be required to impair or accelerate depreciation on certain assets. Any of these potential changes or failures in our technology strategies may also divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Fleet business is dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent service disruptions.\nOur ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to electronically communicate with our fuel and vehicle maintenance providers through point-of-sale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties. The electronic communications networks upon which we depend are often subject to disruptions of various magnitudes and durations. Any severe disruption of one or more of these networks could impair our ability to authorize transactions or collect information about such transactions, which, in turn, could harm our reputation for dependable service and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our ability to collect enhanced data relating to our customers\u2019 purchases may be limited by the use of older point-of-sale devices by fuel and vehicle maintenance providers. To the extent that fuel and vehicle maintenance providers within our network are slow to adopt advanced point-of-sale devices, we may not be able to offer the latest services and capabilities that our customers demand.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe failure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could result in the inability to accurately report our financial results or prevent material misstatement due to fraud, which could cause current and potential shareholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting, adversely affect the trading price of our securities, harm our operating results, trigger a default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or result in regulatory proceedings against us.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. The failure to develop or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could harm our reputation or operating results, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or trigger a default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nOur financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are reliant, in part, on information we receive from disparate internal financial reporting systems and third parties that supply information to us regarding transactions that we process. In addition, because our strategy includes pursuing growth through acquisitions of other businesses, which are at different levels of maturity and which may have underdeveloped financial reporting systems and processes, we depend on dispersed financial systems to process, summarize and report financial transactions for our distributed operations. To the extent these systems do not properly transmit information to our financial ledgers, we could fail to properly summarize and report financial results.\nAs we expand our business operations domestically and internationally, and as we implement new accounting standards promulgated by the FASB, we will need to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to do so, our external auditors could issue a qualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIneffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities or affect our ability to access the capital markets and could result in regulatory proceedings against us by, among others, the SEC. WEX recently settled an investigation by the SEC with respect to the revision of WEX\u2019s financial statements noted in its Annual Report on Form 10K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to issues involving WEX\u2019s formal Brazil subsidiary. For more information about this settlement, please see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nMaterial weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have in the past and could in the future lead to deficiencies in the preparation of financial statements. Deficiencies in the preparation of financial statements, could lead to litigation claims against us. The defense of any such claims may cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor. Any litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. Such events could also affect our ability to raise capital to fund future business initiatives.\nProvisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, applicable banking laws and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, a classified board of directors (which as a result of last year\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders will be fully declassified commencing with the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders), the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, advance notice requirements for raising business or making nominations at meetings of stockholders and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such special dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, and rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the common stock, as our board of directors may determine. In addition, under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the indenture, and which includes, among other things, certain change of control transactions with respect to the Company), holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to the sum of (i) 105 percent of then accreted principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued interest and (ii) the sum of the present values of the scheduled remaining payments of interest had such Convertible Notes remained outstanding through maturity. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock or change control of our board of directors. We also are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could delay, deter or prevent us from entering into an acquisition, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder unless specific conditions are met. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nIn addition, under Utah banking law, no entity may (i) acquire direct or indirect control of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities, or (ii) vote such amount of shares, without first receiving the formal written approval of Utah DFI\u2019s commissioner. Utah law grants the commissioner up to 60 days (which may be lengthened or shortened) within which to issue findings of fact, conclusions, and an order with respect to an application. Finally, the law grants the commissioner broad authority to disapprove of any application for a number of enumerated reasons.\nFederal banking law also prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of us unless the FDIC has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction within 60 days, unless the FDIC extends the review period. Under the FDIC\u2019s regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of our voting stock would generally create a rebuttable presumption of control. Federal law further prohibits any person who has not previously received approval from acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d at 25% or more of a class of our voting stock unless the FDIC has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction within 60 days unless the FDIC extends the review period. Any person filing a notice must publish an announcement seeking public comment and the FDIC has the authority to disapprove of the notice for a number of reasons. In addition, the FDIC recently adopted regulations that impose additional requirements on certain investors that are not subject to consolidated supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before such investors may acquire 10% or more of a class of our voting stock. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, entering into one or more agreements with the FDIC that (i) impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on such investors, (ii) allow the FDIC to examine such investors and (iii) require such investors to maintain capital and liquidity at WEX Bank above certain minimum levels.\nFinally, our certificate of incorporation requires that if any stockholder fails to provide us with satisfactory evidence that any required approvals have been obtained, we may, or will if required by state or federal regulators, restrict such stockholder\u2019s ability to vote such shares with respect to any matter subject to a vote of our stockholders.\nThe requirements that an investor generally must obtain the prior approval or non-objection of the Utah DFI and the FDIC in order to acquire 10% or more of our common stock may preclude,delay or dissuade the purchase of a relatively large ownership stake by potential investors. Further, as a result of these requirements, certain existing and potential stockholders may choose not to invest in our stock at all or invest further in our stock. This could limit the number of potential investors and impact our ability to attract further funds.\nThe issuance by us of additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities, including in connection with conversions of our outstanding Convertible Notes, may cause dilution to our stockholders.\nTo the extent that we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders may be diluted. In July 2020, we issued $310.0 million in initial aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes and $90.0 million of our common stock to Warburg Pincus in a private placement. The Convertible Notes are convertible by the holders at any time prior to maturity, or earlier redemption or repurchase, based upon an initial conversion price of $200 per share of common stock. We may settle conversions of Convertible Notes, at our election, in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes is subject to increase, including as a result of our ability to elect to satisfy interest obligations under the Convertible Notes by increasing the principal amount of the Convertible Notes rather than paying cash interest and as a result of adjustments to the conversion price under the Convertible Notes in connection with certain events. The conversion price is subject to adjustments customary for convertible debt securities and is also subject to a weighted average adjustment in the event of issuances of equity and equity linked securities by the Company at prices below the then applicable conversion price for the Convertible Notes or the then market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to certain exceptions, including exceptions for underwritten offerings, Rule 144A offerings, private placements at discounts not exceeding a specified amount, issuances as acquisition consideration and equity compensation related issuances. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our conversion obligations under the Convertible Notes, our stockholders will experience dilution. Our ability to settle conversions of Convertible Notes in cash may be limited, including as a result of our available cash resources at the time of any conversions and as a result of restrictions in our then existing debt agreements on our ability to satisfy conversions in cash (for example, pursuant to restricted payment covenants similar to those contained in our existing debt agreements).\nIn addition to potential dilution that may result from the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes, our stockholders may also experience additional dilution as a result of other future issuances by us of common stock or equity-linked securities, whether issued in financing transactions, in connection with acquisitions, pursuant to equity compensation plans or otherwise. Pursuant to the purchase agreement entered into with Warburg Pincus in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we provided Warburg Pincus with certain contractual preemptive rights allowing it to maintain its proportionate equity interest on an as-converted basis, subject to certain exceptions, in connection with certain future issuances by us of common stock or other equity-linked securities.\nThe sale or other dispositions of significant amounts of our outstanding common stock into the public market in the future, or the perception that sales or other dispositions could occur, could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our July 2020 private placement with Warburg Pincus, we filed a registration statement registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Convertible Notes and the shares of common stock issued in the private placement and issuable pursuant to conversions of the Convertible Notes. The purchase agreement for the Convertible Notes provides that Warburg Pincus be restricted from transferring the Convertible Notes or shares of common stock issued in the private placement or upon conversion of the Convertible Notes until July 1, 2021, subject to certain exceptions (including, among other exceptions, transfers pursuant to pledge arrangements that may be entered into by Warburg Pincus in connection with certain financing arrangements). Currently, transfers by Warburg Pincus generally are not restricted, subject to certain limitations on transfers to certain categories of transferees. The sale or other dispositions of a substantial number of our shares by Warburg Pincus or other holders of our common stock or the Convertible Notes, or the market perception that such sales or other dispositions may occur, could have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90569, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "WEX"}
