RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks, which we believe are the principal risks that we face and of which we are currently aware, and all of the other information in this report. Should any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face the following risks in connection with the general conditions and trends of the industry in which we operate:\nWe are dependent on the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business, and the outlook for U.S. Government spending is uncertain.\nApproximately 78% of our 2014 revenues were derived from products and services ultimately sold to the U.S. Government, primarily defense-related programs with the Department of Defense (DoD). Our sales are affected by and dependent on the federal budget and related federal spending levels. Federal spending is affected by numerous factors, including our nation\u2019s national security posture and the perceived threat environment, macroeconomic conditions, changes in U.S. procurement policies, presidential administration priorities, and the ability of the U.S. Government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills. Any of these factors could result in a significant redirection of current and future DoD budgets and impact our future operations and cash flows.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act) provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets and mandated substantial additional spending reductions through a process known as \u201csequestration.\u201d The sequestration spending reductions required for defense were approximately $43 billion for fiscal year 2013, increasing to approximately $55 billion for fiscal year 2014 and beyond. The combined effect of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 is a substantial alteration of sequestration in the near term. Though combined sequestration cuts of $55 billion were triggered in fiscal year 2013, there were no additional cuts, across the board cuts or sequestration in fiscal year 2014. Congress enacted a fiscal year 2014 appropriations bill implementing the defense and non-defense caps. Congress also enacted a more comprehensive CR-Omnibus appropriations measure for fiscal year 2015 which adhered to the $1.014 trillion combined discretionary spending caps and thus avoided triggering sequestration. By incorporating these alterations to the original Budget Control Act, the Congressional Budget Office still anticipates achievement of $539 billion in discretionary spending reductions from fiscal year 2016 to 2021.\nThe U.S. Government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities, which may shift DoD budgetary priorities and reduce overall U.S. Government spending. In addition, changes to the DoD acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so. Overall, we expect that top-line defense spending will decline over the next several years. Such funding cuts will likely have an impact across the DoD budget. Such reductions in U.S. Government spending and policy could have a material impact on our business.\nWe cannot predict the impact on existing, follow-on, replacement or future programs from potential changes in priorities due to changes in U.S. Government spending levels, military strategy and planning and/or changes in social-political priorities. A shift in government priorities to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Known Trends and Uncertainties.\u201d\nPage |\nThe termination of government contracts may adversely affect our business.\nOur financial performance is dependent on our performance under our U.S. Government contracts. The U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. Government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. The termination of any of our government contracts, whether for convenience or default, may adversely affect our current programs and may reduce our revenue, earnings or cash flows.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. Government audit or investigation.\nU.S. Government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements. These regulations and requirements, although customary in government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. If any such regulations or procurement requirements change, our costs of complying with them could increase and therefore reduce our margins.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting systems, purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and control systems, cost estimating systems, compensation systems and management information systems. Any costs found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension, or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. Government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate or if it believes it is in the government\u2019s best interests during a dispute. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nThe U.S. Government, from time to time, may require its contractors to reduce certain contract prices, or may disallow costs allocated to certain contracts. These adjustments can involve substantial amounts. In the past, as a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries, we have on occasion made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts.\nWe are also, from time to time, subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our operations, and we are subject to or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws, including but not limited to the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, Cost Accounting Standards, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated the law, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines, compensatory or treble damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such findings or convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting. Given our dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nPage |\nCompetition within our markets may reduce our revenue and market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. The recent defense industry downturn has led to increased competition and we expect this heightened degree of competition to continue. In addition, as discussed above, projected U.S. defense spending levels for periods beyond the near-term are uncertain and difficult to predict. Changes in U.S. defense spending may limit certain future market opportunities. We are also facing increasing competition in our domestic and international markets from foreign and multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for technology and support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, we may experience declines in revenue and market share which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Known Trends and Uncertainties.\u201d\nMany of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.\nWe design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements.\nIn addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. Examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or property. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, liquidated damages, penalties and repayment to the customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received.\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAccounting for our contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, judgments associated with estimating contract revenues and costs, and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, we must make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented; incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates, and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nPage |\nThe level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nA substantial portion of Exelis\u2019 current and retired employee population is covered by defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, \u201cdefined benefit plans\u201d). We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to defined benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our defined benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves various factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, rates of future compensation increases, mortality of plan participants and trends for future medical costs. Management develops each assumption using relevant plan and Company experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.\nWe make contributions to fund our defined benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the return on defined benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall defined benefit plans could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.\nU.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. As a result, we have sought and expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the U.S. Government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions.\nOn December 27, 2011 the U.S. Government\u2019s Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) published a final rule that harmonizes Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost reimbursement rules with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) funding requirements. The rule is expected to eventually mitigate the mismatch between CAS costs and PPA-amended ERISA minimum funding requirements, and result in an acceleration of allowable CAS pension costs as compared to the prior rules. The final rule applied to our contracts starting in 2013, although due to a five-year phase in, the rule will not begin to have a material impact on cost reimbursement until 2015, with full phase-in not achieved until 2017. We anticipate that government contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional CAS contract costs resulting from the final rule.\nCost growth on contracts that is not recoverable from our customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.\nOur operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers. This cost growth can occur if estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges, manufacturing difficulties or delays, or workforce-related issues, or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract cost were incorrect. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the timeliness and availability of materials, major subcontractor performance and quality of their products, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nMost of our contracts are fixed-price contracts or flexibly priced contracts. Our risk varies with the type of contract. Flexibly priced contracts include both cost-plus and time-and-material contracts. Due to their nature, fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. Approximately 53% of our total revenue was derived from fixed-price contracts for the year ended December 31, 2014. We typically enter into fixed-price contracts where costs can be reasonably estimated based on experience. In addition, our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights. If the terms specified in our contracts are not met, then profitability may be reduced. Fixed-price development work comprises a small portion of our firm fixed-price contracts and inherently has more\nPage |\nuncertainty as to future events than production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage. As work progresses through the development stage into production, the risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract are generally reduced. In addition, successful performance of firm fixed-price development contracts that include production units is subject to our ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates. While management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed-price development contracts, future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates.\nUnder cost-plus contracts the allowable costs incurred by the contractor are subject to reimbursement plus a fee that represents profit. We enter into cost-plus contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges. These cost-plus programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise.\nOur earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs.\nOur earnings and margins may vary depending on the types and timing of long-term government contracts undertaken, the nature of the products produced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined (particularly under award and incentive fee contracts).\nOur backlog includes a variety of contract types which are intended to address changing risk and reward profiles as a program matures. Contract types include fixed price, cost-plus, fixed-price incentive, and time-and-material contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price despite the actual costs we incur. We have to absorb any costs in excess of the fixed price. Under cost-plus contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance-based. In these cases, the associated financial risks primarily relate to a reduction in fees, and the program could be cancelled if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise. Under a fixed-price incentive contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement, but are subject to a cost-share limit which affects profitability. If our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs incurred and may have our fees reduced or eliminated. Under time-and-material contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses.\nContracts for development programs that have complex design and technical challenges are typically cost-plus. Other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production (e.g., Low Rate Initial Production), which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated. These may be fixed price, cost-plus or fixed-price incentive contracts. There are also contracts for production as well as operations and maintenance of the delivered products that have the challenge of achieving a stable production and delivery rate, while maintaining operability of the product after delivery. These contracts are mainly fixed-price, although some operations and maintenance contracts are time-and-material contracts.\nThe failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or claims made against us by our customers and affect our financial performance in that period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards.\nOur earnings and margins depend, in part, on our ability to perform under contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events, many of which extend over long periods. These projections assess the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, and the timing of product deliveries. If there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we face unanticipated contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected.\nPage |\nOur earnings and margins depend, in part, on subcontractor performance as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.\nWe rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major components for our products and we rely on subcontractors to produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies and perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are unable to provide the agreed-upon products or materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nOur costs may increase over the term of our contracts. Through cost escalation provisions contained in some of our contracts, we may be protected from increases in material costs to the extent that the increases in our costs are in line with industry indices. However, the difference in basis between our actual material costs and these indices may expose us to cost uncertainty even with these provisions. A significant delay in supply deliveries of our key raw materials required in our production processes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn connection with our government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. There are currently several components for which there may be only one supplier. The inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks.\nOur international business constituted approximately 19% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in regulation or political environment may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.\nThe services and products we provide internationally, including through the use of subcontractors, are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, in areas of military conflict or at military installations. This increases the risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties. We maintain insurance to mitigate risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations, but our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover these claims and liabilities and we may bear substantial costs arising from those claims. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but any one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and new technologies and maintain technologies, facilities, equipment and a qualified workforce to meet the needs of current and future customers.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop and market our products and services. If we fail to maintain our competitive position, we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share.\nOur operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills and/or security clearances. If qualified personnel become scarce, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees or could experience difficulty in performing under our contracts if the needs for such employees are unmet.\nPage |\nUnforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, new restrictions on materials used in our operations. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require significant operating and capital costs.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to remediation of conditions in the environment. In addition, if violations of environmental laws result in our, or in one or more facilities, being placed on the \u201cExcluded Parties List\u201d maintained by the General Services Administration, we could become ineligible to receive certain contracts, subcontracts and other benefits from the federal government or to perform work under a government contract or subcontract at any listed facility. Generally, such ineligibility would continue until the basis for the listing has been appropriately addressed.\nDevelopments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments under previously priced contracts, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe rely on our information systems in our operations. Security breaches and other disruptions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including cyber-security threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, and threats to physical security. Cyber-security threats are evolving and include, among others, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our operations, lead to financial losses from remedial actions, require significant management attention and resources, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur systems are decentralized, which presents various risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than we would be in a more centralized environment. In addition, \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives, such as the integration of information technology systems, or the formation of a technology system impacting different parts of our business, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMisconduct of our employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners could cause us to lose customers or our ability to obtain new contracts.\nMisconduct, fraud or other improper activities by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities, and any other applicable laws or regulations. Misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer\u2019s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. Other examples of potential misconduct include falsifying time or other records and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. Although we\nPage |\nhave implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, our reputation and our future results.\nOur level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $650 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt, including $250 million of 4.25% senior notes due in 2016 and $400 million of 5.55% senior notes due in 2021. In addition, at December 31, 2014, we had borrowing capacity of $500 million available to us under our bank credit facility. In the future, we may increase our borrowings, subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense technology industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial health, and may decrease our profitability.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock, the terms of the debt or our preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your percentage ownership in us would decline. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect your investment in us.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and could also have a material adverse effect on the market value of the our common stock and outstanding debt securities.\nPage |\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, our goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $2.1 billion, net of accumulated amortization, which represented approximately 44% of our total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We also review the carrying value of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators arise. We estimate the fair value of reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test using an income approach, and as a result the fair value measurements depend on revenue growth rates, future operating margin assumptions, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and identification of appropriate market comparable data. Because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive security clearance and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information, trade secrets and intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.\nWe own many U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property. The U.S. Government has rights to use certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual property. Our intellectual property is subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties.\nWe also rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not protected by patents. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors and other parties, as well as through other security measures. These agreements and security measures may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented proprietary information. In the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nIn some instances, we have licensed the proprietary intellectual property of others, but we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms.\nUnanticipated changes in our provision for income taxes or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nPage |\nAdditionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability.\nSome of our workforce is represented by labor unions so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.\nApproximately 1,100 of our employees are unionized, which represents approximately 11% of our employee-base at December 31, 2014. As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe effects of changes in worldwide political, social, economic and capital markets conditions may significantly affect our revenue, profitability, results of operations and our ability to maintain liquidity or procure capital.\nOur business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. If, for any reason, we lose access to our currently available lines of credit, or if we are required to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so in the current credit and stock market environment, or we may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms.\nAdverse changes to financial conditions could jeopardize certain counterparty obligations, including those of our insurers and financial institutions and other third parties. The tightening of credit markets may reduce the funds available to our customers to buy our products and services for an unknown, but perhaps lengthy, period. Restrictive credit markets may also result in customers extending times for payment and may result in our having higher customer receivables with increased default rates. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and foreign economies may also cause customers to reduce consumption even in a stable marketplace.\nOur proposed merger with Harris may cause disruption in our business and, if the proposed merger does not occur, we will have incurred significant expenses, may need to pay a termination fee under the merger agreement and our stock price may decline.\nOn February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Harris Corporation (\u201cHarris\u201d) under which the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris when the transaction closes. Under the merger agreement, at the time of the merger, all issued and outstanding shares of Exelis common stock will be canceled and Exelis shareholders will receive $16.625 in cash and 0.1025 of a share of Harris common stock for each share of Exelis common stock they own. Upon closing, Harris shareholders will own approximately 85 percent of the combined company and Exelis shareholders will own approximately 15 percent. The proposed merger has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and Exelis shareholder approval. There are no assurances that the proposed merger with Harris will be consummated on the expected timetable, or at all.\nThe announcement of the proposed merger, whether or not consummated, may result in a loss of key personnel and may disrupt our sales, strategic growth initiatives, research and development, or other key business activities, which may have an impact on our financial performance. The merger agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed merger, but includes certain contractual restrictions on the conduct of our business that may affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial goals. Additionally, the announcement of the proposed merger, whether or not consummated, may impact our relationships with third parties, including collaboration with partners, suppliers, customers and others.\nAs more fully described in Note 21, \"Proposed Merger\" to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the completion of the proposed merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others: (1) the approval of the merger agreement by Exelis\u2019 shareholders; (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (3) receipt of required regulatory approvals,\nPage |\nincluding all consents required to be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to communications laws in connection with the merger; (4) the absence of certain legal impediments preventing the consummation of the merger; (5) the approval by the New York Stock Exchange of the listing the shares of Harris common stock issuable to Exelis shareholders under the merger agreement; (6) the effectiveness of the registration on Form S-4 to be filed by Harris relating to the shares of Harris common stock to be issued in the merger; (7) the truth of the representations and warranties of the parties and the compliance of the parties with their respective covenants, subject to customary qualifications including with respect to materiality; and (8) the absence of a material adverse effect occurring with respect to Exelis.\nWe cannot predict whether the closing conditions for the proposed merger set forth in the merger agreement will be satisfied. As a result, we cannot assure you that the proposed merger will be completed. If the closing conditions for the proposed merger set forth in the merger agreement are not satisfied or waived pursuant to the merger agreement, or if the transaction is not completed for any other reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if the proposed merger does not occur, we will nonetheless remain liable for significant expenses that we have incurred related to the transaction. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be required to pay Harris a termination fee of up to approximately $138 in cash.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-off of Vectrus\nWe face the following risks in connection with spin-off of Vectrus.\nWe may be responsible for U.S. Federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off of Vectrus\nIn connection with the spin-off of Vectrus we received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made in the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinion. Furthermore, the opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion and such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion, the spin-off is determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off transaction is taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Vectrus in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received, thereby potentially increasing such holder\u2019s tax liability. Even if the Vectrus spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our shareholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of Vectrus are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Vectrus spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial.\nVectrus has agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the distribution to be taxable to Exelis, including under Section 355(e). Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off, Exelis and Vectrus have agreed to indemnify each other for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions to the extent a party\u2019s actions caused such tax liability, whether or not the indemnified party consented to such transaction or the indemnifying party was otherwise permitted to enter into such transaction under the Tax Matters Agreement. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Exelis consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including Vectrus and its subsidiaries) would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. Federal income tax liability if all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, and Vectrus would make certain payments to Exelis in respect of certain tax benefits that would be realized by us in connection with the spin-off under the Tax Matters Agreement if the spin-off were to be taxable. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company.\nIn connection with the Vectrus spin-off, Vectrus indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified Vectrus for certain liabilities. This indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by Vectrus and Vectrus may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nAs part of the Distribution Agreement, Exelis and Vectrus indemnified each other with respect to such parties\u2019 assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and breaches of the Distribution Agreement or related separation agreements. There can be no assurance that the indemnity from Vectrus will be sufficient to protect us\nPage |\nagainst the full amount of these and other liabilities, or that Vectrus will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Vectrus has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Vectrus any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, performance on indemnities that we provided Vectrus may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Vectrus spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Exelis did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or Vectrus shares to Exelis or providing Exelis with a claim for money damages against Vectrus in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Exelis and the fair market value of Vectrus at the time of the spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Exelis was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of Vectrus common stock.\nThe distribution by Exelis of the Vectrus common stock in the spin-off could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Indiana Business Corporation Law, a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the corporation\u2019s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. No assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution by Exelis of Vectrus common stock in the spin-off was unlawful.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nYou face the following risks in connection with ownership of our common stock:\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business; success or failure of our business strategy; our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry; our ability to obtain financing as needed; announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; investor perception of our Company and the defense industry; natural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us; overall market fluctuations; fluctuations in the budget of federal, state and local governmental entities around the world; results from any material litigation or government investigation; changes in laws and regulations affecting our business; and general economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nPage |\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend.\nAdditionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt-payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing our dividend. There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, the amended and restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated by-laws, among other things, provide for a classified board, which will be phased out in 2017, require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations and do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders. In addition, the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of an \u201cissuing public corporation.\u201d\nRisks Relating to our Separation from ITT Corporation\nWe face the following risks in connection with our spin-off from ITT Corporation (\"ITT\") in 2011:\nThe ITT spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe ITT spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the ITT spin-off left us, ITT and/or Xylem Inc. insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we, ITT and/or Xylem Inc. intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that ITT did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the ITT spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the ITT spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIf we are required to indemnify ITT or Xylem Inc. in connection with the ITT spin-off, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with ITT and Xylem Inc., ITT and Xylem Inc. agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ITT and Xylem Inc. for certain liabilities as discussed further in Note 17, \u201cRelated Party Transactions,\u201d and Note 18, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnities that we may be required to provide ITT and Xylem Inc. may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from ITT and Xylem Inc. will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ITT and Xylem Inc. will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPage |", "PERMNO": 13018, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "XLS"}
