RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors apply to the Company\u2019s business and operations. These risk factors are not exhaustive and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including matters addressed in the section above entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements and Risk.\u201d Altus may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company, or that Altus currently deems immaterial, which may also impair its business or financial condition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein.\nRisks Related to the Business of Altus Midstream\nThe Company\u2019s business activities and the value of its securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, Altus\u2019 business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of Altus\u2019 securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to Altus\u2019 securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities the Company may issue in the future.\nAltus derives a substantial portion of its revenue from Apache, and its plans for growth will heavily depend on Apache\u2019s growth in Alpine High. If Apache changes its business strategy in Alpine High, alters its current drilling and development plan on acreage dedicated to Altus, or otherwise significantly reduces the volumes of natural gas or NGLs with respect to which Altus performs midstream services, Altus\u2019 revenue would decline and its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nAll of the Company\u2019s current commercial agreements are with Apache, and, as a result, Altus derives substantially all of its revenue from Apache. Accordingly, Altus will be subject to the operational and business risks of Apache, the most significant of which include the following:\n\u2022\na further reduction in or slowing of Apache\u2019s drilling and development plans for or deferrals of production from the acreage dedicated to the Company, which would directly and adversely impact demand for Altus\u2019 midstream services;\n\u2022\nthe price, and the volatility of the price, of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could have a negative effect on Apache\u2019s drilling and development plans for the acreage dedicated to the Company or Apache\u2019s ability to finance its operations and drilling and completion costs relating to the acreage dedicated to Altus;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital on an economic basis to fund Apache\u2019s exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\ndrilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities, associated with Apache\u2019s operations on the acreage dedicated to the Company;\n\u2022\ndownstream processing and transportation capacity constraints and interruptions, including the failure of Apache to have sufficient contracted transportation capacity; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects of increased or changed governmental and environmental regulation or enforcement of existing regulation.\nIn addition, Altus will be indirectly subject to the business risks of Apache generally and other factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nApache\u2019s financial condition, credit ratings, leverage, market reputation, liquidity, and cash flows;\n\u2022\nApache\u2019s ability to maintain or replace its reserves;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation on Apache\u2019s upstream operations; and\n\u2022\nlosses, if any, from Apache\u2019s pending or future litigation.\nFurther, Altus does not have control over Apache\u2019s business decisions and operations, and Apache is under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that is favorable to the Company. For example, Apache may decide to allocate capital that Altus expects to be spent in Alpine High to other parts of its business. Thus, Altus will be subject to the risk of cancellation of planned development, nonperformance of commitments with respect to future dedications, and other nonpayment or nonperformance by Apache, including with respect to its commercial agreements, which do not contain minimum volume commitments. Furthermore, the Company cannot predict the extent to which Apache\u2019s businesses would be impacted if conditions in the energy industry were to deteriorate nor can Altus estimate the impact such conditions would have on Apache\u2019s ability to execute its drilling and development plan on the acreage dedicated to the Company or to perform under their commercial agreements. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by Apache under their commercial agreements would have a significant adverse impact on Altus\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe long-term commercial agreements between the Company and Apache have initial terms of approximately 14 years, through March 31, 2032, which may be extended by Apache for two five-year periods. There is no guarantee that Apache will extend these agreements beyond the initial terms or that Altus will be able to renew or replace these agreements on equal or better terms, or at all, upon their expiration. The Company\u2019s ability to renew or replace these commercial agreements following their expiration at rates sufficient to maintain the current revenues and cash flows of the Company could be adversely affected by activities beyond Altus\u2019 control, including the activities of its competitors and Apache.\nIn addition to Altus\u2019 commercial agreements with Apache, the Company may engage in significant business with new third-party customers or enter into material commercial contracts with customers with whom the Company does not have material commercial arrangements or commitments today and who may not have investment grade credit ratings. To the extent the Company derives substantial income from, or commits to capital projects to service, new or existing customers, each of the risks indicated above would apply to such arrangements and customers.\nBecause the Company has a limited operating history and have generated minimal revenues and operating cash flows, it may be difficult to evaluate its business and ability to successfully implement its business strategy.\nBecause of the Company\u2019s limited operating history, the operating performance of the Company\u2019s assets and business strategy are not yet proven. Construction of Altus\u2019 midstream assets began in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the Company has only generated minimal revenues and operating cash flows since such time. As a result, it may be difficult for you to evaluate the Company\u2019s business and results of operations to date and to assess its future prospects.\nIn addition, Altus may encounter risks and difficulties experienced by companies whose performance is dependent upon newly constructed assets, such as its assets failing to function as expected, higher than expected operating costs, equipment breakdown or failures, and operational errors. The Company may be less successful in achieving a consistent operating level capable of generating cash flows from its operations as compared to a company whose major assets have had longer operating histories. In addition, Altus may be less equipped to identify and address operating risks and hazards in the conduct of its business than those companies whose major assets have had longer operating histories.\nIf the Company seeks to acquire assets or businesses but are unable to do so on economically acceptable terms or are unable to successfully integrate any acquired assets or operations, its future growth will be limited.\nFrom time to time, the Company may evaluate and seek to acquire assets or businesses that it believes complement its existing business and related assets. The Company may acquire assets or businesses that it plans to use in a manner materially different from their prior owners\u2019 uses. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected volumes, revenues, profitability, or growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize any expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\nthe coordination of geographically disparate organizations, systems, and facilities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nAny assessment of these risks will be inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition. Realization of any of these risks could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If Altus consummates any future acquisition, its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly.\nAltus owns or operates a portion of its business with one or more equity interest partners or in circumstances where Altus is not the operator, which may restrict its operational and corporate flexibility; actions taken by other partners or third-party operators may materially impact its financial position and results of operations, and Altus may not realize the benefits it expects to realize from an equity interest.\nAs is common in the midstream industry, Altus owns or operates one or more of its properties with one or more equity interest partners or contracts with a third-party to control operations. These relationships require the Company to share operational and other control or to defer to another party\u2019s control, such that it does not have the flexibility to control the development of these properties. If Altus does not timely meet its financial commitments in such circumstances, its rights to participate may be adversely affected. If an equity interest partner is unable or fails to pay its portion of development costs or if a third-party operator does not operate in accordance with the Company\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s costs of operations could be increased. Altus could also incur liability as a result of actions taken by an equity interest partner or third-party operator. Disputes between Altus and the other party or parties in an equity interest may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase the Company\u2019s expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract the Company\u2019s officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on Altus\u2019 business.\nIf any of the Equity Method Interest Pipelines experience cost overruns or do not generate the cash flows Altus expects, the Company\u2019s plans for growth will be impaired.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy to grow its business depends in part on its equity interests in the Equity Method Interest Pipelines. Altus can offer no assurance that the Equity Method Interest Pipelines will perform as expected. The Company\u2019s equity interests pertain to pipelines that have recently commenced operations or are under construction. If applicable pipelines do not perform as expected, Altus may experience losses in relation to its equity interests.\nIn addition, each of the Equity Method Interest Pipelines is subject to risks associated with construction delays, cost over-runs, operational hazards, environmental matters, regulatory matters, and legal matters, as well as other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the operator of the pipeline. If any of these matters materially delay completion of an Equity Method Interest Pipeline, including the planned completion of construction for PHP, the holders of interests in such Equity Method Interest Pipeline may re-evaluate the economics and feasibility of completing the project, which may result in a decision to materially defer completion of the project or terminate or abandon the project entirely. If any of these risks were to materialize or if an Equity Method Interest Pipeline, including PHP, were to be terminated or abandoned, Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAltus is required to make significant capital contributions to the owners of the Equity Method Interest Pipelines for Altus\u2019 share of the capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company currently owns non-operating equity interests in the Equity Method Interest Pipelines. The Company is required to fund its share of any remaining capital expenditures required to complete construction of the applicable pipelines. Once a pipeline is operational, as a non-operating, minority owner, Altus will have limited or no control over decisions to make maintenance and capital expenditures on the pipeline. To the extent that the operator of one of the Equity Method Interest Pipelines decides to make additional capital expenditures for the pipeline, Altus could be required to contribute additional capital to maintain its ownership interest, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAltus does not have any employees and relies entirely on services provided by Apache\u2019s employees.\nThe Company does not have any employees. Instead, Altus relies entirely on Apache\u2019s employees to conduct the Company\u2019s business and activities pursuant to the COMA. Apache conducts businesses and activities of its own in which Altus does not have an economic interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to Altus and Apache. If Apache\u2019s employees who provide services to the Company do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of Altus\u2019 business and activities, Altus\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe COMA is subject to termination by Altus or Apache under certain circumstances, including if Apache and its affiliates no longer own a direct or indirect interest in at least 50 percent of the voting or other equity securities of the Company. Should the COMA be terminated by Altus or Apache, Altus will be required to attract and hire employees to perform the services currently performed by Apache\u2019s employees under the COMA or otherwise contract with third parties for the provision of such services, which, in either case, could subject Altus to substantial additional costs, could cause significant disruptions to Altus\u2019 business, may be on terms less favorable than the terms of the COMA, and, as a result, Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe services that the Company offers require laborers skilled in multiple disciplines, such as equipment operators, mechanics, and engineers, among others. In the event that the COMA is terminated and the Company is required to attract and hire employees, its business will be dependent on its ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skill sets to future needs, competition for skilled labor, or the unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges, such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Altus\u2019 costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to manage and operate its business. If the Company is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAltus\u2019 executive officers and directors may face potential conflicts of interest in managing the Company\u2019s business.\nAltus\u2019 executive officers and certain directors are also officers or employees of Apache. These relationships may create conflicts of interest regarding corporate opportunities and other matters. The resolution of any such conflicts may not always be in the Company\u2019s or its stockholders\u2019 best interests. In addition, these overlapping executive officers and directors allocate their time among Altus and Apache. These officers and directors face potential conflicts regarding the allocation of their time, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAll of Altus\u2019 gathering and processing operations are located in Alpine High, making it vulnerable to risks associated with having revenue-producing operations concentrated in one geographic area.\nAltus\u2019 revenue-producing operations are geographically concentrated in Alpine High of the Southern Delaware Basin of West Texas, causing the Company to be disproportionately exposed to risks associated with regional factors. The concentration of the Company\u2019s operations in this region increases its exposure to unexpected events that may occur in this region, such as natural disasters. Furthermore, the Company may be exposed to increases in costs as a result of regional economic conditions and availability of goods and services. For example, Altus is relying on temporary power sources until local utilities can install permanent power. If availability of permanent power from local service providers is delayed, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the Company relies on the availability of a skilled labor force, which could become more expensive (or at certain times, unavailable) if the labor market in the Permian Basin continues to tighten. Any one of these events has the potential to have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, and prevent development within originally anticipated time frames. Any of these risks could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAltus is dependent on the supply of natural gas and NGLs to its system, and any decrease in the supply of such commodities could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAltus currently generates substantially all of its revenues under agreements with Apache\u2019s upstream development located in Alpine High. None of these agreements contain minimum volume commitments, and, therefore, the Company\u2019s cash flows, other than cash flows from Equity Method Interest Pipelines, will depend upon the volumes Apache produces in Alpine High for so long as Apache is the Company\u2019s sole or most significant customer. Further, the Company may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas and NGL supplies. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase the volumes on its system by accessing new supplies to offset the natural decline in its customers\u2019 reserves, the Company\u2019s business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, the Company\u2019s future growth will depend in part upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in its current supplies.\nFluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by Apache and third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. Altus could see continued downward pressure on future drilling activity in Alpine High if commodity prices decline below current levels, which may result in lower throughput volumes. Tax policy changes or additional regulatory restrictions on development could also have a negative impact on drilling activity, reducing supplies of product available to the Company\u2019s system and assets. Altus has no control over Apache or other producers and depend on them to maintain sufficient levels of drilling activity. An ongoing decrease in the level of drilling activity or a material decrease in production in the Company\u2019s area of operation for a prolonged period, as a result of continued depressed commodity prices or otherwise, would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nAny decrease in the volumes that Altus gathers, processes, or transmits would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes of natural gas and NGLs gathered, processed, and transmitted on its assets. Decreases in the volumes of natural gas and NGLs that Altus gathers, processes, or transmits would directly and adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. These volumes can be influenced by factors beyond Altus\u2019 control, including:\n\u2022\nenvironmental or other governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nincreases in storage levels of natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nincreased use of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\ncontinued fluctuation in commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nsupply disruptions;\n\u2022\navailability of supply connected to the Company\u2019s systems; and\n\u2022\navailability and adequacy of infrastructure to gather and process supply into and out of the Company\u2019s systems.\nThe volumes of natural gas and NGLs gathered, processed, and transmitted on the Company\u2019s assets also depend on the production from the region that supplies its systems. Supply of natural gas and NGLs can be affected by many of the factors listed above, including commodity prices, the decision to recover or reject ethane from rich-gas processed through the Company\u2019s rich-gas processing facilities, and weather. In order to increase throughput levels on the Company\u2019s system, the Company must obtain new sources of natural gas and NGLs.\nThe primary factors affecting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain new sources of natural gas and NGLs include:\n\u2022Apache\u2019s drilling activity in Altus\u2019 area of operations;\n\u2022the level of successful leasing, permitting, and drilling activity in Altus\u2019 area of operation;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to compete for volumes from new wells; and\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully for volumes from sources connected to other pipelines.\nAltus has no control over the level of drilling activity in its area of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its system, or the rate at which production from a well declines. Furthermore, the Company does not have minimum volume commitments in its current commercial agreements with Apache that would otherwise generate a minimum amount of cash in the event that Apache\u2019s production in Alpine High declines or ceases. Likewise, the Company has no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, levels of reserves, availability of drilling rigs, and other costs of production and equipment.\nApache may suspend, reduce, or terminate its obligations under its commercial agreements with Altus in certain circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nAltus Midstream Gathering LP, Altus Midstream Processing LP, Altus Midstream NGL Pipeline LP, and Altus Midstream Pipeline LP are parties to a Gas Gathering Agreement, a Gas Processing Agreement, an NGL Transportation Services Agreement (TSA), and a Residue Gas TSA, respectively, with Apache. Each of these agreements includes provisions that permit Apache to\nsuspend, reduce, or terminate its obligations under the agreement if certain events occur. These events include force majeure events that would prevent the Company from performing some or all of the required services under the applicable agreement. Apache, as the counterparty under these commercial agreements, has the discretion to make such decisions, notwithstanding the fact that they may significantly and adversely affect the Company. Any such reduction, suspension, or termination of Apache\u2019s obligations under these agreements would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWhile Apache has granted Altus a right of first offer to provide additional midstream services and acquire Apache\u2019s retained midstream assets in Alpine High, Apache does not have to accept the Company\u2019s offer if a competitor provides more attractive economic terms.\nApache has granted Altus a right of first offer to provide additional midstream services and acquire Apache\u2019s retained midstream assets in Alpine High. Although Apache granted Altus this right of first offer, the Company can make no assurances that the economic terms that it offers Apache will be acceptable to Apache, and another midstream service provider or a third party may be willing to make an offer to Apache on economic terms that Altus is unwilling or unable to offer. Altus\u2019 inability to take advantage of the opportunities with respect to the right of first offer could adversely affect its growth strategy.\nA significant amount of the revenue currently generated by Altus is from contracts with Apache that contain most favored nations rights and other consent rights, limiting flexibility to offer certain capacity to new shippers.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s system\u2019s current available capacity is provided to Apache under the Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, the NGL TSA, and the Residue Gas TSA. The Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, and the NGL TSA contain most favored nations rights (MFNs) that could result in lower rates being charged to Apache in the event that any of the rates being charged to other customers are less than the similar rates charged to Apache. Triggering the MFNs in the Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, or the NGL TSA could lead to a reduction in revenue generated by the Company, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, all four of these agreements may require Apache\u2019s consent to offer third-party customers priority of service in the Company\u2019s facilities that is at least equal to Apache\u2019s priority of service. If Apache refuses to grant such consent, the Company\u2019s ability to attract third-party customers to its midstream facilities could be negatively impacted, thereby adversely impacting its ability to grow as expected.\nWithout Apache\u2019s consent, the MFNs effectively limit the Company\u2019s flexibility in negotiating rates for some of Altus\u2019 services with other shippers to fill excess system capacity, because triggering the MFNs contained in the Gas Gathering Agreement, the Gas Processing Agreement, or the NGL TSA would lead to a reduction in the rates that the Company charges to Apache, which would adversely affect Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTo maintain and grow its business, Altus is, and will be, required to make substantial capital expenditures.\nIn order to meet its contractual obligations under the Gas Gathering Agreement and the Gas Processing Agreement with Apache, Altus may have to make substantial capital investments based on Apache\u2019s forecasted development plans in order to maintain or expand the Company\u2019s existing facilities. Apache\u2019s plans are subject to change and there is no guarantee that facilities Altus builds or maintains will be utilized to provide services consistent with Apache\u2019s forecast, or at all. As a result, Altus could potentially incur material capital expenses that generate no return.\nIn order to maintain and grow its business, Altus will need to make substantial capital expenditures to fund growth capital expenditures as well as its share of capital expenditures associated with the Equity Method Interest Pipelines. If the Company does not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, it will be unable to maintain and grow its business, and, as a result, it may be unable to increase its cash flow over the long term. To fund Altus\u2019 capital expenditures, it will be required to use cash from its operations, incur debt, engage in structured financing transactions, or sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity securities. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain bank financing or its ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by its financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in its then-current debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions, contingencies, and uncertainties that are beyond its control. Also, due to Altus\u2019 relationship with Apache, Altus\u2019 ability to access the capital markets or the pricing or other terms of any capital markets transactions may be adversely affected by any impairment to the financial condition of Apache or adverse changes in Apache\u2019s credit ratings. Any material limitation on Altus\u2019 ability to access capital as a result of such adverse changes to Apache could limit Altus\u2019 ability to obtain future financing under favorable terms, or at all, or could result in increased financing costs in the future. Similarly, material adverse changes affecting Apache could negatively impact the Company\u2019s share price, limiting its ability to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financing, could negatively affect its ability to engage in, expand, or pursue its business activities, or could also prevent it from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to the Company.\nAdditionally, the capital and global credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption in the past. In many cases during these periods, the capital markets have exerted downward pressure on equity values and reduced the credit capacity for certain companies. Altus\u2019 ability to grow is dependent, in part, upon its ability to access capital at rates and on terms it determines to be attractive. Similar or more severe levels of global market disruption and volatility may have an adverse effect on Altus or Apache resulting from, but not limited to, disruption of Altus\u2019 or Apache\u2019s access to capital and credit markets, difficulty in obtaining financing necessary to expand facilities or acquire assets, increased financing costs, and increasingly restrictive covenants. If Altus or Apache are unable to access capital at competitive rates, the Company\u2019s strategy of enhancing the earnings potential of its existing assets, including through capital-growth projects and acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses, may be affected adversely. A number of factors could affect adversely Altus\u2019 ability to access capital, including:\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022capital market conditions;\n\u2022market prices for natural gas, NGLs, and other hydrocarbons;\n\u2022the overall health of the energy and related industries;\n\u2022share price; and\n\u2022capital structure.\nIf the Company\u2019s ability to access capital becomes constrained significantly, its interest costs and cost of equity will likely increase and could affect adversely its financial condition and future results of operations.\nEven if Altus is successful in obtaining any necessary funds to support its growth, the terms of such financings could limit Altus\u2019 ability to institute a dividend to its stockholders in the future. In addition, incurring debt will cause Altus to incur interest expense and increase its financial leverage, and issuing additional shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity interests may result in significant stockholder dilution, which could materially decrease the Company\u2019s ability to institute a dividend to its stockholders in the future. While the Company historically received funding from Apache, none of Apache nor any of its affiliates is committed to providing any direct or indirect financial support to fund Altus\u2019 growth.\nConstruction or maintenance of Altus\u2019 assets subjects it to risks of construction delays, cost over-runs, limitations on its growth, and negative effects on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe construction and maintenance of Altus\u2019 assets is complex and subject to a number of factors beyond its control, including delays from third-party landowners, the permitting process, complying with laws, unavailability or increased cost of materials, labor disruptions, labor availability, environmental hazards, financing, accidents, weather, and other factors. Any delay in the completion or continued maintenance of the assets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The construction and maintenance of pipelines and gathering and processing facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed the Company\u2019s estimated costs. Estimating the timing and expenditures related to these projects is very complex and subject to variables that can significantly increase expected costs. Should the actual costs of these projects exceed the Company\u2019s estimates, its liquidity and capital position could be adversely affected.\nAltus relies exclusively on Apache to provide certain services related to the design, development, construction, operation, management, and maintenance of its midstream assets on the Company\u2019s behalf pursuant to the COMA. Although the COMA provides for certain fixed annual limits on the support services fee payable to Apache through 2022, there is no limit on such fees thereafter. As a result, after 2022, Altus may be required to pay Apache higher fees than would be available from third parties. The COMA is subject to termination by Altus or Apache under certain circumstances, including if Apache and its affiliates no longer own a direct or indirect interest in at least 50 percent of the voting or other equity securities of the Company. Should the COMA be terminated by Altus or Apache, the Company may be forced to contract for services previously provided under the COMA, which may be disruptive to its operations and may be on terms less favorable than the terms of the COMA, and, as a result, its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Additionally, the COMA provides Apache with broad discretion to enter into contracts on Altus\u2019 behalf.\nConstruction of new assets may be more expensive than anticipated, may not result in revenue increases, and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal, and economic risks that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to or the maintenance of the Company\u2019s existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets (including the Equity Method Interest Pipelines) involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties beyond Altus\u2019 control, including potential protests, tariffs on materials used in construction or operations (including steel used to construct pipelines), or legal actions by interested third parties, and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If the Company undertakes these projects, it may not be able to complete them on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, the Company\u2019s earnings may not increase due to the successful construction of a particular project. For instance, if the Company expands a pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and the Company may not receive any material increases in revenues promptly following completion of a project or at all. Moreover, the Company may construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in an area in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve Altus\u2019 expected investment return, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the construction of additions to the Company\u2019s existing gathering and processing assets, as may be required, for example, to service new customers, will generally require Altus to obtain new rights-of-way and permits prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities. The Company may be unable to timely obtain such rights-of-way or permits to connect new product supplies to its existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for the Company to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Altus\u2019 cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAltus may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.\nPerformance of the Company\u2019s operations require that it obtain and maintain a number of federal, state, and local permits, licenses, and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits, and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping, and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit, or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of the Company\u2019s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility or the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAdditionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, the Company may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies, and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.\nAltus does not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves and relies on evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves obtained by its customers; therefore, volumes that Altus services in the future could be less than anticipated.\nThe Company does not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves connected to its gathering systems or that it otherwise services, and the Company relies on reserves reports if and when provided by its customers. Accordingly, the Company does not have independent estimates of total reserves serviced by its assets or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of these reserves is less than the Company anticipates, in reliance on its customers\u2019 reports, and the Company is unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes transmitted on the Company\u2019s gathering systems or that it otherwise services in the future could be less than anticipated. A decline in such volumes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDebt Altus incurs may limit its flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.\nIn November 2018, Altus Midstream entered into a credit agreement, which, as amended, provides for a five-year revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, with aggregate commitments of $800 million. Altus Midstream may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. The Company\u2019s future level of debt could have important consequences to it, including the following:\n\u2022\nits ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures (including building additional gathering and processing assets or funding its share of capital expenditures associated with the Equity Method Interest Pipelines), or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nits funds available for operations, future business opportunities, and dividends to its stockholders in the future, if any, will be reduced by that portion of its cash flows required to make interest payments on its debt;\n\u2022\nit may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nits flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nAltus\u2019 ability to service any debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory, and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If the Company\u2019s operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness, it will be forced to take actions such as not instituting a dividend (or reducing or eliminating a dividend, if already instituted), reducing or delaying its business activities, investments, or capital expenditures, selling assets, or issuing equity. Altus may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to commodity price risk may change over time.\nThe Company currently generates essentially all of its revenues pursuant to fee-based contracts under which the Company is paid based on the volumes that it gathers, processes, and transmits, rather than the underlying value of the commodity, and only has an immaterial portion of its revenues that are based on the underlying value of a commodity. However, Altus may enter into contracts or may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in a manner that increases its exposure to commodity price risk. Future exposure to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices could adversely affect Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR, and the adoption of an alternative reference rate, may have a material adverse impact on Altus Midstream\u2019s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs.\nPursuant to the terms of Altus Midstream\u2019s revolving credit facility, Altus Midstream may elect to use London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings under its revolving credit facility. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to LIBOR) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely-accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Although the full impact of the transition away from LIBOR, including the discontinuance of LIBOR publication and the adoption of SOFR as the replacement rate for LIBOR, remains unclear, these changes may have an adverse impact on Altus Midstream\u2019s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under its revolving credit facility.\nIf third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to the Company\u2019s gathering, processing, or transmission systems become partially or fully unavailable or if the volumes Altus gathers, processes, or transmits do not meet the quality requirements of the pipelines or facilities to which Altus connects, its cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s gathering, processing, and transmission assets connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The Company\u2019s continuing access to such third-party pipelines, processing facilities, and other midstream facilities are not within the Company\u2019s control. These pipelines, plants, and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements, and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues. In addition, if the Company\u2019s costs to access and transmit on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, its profitability could be reduced. If any such increase in costs occurs, if any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unable to receive, transmit, or process product, or if the volumes the Company gathers or transmits do not meet the product quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, Altus\u2019 cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAltus\u2019 industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAltus competes with similar enterprises in its industry. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. The Company\u2019s competitors include large midstream companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs than the Company. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transmission, and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services the Company provides to its customers. In addition, potential customers may develop their own gathering systems instead of using the Company\u2019s systems. Excess pipeline capacity in the region served by the Company\u2019s intrastate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact its ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. The Company\u2019s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain or increase current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal, liquid fuels, and sources of alternative energy. Increased demand for such other forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission services. Although Altus does not have employees, Apache\u2019s employees perform work for Altus pursuant to the COMA, and Apache still competes with larger midstream companies in attracting and retaining personnel, including equipment operators, mechanics, engineers, and other specialists. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by the Company\u2019s systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs, and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.\nAltus\u2019 ability to institute a dividend will depend on its ability to generate sufficient cash flow, which it may not be able to accomplish.\nAltus may not generate sufficient cash flow to enable it to institute a dividend in the future. Its ability to institute a dividend will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the volumes of natural gas and NGLs it gathers and processes, commodity prices, including for crude oil, and other factors impacting Altus\u2019 financial condition, some of which are beyond its control. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on Altus\u2019 capital stock may only be paid from \u201csurplus,\u201d which is the amount by which the fair value of Altus\u2019 total assets exceeds the sum of its total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of its capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from Altus\u2019 net profits for the then-current and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nAltus may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would reduce Altus\u2019 revenues and limit its future profitability.\nThe renewal or replacement of the Company\u2019s existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain or increase current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including competition from other midstream service providers and the price of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs in the markets Altus serves. The inability of the Company to renew or replace its current or future contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on its profitability.\nAltus is exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties, including Apache, and the nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers or counterparties could have an adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers or other counterparties, including Apache. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties could adversely affect Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, equity values for the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties may be low. The combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from lower commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the liquidity of the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties and their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to the Company. Furthermore, some of the Company\u2019s customers or other counterparties may be leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the Company.\nIn the event Apache elects to sell acreage that is dedicated to Altus to a third party, the third party\u2019s financial condition could be materially worse than Apache\u2019s, and Altus could be subject to the nonpayment or nonperformance by the third party.\nIn the event Apache elects to sell acreage that is dedicated to the Company to a third party, the third party\u2019s financial condition could be materially worse than Apache\u2019s. In such a case, the Company may be subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by the third party, which risks may increase during periods of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, the third party may be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the Company. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by the third party could adversely impact the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company.\nAltus is subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies, which could adversely impact its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by multiple federal, state, and local governmental agencies. Proposals and proceedings that affect the midstream industry are regularly considered by Congress, as well as by state legislatures and federal and state regulatory commissions, agencies, and courts. The Company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on its business. However, additions to the regulatory burden on the midstream industry can increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business and affect its profitability.\nIncreased federal, state, and local legislation and regulatory initiatives, as well as government reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and reductions or delays in crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production by Altus\u2019 customers, including Apache, which could adversely affect Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production is developed from unconventional sources, such as deep oil or gas shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. State legislatures and agencies and other political subdivisions have enacted legislation and promulgated rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing, require disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals, temporarily or permanently ban hydraulic fracturing, and impose additional permit requirements and operational restrictions in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. The EPA and BLM have also issued rules, conducted studies, and made proposals that, if implemented, could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation. For instance, the EPA has issued final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and adopted rules prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM also adopted new rules, effective on January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. However, the status of recent and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the current presidential administration is uncertain. For example, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain provisions of the performance standards, but elected not to finalize the stay, and instead, in February 2018, finalized amendments to some of the requirements. In addition, in December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended some of the new venting and flaring requirements, only to have a court subsequently enjoin the suspension.\nState and federal regulatory agencies also have recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in induced seismicity, which has resulted in some regulation at the state level. As regulatory agencies continue to study induced seismicity, additional legislative and regulatory initiatives could affect the injection well operations of the Company\u2019s customers as well.\nThe Company cannot predict whether any additional legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if so, what the provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state, or local level, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs, and process prohibitions for the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers that could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs that move through the Company\u2019s gathering systems, which could materially adversely affect its revenue and results of operations.\nNegative public perception regarding Altus and/or its industry could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nNegative public perception regarding Altus and/or its industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits Altus requires to conduct its operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict its ability to profitably conduct its business.\nAltus may face opposition to the construction or operation of its pipelines and facilities from various groups.\nAltus may face opposition to the construction or operation of its pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage the Company\u2019s construction activities or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving Altus\u2019 assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the construction or operation of Altus\u2019 assets and business. For example, repairing the Company\u2019s pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist the Company\u2019s efforts to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or facility for a period of time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. In addition, acts of sabotage or terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of Altus\u2019 operations. Any such event that delays or interrupts the construction of assets or revenues generated by the Company\u2019s existing operations, or which causes it to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could affect adversely its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the Company\u2019s share price.\nIf Altus\u2019 assets (including assets acquired in the future, if any) become subject to FERC regulation or federal, state, or local regulations or policies change, Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of the Company\u2019s facilities, the Company\u2019s gathering facilities meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the classification and regulation of the Company\u2019s gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, then the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and the rules and regulations promulgated under that statute. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas gathering and transportation facilities are largely regulated by the RRC, and, to the extent that its intrastate natural gas transportation systems transport natural gas in interstate commerce, the rates and terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311 of the NGPA, rates charged for interstate transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate facility\u2019s statement of operating conditions for transportation service under Section 311 of the NGPA are also subject to FERC review and approval. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than Altus\u2019 currently-approved rates under Section 311 of the NGPA, Altus\u2019 business may be adversely affected. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA, failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for service under Section 311 of the NGPA, and failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline\u2019s FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in an alteration of jurisdictional status and/or the imposition of administrative, civil, and criminal remedies. The Company\u2019s natural gas transportation facilities and operations are also subject to the Texas Utilities Code and the Texas Natural Resources Code, as implemented by the RRC. Generally, the RRC is vested with authority to ensure that rates, operations, and services of gas utilities, including intrastate pipelines, are just and reasonable and not discriminatory. The rates the Company charges for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law unless challenged in a customer or RRC complaint. The Company cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against it or whether the RRC will change its regulation of these rates. Failure to comply with the Texas Utilities Code or the Texas Natural Resources Code can result in the imposition of administrative, civil, and criminal remedies.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas pipeline system is also subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes in Texas. The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.\nThe Company\u2019s NGL pipeline facilities do not provide interstate transportation service and are therefore not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction under Interstate Commerce Act (ICA). Whether an NGL shipment is in interstate commerce under the ICA depends on the fixed and persistent intent of the shipper as to the NGLs\u2019 final destination, absent a break in the interstate movement. The Company\u2019s NGL pipelines meet the traditional tests FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is not providing transportation service in interstate commerce subject to FERC ICA jurisdiction. However, the determination of the interstate or intrastate character of shipments on the Company\u2019s NGL pipelines depends on the shipper\u2019s intentions and the transportation of the NGLs outside of the Company\u2019s system and may change over time. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and the character of an NGL shipment and determine that the shipment is in interstate commerce, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, transportation services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA. Such FERC regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending on the facility in question, adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company fails to comply with applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations, and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the EPAct), for instance, FERC has civil penalty authority to impose penalties for current violations of the NGA or NGPA of up to $1,213,503 per day for each violation. The maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. FERC also has the power to order disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and the EPAct. In addition, if any of the Company\u2019s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the ICA, this could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nAltus may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety regulations.\nThe pipelines the Company owns and operates are subject to stringent and complex regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity management, such as regulation by the DOT, through PHMSA, pursuant to the NGSPA, with respect to natural gas, and the HLSPA, with respect to NGLs. For instance, the DOT, through the PHMSA, has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for hazardous liquid (including oil) pipeline segments that, in the event of a leak or rupture, could affect high-consequence areas. In addition, on January 13, 2017, PHMSA issued a pre-publication final rule that included new hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations extending certain regulatory reporting requirements to all hazardous liquid gathering (including oil) pipelines. The final rule required additional event-driven and periodic inspections, required the use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modified repair criteria, and required certain pipelines to eventually accommodate in-line inspection tools. However, on January 24, 2017, PHMSA withdrew the final rule for further review in compliance with a regulatory freeze implemented by the Trump Administration on January 20, 2017. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nSeveral states have also passed legislation or promulgated rules to address pipeline safety. Recently, the RRC adopted rules that require operators of natural gas and hazardous liquid gathering lines in rural areas to report accidents, conduct investigations, and perform necessary corrective action. Compliance with pipeline integrity laws and other pipeline safety regulations issued by state agencies such as the RRC could result in substantial expenditures for testing, repairs, and replacement. If the Company\u2019s pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the RRC or the DOT regulations, then the Company may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines or operate the pipelines at a reduced maximum allowable operating pressure, the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time.\nDue to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position. Because certain of the Company\u2019s operations are located around areas that may become more populated areas, such as Alpine High, the Company may incur expenses to mitigate noise, odor, and light that may be emitted in its operations and expenses related to the appearance of its facilities. Municipal and other local or state regulations are imposing various obligations including, among other things, regulating the location of the Company\u2019s facilities, imposing limitations on the noise levels of its facilities and requiring certain other improvements that increase the cost of its facilities. The Company is also subject to claims by neighboring landowners for nuisance related to the construction and operation of its facilities, which could subject it to damages for declines in neighboring property values due to the Company\u2019s construction and operation of facilities.\nFailure to comply with existing or new environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or wastes into the environment may cause Altus to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nMany of the operations and activities of the Company\u2019s pipelines, gathering systems, processing plants, and other facilities are subject to significant federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which can result in administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions, or both. The obligations imposed by these laws and regulations include obligations related to air emissions and the discharge of pollutants from the Company\u2019s pipelines and other facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances and other wastes that are or may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by Altus or locations to which Altus has sent wastes for treatment or disposal. These laws may impose strict, joint, and several liability for the remediation of contaminated areas. Private parties, including the owners of properties near the Company\u2019s facilities or upon or through which its systems traverse, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance and to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws for releases of contaminants or for personal injury or property damage.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, legislation relating to the control of greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing environmental laws or regulations might adversely affect the Company\u2019s products and activities, including processing, storage, and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. Federal and state agencies could also impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect the Company\u2019s profitability. Changes in laws or regulations could also limit the operation of the Company\u2019s assets or adversely affect its ability to comply with applicable legal requirements or the demand for crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs, which could adversely affect its business and its profitability.\nRecent rules under the CAA imposing more stringent requirements on the oil and gas industry could cause Altus and its customers to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs as well as reduce the demand for Altus\u2019 services.\nAltus is subject to stringent and complex regulation under the CAA, implementing regulations, and state and local equivalents, including regulations related to controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines, and processing operations.\nAdditional regulation of GHG emissions from the oil and gas industry remains a possibility. These regulations could require a number of modifications to the Company\u2019s operations, and its natural gas exploration and production suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 operations, including the installation of new equipment, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The incurrence of such expenditures and costs by the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers could result in reduced production by those suppliers and customers and thus translate into reduced demand for Altus\u2019 services.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas and NGLs services the Company provides.\nCongress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.\nThe EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that emit GHGs. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. These EPA rule makings could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and restrict or delay the Company\u2019s ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore crude oil and natural gas production sources in the U.S. on an annual basis.\nIn addition, many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and NGLs fractionation plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict whether future legislation or new regulations may be adopted to address GHG emissions or how such measures would impact the Company\u2019s business, the adoption of legislation or regulations imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, Altus\u2019 equipment and operations could require the Company to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations, could adversely affect its performance of operations in the absence of any permits that may be required to regulate emission of GHGs, or could adversely affect demand for the natural gas the Company gathers, processes, or otherwise handles in connection with its services.\nThe ESA and the MBTA govern Altus\u2019 operations and additional restrictions may be imposed in the future, which could have an adverse impact on its operations.\nThe ESA and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the MBTA. FWS and state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species, which could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state, and private lands.\nAltus\u2019 business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect Altus\u2019 operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering, compressing, processing, and transmission of natural gas and NGLs, including:\n\u2022\ndamage to pipelines, related equipment, and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural or anthropogenic disasters, acts of terrorism, and cyberattacks;\n\u2022\nleaks of natural gas, NGLs, and other hydrocarbons;\n\u2022\ninduced seismicity; and\n\u2022\nfires and explosions.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of the Company\u2019s related operations. The Company is not fully insured against all risks incident to its business. In accordance with typical industry practice, Altus has appropriate levels of business interruption and property insurance. The Company is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect Altus\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAltus does not own in fee any of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to its operations.\nThe Company does not own in fee any of the land on which its midstream assets have been constructed. Altus\u2019 only interests in these properties are rights granted under surface use agreements, rights-of-way, surface leases, or other easement rights (collectively, Rights-of-Way), which may limit or restrict Altus\u2019 rights or access to or use of the surface estates. Accommodating these competing rights of the surface owners may adversely affect the operations of the Company. Apache and certain of its affiliates are party to certain of these Rights-of-Way. Furthermore, many of the Rights-of-Way on which the Company\u2019s assets have been constructed are not perpetual in duration and, upon the expiration of their terms, will require Altus to pay a renewal fee to the applicable surface owners in order to maintain access to such Rights-of-Way. These Rights-of-Way also require compliance with certain terms and conditions in order to renew their terms, some of which may be outside of Altus\u2019 control.\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use if Altus does not have valid Rights-of-Way or if such usage rights lapse or terminate. The Company may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. The loss of these rights, through the inability to renew Rights-of-Way or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company.\nA failure in Altus\u2019 computer systems or a terrorist or cyberattack on Altus or third parties with whom Altus does business may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nThe Company is reliant on technology to conduct its business. The Company\u2019s business is dependent upon its operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of its business, including operating its pipelines and gathering and processing facilities, recording and reporting commercial and financial transactions, and receiving and making payments. Any failure of the Company\u2019s computer systems or those of its customers, suppliers, or others with whom it does business, including Apache, could materially disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nUnknown entities or groups have mounted so-called \u201ccyberattacks\u201d on businesses to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations, and steal funds or data. Cyberattacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and critical business functions. In addition, the Company\u2019s pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist or environmental activist group activities that could disrupt Altus\u2019 ability to conduct its business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nStrategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks, environmental activist group activities, or cyberattacks than other targets in the United States. While the Company\u2019s insurance may not protect it against such occurrences, certain of Altus\u2019 insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events. The proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or its customers, suppliers, or others with whom it does business could have a material adverse effect on its business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage its reputation.\nMoreover, as the sophistication of cyberattacks continues to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance its digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities. In addition, cyberattacks against Altus or others in its industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact to its business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.\nIf Altus fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to report accurately its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential holders of the Company\u2019s equity could lose confidence in its financial reporting, which would harm its business and cost of capital.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for Altus to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. The Company cannot be certain that its efforts to maintain its internal controls will be successful, that it will be able to maintain adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future or that it will be able to continue to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving the Company\u2019s internal controls, could harm its operating results or cause it to fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of its equity interests.\nAltus may become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which would limit its business operations and require it to spend significant resources to comply with such act.\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act) defines an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40 percent of the issuer\u2019s unconsolidated assets, excluding cash items and securities issued by the federal government. It is possible that some or all of the interests in the Equity Method Interest Pipelines may be investment securities and that the value of those interests that are investment securities over time may exceed 40 percent of the applicable subsidiaries\u2019 unconsolidated assets, excluding cash and government securities, in which case such subsidiaries may meet this threshold definition of an investment company.\nThe Investment Company Act provides certain exclusions from this definition. However, if a subsidiary relies on any one or more of these exclusions from the definition of an investment company and such reliance is not correct, then the subsidiary may be in violation of the Investment Company Act, the consequences of which can be significant. For example, investment companies that fail to register under the Investment Company Act are prohibited from conducting business in interstate commerce, which includes selling securities or entering into other contracts in interstate commerce. Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act provides that a contract made in, or whose performance involves a, violation of the Investment Company Act is unenforceable by either party unless a court finds that enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement. Similarly, a court may not deny rescission to any party seeking to rescind a contract that violates the Investment Company Act, unless the court finds that denial of rescission would produce a more equitable result than granting rescission.\nIf in the future the nature of any of Altus\u2019 subsidiaries\u2019 businesses change such that no exception to the threshold definition of investment company is available to such subsidiary, then such subsidiary may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act provides that inadvertent or transient investment companies will not be treated as investment companies subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, provided the issuer has the requisite intent to be engaged in a non-investment business, evidenced by the issuer\u2019s business activities and an appropriate resolution of the issuer\u2019s board of directors, within one year from the commencement of the earlier of (1) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50 percent of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (2) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities (as defined in section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act) having a value exceeding 40 percent of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. If any of Altus\u2019 subsidiaries becomes an inadvertent investment company and fails to meet the requirements of the transient investment company exemption under Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act, then such subsidiary may be required to register as an investment company with the SEC.\nThe ramifications of becoming an investment company, both in terms of the restrictions it would have on such subsidiary and the cost of compliance, would be significant. For example, in addition to expenses related to initially registering as an investment company, the Investment Company Act also would impose various restrictions with regard to the subsidiary\u2019s ability to enter into affiliated transactions, the diversification of its assets, and its ability to borrow money. If any of Altus\u2019 subsidiaries became subject to the Investment Company Act at some point in the future, then the subsidiary\u2019s ability to continue pursuing its business plan would be severely limited.\nApache owns a majority of Altus\u2019 outstanding voting shares and thus strongly influences all of Altus\u2019 corporate actions.\nApache or an affiliate beneficially owns approximately 79 percent of Altus\u2019 outstanding voting common stock. As long as Apache or an affiliate owns or controls a significant percentage of Altus\u2019 outstanding voting power, it will have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of Altus\u2019 board of directors, any amendment of Altus\u2019 Charter or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of Altus\u2019 assets, and will be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of Altus\u2019 board of directors or a change in control of the Company that could deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company. In addition, under the Stockholders Agreement, Kayne Anderson Sponsor, LLC (Kayne Anderson Sponsor) is entitled to have two directors on the board of directors of the Company until the earlier of the time that Kayne Anderson Sponsor and its affiliates own less than 1 percent of the outstanding voting common stock of the Company or the second anniversary of the date of the Stockholders Agreement. Additionally, Apache is entitled to nominate up to seven directors to Altus\u2019 board of directors depending on its and its affiliates\u2019 ownership of Altus\u2019 outstanding voting common stock. In connection with the Stockholders Agreement, Apache and Kayne Anderson Sponsor have agreed to vote for the directors nominated by the other. The interests of Apache may not align with the interests of Altus\u2019 other stockholders.\nAltus is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nApache or an affiliate controls a majority, approximately 79 percent, of Altus\u2019 outstanding voting common stock. As a result, Altus is a controlled company within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under the Nasdaq listing rules, a company of which more than 50 percent of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe nominating and governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nThese requirements will not apply to Altus as long as it remains a controlled company, and Altus currently utilizes and intends to continue to utilize some, if not all, of these exemptions. Accordingly, Altus\u2019 stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq.\nAltus\u2019 only significant assets are ownership of the non-economic general partner interest and an approximate 23.1 percent limited partner interest in Altus Midstream LP, and such ownership may not be sufficient for Altus Midstream LP to make distributions or loans to Altus to enable it to pay any dividends on its Class A Common Stock or satisfy its other financial obligations.\nAltus has no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of the non-economic general partner interest and an approximate 23.1 percent limited partner interest in Altus Midstream LP. The Company depends on Altus Midstream LP for distributions, loans, and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations or to pay any dividends with respect to its Class A Common Stock. Subject to certain restrictions, Altus Midstream LP generally will be required to (i) make pro rata distributions to its partners, including the Company, on a quarterly basis in an amount at least sufficient to allow the Company to pay the Company\u2019s taxes and make tax advances to Altus Midstream LP\u2019s limited partners, other than the Company, in certain circumstances, and (ii) reimburse the Company for certain corporate and other overhead expenses. However, legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of Altus Midstream LP, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Altus Midstream LP, may limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain cash from Altus Midstream LP. In addition, Altus Midstream LP is required to pay specified quarterly distributions on its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units before paying distributions on Common Units. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Altus Midstream LP may not be sufficient to make distributions or loans to the Company to enable it to pay any dividends on its Class A Common Stock or satisfy its other financial obligations. The Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act generally restricts distributions to the extent that the liabilities of the limited partnership exceed the fair value of its assets.\nAltus may be required to take write-downs, write-offs, or restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and stock price, which could cause Altus\u2019 stockholders to lose some or all of their investment.\nAlthough Altus will conduct due diligence on acquisitions that it may make from time to time, it cannot assure its stockholders that this diligence will reveal all material issues that may be present in the businesses that it acquires, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of its control will not later arise. As a result, Altus may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if its due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise, and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the Company\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, the fact that it reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause Altus to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThere is no guarantee that Altus\u2019 warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and, as such, they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for Altus\u2019 warrants is $11.50 per share of Class A Common Stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and, as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nAlthough Altus has registered the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act, such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nAlthough Altus has registered the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act, it may not be able to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Altus cannot assure holders that it will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in such registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct, or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, Altus will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.\nHowever, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and Altus will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption is available.\nNotwithstanding the above, if Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, Altus may, at its option, require holders of warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, and, in the event Altus so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but it will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will Altus be required to net cash settle any warrant or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that it is unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant, and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. If and when the warrants become redeemable by Altus, it may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of Class A Common Stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nAltus may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your public warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened, and the number of shares of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a public warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nAltus\u2019 public warrants were issued in connection with its initial public offering in registered form under a warrant agreement between American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and Altus. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, Altus may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although Altus\u2019 ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50 percent of the then-outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the public warrants, shorten the exercise period, or decrease the number of shares of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a public warrant.\nAltus may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nAltus has the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of its Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date Altus sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by Altus, it may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nRedemption of the outstanding warrants could force the warrant holders to:\n\u2022\nexercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so;\n\u2022\nsell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants; or\n\u2022\naccept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their warrants.\nNone of the private placement warrants issued to Kayne Anderson Sponsor and Apache in connection with the Business Combination will be redeemable by Altus so long as they are held by Kayne Anderson Sponsor or its permitted transferees, with respect to Kayne Anderson Sponsor warrants, or Apache or its permitted transferees, with respect to the Apache warrants.\nThe Warrants are exercisable for Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock, which will, upon exercise, increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to Altus\u2019 stockholders.\nAltus has outstanding public warrants to purchase 12,577,350 shares of Class A Common Stock and private placement warrants to purchase 6,364,281 shares of Class A Common Stock. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock.\nIn the future, Apache may receive earn-out consideration of up to 37,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock upon the achievement of certain stock price and operational goals, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to Altus\u2019 stockholders.\nPursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Apache will have the right to receive earn-out consideration of up to 37,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock if certain stock price and operational goals are achieved. To the extent such stock price or operational goals are achieved and Apache becomes entitled to receive a portion or all of the earn-out consideration, additional shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. The shares of Class A Common Stock issuable to Apache as earn-out consideration have been registered for resale with the SEC. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares by Apache in the public market could adversely affect the market price of Class A Common Stock.\nHolders of Altus Midstream\u2019s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units have rights, preferences, and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of Common Units, and could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the holders of Common Units.\nIn June 2019, Altus Midstream issued and sold 625,000 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the Preferred Units) in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation.\nAltus Midstream is required to pay specified quarterly distributions on the Preferred Units before paying distributions on its Common Units. If Altus Midstream fails to pay the Preferred Unit distribution in respect of any quarter in full in cash (or in-kind for the first six quarters after the Preferred Units are issued), then Altus Midstream will not be permitted to declare or make any distributions on its Common Units until all accrued and accumulated but unpaid Preferred Unit distributions have been paid in full. In addition, Altus Midstream\u2019s cash payment of distributions on, and for redemption of, its Common Units is limited in amount and subject to satisfaction of leverage ratios.\nThe Preferred Units are redeemable at any time at the option of Altus Midstream and under certain circumstances, the Preferred Units are redeemable at the holders\u2019 option, in each case, at a price which incorporates an agreed return on the holders\u2019 investment. The Preferred Units also rank senior to the Common Units in right of liquidation, and holders of Preferred Units will be entitled to receive a liquidation preference that incorporates an agreed return on the holders\u2019 investment.\nThe Preferred Units may be exchanged for shares of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock at a discount under certain circumstances, which could be dilutive to existing holders of its Class A Common Stock. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued in any exchange would be based on its then-current trading price. Accordingly, the lower the trading price of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock at the time of any exchange, the greater the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that would be issued upon exchange of the Preferred Units, increasing potential dilution to existing holders of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock. Further, if the former holders of Preferred Units dispose of a substantial portion of their newly-exchanged Class A Common Stock in the public market, particularly over a short time period, it could adversely affect the market price for Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock and possibly make it more difficult for Altus to issue additional Class A Common Stock in the future at an attractive price.\nThe Company depends on Altus Midstream for distributions, loans, and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet the Company\u2019s financial obligations or to pay any dividends with respect to its Class A Common Stock. Obligations of Altus Midstream in respect of the Preferred Units may restrict, reduce, or render unavailable funds that otherwise may be available to be distributed, loaned, or paid to the Company by Altus Midstream or loaned to, or invested in, Altus Midstream by third parties. Altus Midstream\u2019s inability to make distributions, loans, and other payments to the Company may impact its ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends with respect to its Class A Common Stock, and the Company\u2019s inability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on reasonable terms or at all may limit its ability to pursue additional business opportunities.\nFor additional information regarding the Preferred Units, refer to Note 12-Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units within Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA significant portion of Altus\u2019 total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of its Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if its business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock. Additionally, effective May 8, 2019, Apache has the ability to redeem or exchange its 250,000,000 Common Units for shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustments, and the Company has the ability to settle such redemption in cash. The shares of Class A Common Stock issuable to Apache upon redemption or exchange of Altus Midstream Common Units have been registered for resale with the SEC. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares by Apache in the public market could adversely affect the market price of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock.\nIf the Business Combination benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders, or financial analysts, the market price of Altus\u2019 securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of Altus\u2019 securities may decline from the prevailing level prior to the closing of the Business Combination.\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of a stockholder\u2019s investment. Prior to the Business Combination, there was not a public market for equity securities of the Company and the assets it now operates, and trading in the shares of its Class A Common Stock was not active. If an active market for the Company\u2019s securities develops and continues, the trading price of its securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on a stockholder\u2019s investment in the Company\u2019s securities, and its securities may trade at prices significantly below the price paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to it;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about Altus\u2019 operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nAltus\u2019 operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting Altus\u2019 business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges in the Company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nsales and issuances of additional equity securities in the future to fund Altus\u2019 capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in Altus\u2019 board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of Class A Common Stock by the Company\u2019s directors, executive officers, or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Company\u2019s securities irrespective of Altus\u2019 operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of the Company\u2019s securities may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress the Company\u2019s stock price regardless of its business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of Altus\u2019 securities also could adversely affect its ability to issue additional securities and its ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nChanges in laws or regulations or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations may adversely affect Altus\u2019 business, investments, and results of operations.\nAltus is subject to laws, regulations, and rules enacted by national, regional, and local governments. In particular, the Company is required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq, and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with and monitoring of applicable laws, regulations, and rules may be difficult, time consuming, and costly. Those laws, regulations, and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time, and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, investments, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of Altus\u2019 income or other tax returns could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nAltus will be subject to income taxes in the United States, and its domestic tax liabilities may be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Altus\u2019 future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of Altus\u2019 deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where Altus has lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where Altus has higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, Altus may be subject to audits of its income, franchise, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) could adversely affect Altus\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a permanent reduction of the corporate income tax rate, and provisions that could impact or limit Altus\u2019 ability to deduct interest expense, or utilize net operating losses. The Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service are expected to continue to interpret and issue guidance relating to the application and administration of the TCJA. Any significant variance of Altus\u2019 current interpretation of this law from any future Treasury Regulations or administrative guidance could result in a change to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect its business.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like Altus to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nAltus qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As such, Altus is eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as Altus continues to be an emerging growth company, including:\n\u2022\nthe exemption from the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nthe exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency, and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements; and\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in Altus\u2019 periodic reports and proxy statements.\nAs a result, Altus\u2019 stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following April 4, 2022, the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering, (b) in which it has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of its Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of its prior second fiscal quarter (typically June 30th), and (ii) the date on which Altus has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nThe JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. While Altus does not intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, it has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, Altus, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of its financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nAltus cannot predict if investors will find its Class A Common Stock less attractive if it relies on these exemptions. If some investors find Altus\u2019 Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its Class A Common Stock, and its stock price may be more volatile.\nAltus\u2019 charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by its stockholders, which could limit its stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Altus or its directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nThe charter provides that, unless Altus consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (Court of Chancery) will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers, or other employees to it or its stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against the Company or any of its directors, officers, or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the charter, or the Company\u2019s bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against the Company or any of its directors, officers, or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThe above does not apply for such claims as to which:\n\u2022\nthe Court of Chancery determines that it does not have personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party;\n\u2022\nexclusive jurisdiction is vested in a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery; or\n\u2022\nthe Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of Altus\u2019 charter described in the preceding sentence. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of Altus\u2019 charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAltus\u2019 charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.", "PERMNO": 16673, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "ALTM"}
