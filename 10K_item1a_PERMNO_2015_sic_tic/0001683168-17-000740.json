{"cik": "1495932", "company": "EXP World Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have experienced net losses in recent years, and because we have a limited operating history, our ability to fully and successfully develop our business is unknown.\nWe have a history of operating at losses since our inception in October 2009, although a significant portion of our net losses for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 resulted from increases in intrinsic value of historical stock options, as further described throughout this annual report. Our ability to realize consistent, meaningful revenues and profit over a sustained period has not been established and cannot be assured.\nWhile we believe that we have made significant progress in revenue growth, and managing our overhead by implementing our cloud-based technology strategy, our services must achieve broad market acceptance by consumers and we must continue to grow our geographical reach, attract more agents and brokers, and increase the volume of our residential real-estate transactions. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to gain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business operations and could sustain on-going operating and net losses.\nDespite our ongoing efforts to build revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions, and to control the anticipated expenses associated with the continued development, marketing and provision of our services, we may not be able to generate significant net income from operations in the future.\nOur profitability is tied to the strength of the residential real estate market, which is subject to a number of macroeconomic conditions beyond our control.\nOur profitability is closely related to the strength of the residential real estate market which traditionally follows economic cycles and which can be impacted by national, state and local production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services from the economy. Macroeconomic conditions that could adversely impact our business include, but are not limited to, economic slowdown or recession, increased unemployment, increased energy costs, reductions in the availability of credit, increased costs of obtaining mortgages, an increase in foreclosure activity, rising interest rates, inflation, disruptions in capital markets, declines in the stock market, adverse tax policies or changes in other regulations, lower consumer confidence, lower wage and salary levels, war or terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the supply of money, or the public perception that any of these events may occur. In addition, federal and state governments, agencies and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could take actions that result in unforeseen consequences or that otherwise could negatively impact our business.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage rapid growth in our business.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet the growing needs of our affiliated real estate professionals and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed. As the Company adds new real estate professionals, we will need to devote additional financial and human resources to improving our internal systems, integrating with third-party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including support of our affiliated real estate professionals as our demographics expand over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced real estate professional satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our Company to existing real estate professionals who might leave the Company as well as resulting in decreased attraction of new real estate professionals. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to grow in the various local markets that we serve.\nTo capture and retain market share in the various local markets that we serve, we must compete successfully against other brokerages for agents and brokers and for the consumer relationships that they bring. Our competitors could lower the fees that they charge to agents and brokers or could raise the compensation structure for those agents. Our competitors may have access to greater financial resources than us, allowing them to undertake expensive local advertising or marketing efforts. In addition, our competitors may be able to leverage local relationships, referral sources, strong local brand and name recognition that we have not established. Our competitors could, as a result, have greater leverage in attracting new and established agents in the market and in generating business among local consumers. Our ability to grow in the local markets that we serve will depend on our ability to compete with these local brokerages.\nThe utilization of a 3D cloud based immersive office as a suitable substitute for a physical brick and mortar location is a new and unproven strategy and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to operate and grow within its confines.\nCurrently, our cloud office adequately supports the needs of our agent population located across the United States and Canada. We cannot guarantee that our cloud office platform will continue to support our agent population and meet our business needs as we grow. The effectiveness of our cloud office platform is tied to a number of variables at any given time including server capacity and concurrent users. In addition, we do not own certain technology upon which we depend to provide our 3D immersive cloud office platform. Our need to license this technology exposes us to the risk that we are unable to maintain agreements with our vendor on favorable terms in the future. It is possible that disruptions to certain of our services could result from an unexpected switch in vendors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the use of the cloud office platform, and the use generally of 3D immersive office environments as an acceptable substitute among agents and brokers for physical office locations is unproven. We cannot guarantee that industry rank and file will adopt or accept cloud-based 3D office environments as a substitute for a physical office environment in a sustainable, long-term manner.\nWe face significant risk to our brand and revenue if we fail to maintain compliance with the law and regulations of federal, state, foreign, county governmental authorities, or private associations and governing boards\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry with regulated labor classifications which present significant risk in general for each potential instance where we fail to maintain compliance.\nOur brokers and can be classified as an employee or independent contractor and we could potentially misclassify or fail to consistently achieve compliance. Classifications and compliance are subject to the Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines and penalties.\nClassifications, regulations and guidelines for brokers and agents are subject to judicial and agency interpretation as well as periodic changes. Changes, or any indication of changes, may adversely impact our workforce classifications, expenses, compensation, commission structure, roles and responsibilities and broker organization.\nBeyond workforce regulations and classifications, there exist complex, heavily regulated federal, state, foreign, local authority laws and regulations and national, state, foreign and local third party organization\u2019s regulations, policies and bylaws governing our real estate business.\nIn general, the laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business practices include, without limitation, the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the federal Fair Housing Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and federal advertising and other laws, as well as comparable state statutes; rules of trade organization such as NAR, local MLSs, and state and local AORs; licensing requirements and related obligations that could arise from our business practices relating to the provision of services other than real estate brokerage services; privacy regulations relating to our use of personal information collected from the registered users of our websites; laws relating to the use and publication of information through the Internet; and state real estate brokerage licensing requirements, as well as statutory due diligence, disclosure, record keeping and standard-of-care obligations relating to these licenses.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (\u201cMortgage Act\u201d), which imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans, by amending certain existing provisions and adding new sections to RESPA and other federal laws. It also broadly prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and knowingly or recklessly providing substantial assistance to a covered person in violation of that prohibition. The penalties for noncompliance with these laws are also significantly increased by the Mortgage Act, which could lead to an increase in lawsuits against mortgage lenders and servicers.\nMaintaining legal compliance is challenging and increases our costs due to resources required to continually monitor business practices for compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to monitor changes in the applicable laws themselves.\nWe may not become aware of all the laws, rules and regulations that govern our business, or be able to comply with all of them, given the rate of regulatory changes, ambiguities in regulations, contradictions in regulations between jurisdictions, and the difficulties in achieving both company-wide and region-specific knowledge and compliance.\nIf we fail, or we have alleged to have failed, to comply with any existing or future applicable laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to lawsuits and administrative complaints and proceedings, as well as criminal proceedings. Our noncompliance could result in significant defense costs, settlement costs, damages and penalties.\nOur business licenses could be suspended or revoked, our business practices enjoined, or we could be required to modify our business practices, which could materially impair, or even prevent, our ability to conduct all or any portion of our business. Any such events could also damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract and service home buyers, home sellers and agents, as well our ability to attract brokerages, brokers, teams of agents and agents to our company, without increasing our costs.\nWe do carry general liability insurance; however, insurance may not cover all claims or claims of these types or may be inadequate to protect us from all liability.\nFurther, if we lose our ability to obtain and maintain all of the regulatory approvals and licenses necessary to conduct business as we currently operate, our ability to conduct business may be harmed. Lastly, any lobbying or related activities we undertake in response to mitigate liability of current or new regulations could substantially increase our operating expenses.\nIf we do not remain an innovative leader in the real estate industry, we may not be able to grow our business and leverage our costs to achieve profitability.\nInnovation has been critical to our ability to compete against other brokerages for clients and agents. For example, we have pioneered the utilization of a 3D immersive online office environment in the residential real estate market which reduces our need for office space and facilitates the transaction of business away from an office. If competitors follow our practices or develop innovative practices, our ability to achieve profitability may diminish or erode. For example, certain other brokerages could develop or license cloud-based office platforms that are equal to or superior to ours. If we do not remain on the forefront of innovation, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe market for Internet products and services including, without limitation, 3D immersive experiences, virtual reality and augmented reality is characterized by rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards and customer demands, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The Company\u2019s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its Internet-based virtual environment, its tools and other properties in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so. In addition, the widespread adoption of new virtual reality and augmented reality applications through new technology developments could require fundamental changes in the Company\u2019s services.\nOur value proposition for agents and brokers includes allowing them to participate in the gross revenues of our company and is not typical in the real estate industry. If agents and brokers do not understand our value proposition or value its attributes, we may not be able to attract, retain and incentivize agents.\nParticipation in our gross revenue sharing plan represents a key component of our agent and broker value proposition. Agents and brokers may not understand or appreciate its value. In addition, agents may not appreciate other components of our value proposition including the cloud office platform, the mobility it affords, the systems and tools that we provide to agents and brokers, and the professional development opportunities we create and deliver. If agents and brokers do not understand the elements of our agent value proposition, or do not perceive it to be more valuable than the models used by most competitors, we may not be able to attract, retain and incentivize new and existing agents and brokers to grow our revenues.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other real estate brokerages for qualified brokers who manage our operations in each state. We must also compete with technology companies for developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled service and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or continues to experience significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nAs we pursue new lines of business and opportunities to increase revenues, our profit margins may decline sharply.\nWe may implement changes to the business model and operations to improve revenues that cause a disproportionate increase in our expenses and cost of goods sold, or reduce profit margins. For example, we may allocate resources to acquiring lower margin brokerage models, the development of a mortgage servicing division, a commercial real estate division, a title and escrow company or a continuing education division. These decisions could involve significant start-up costs that may only be recovered after lengthy periods of time. Any of these attempts to improve our revenues could result in a disproportionate increase in our expenses and in reduced profit margins. In addition, any of these additional activities could expose us to additional compliance obligations and regulatory risks.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonality and vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year, making meaningful comparisons of successive quarters difficult.\nSeasons and weather, while seemingly predictable, traditionally impact the real estate industry. Continuous poor weather or natural disasters negatively impact listings and sales. Spring and summer seasons historically reflect greater sales periods in comparison to fall and winter seasons. Seasonal or weather related lower revenue also reduces our operating income, net income, operating margins and cash flow.\nReal estate listings precede sales and a period of poor listings activity will negatively impact revenue. Past performance be it weather, seasons, prior month or prior quarter is no assurance or predictor of the following month\u2019s or quarter\u2019s revenue and macroeconomic shifts in the markets served could conceal the impact of poor weather or seasonality.\nHome sales in successive quarters can fluctuate widely due to holidays, national or international emergencies, the school year calendar\u2019s impact on relocation and/or interest rate changes or speculation of pending interest rate changes. Our revenue and operating margins each quarter will remain subject to seasonal fluctuations, poor weather and natural disasters, combined with macroeconomic market changes may make it difficult to compare or analyze our financial performance effectively across successive quarters.\nIf we fail to protect the privacy of employees, independent contractors, or consumers or personal information that they share with us, our reputation and business could be significantly harmed.\nTens of thousands of consumers, independent contractors, and employees have shared personal information with us during the normal course of our business processing residential real estate transactions. This includes, but is not limited to, social security numbers, annual income amounts and sources, consumer names, addresses, telephone and cell phone numbers, and email addresses.\nOur application, disclosure and safeguard of the information is regulated by federal and state privacy laws. To comply with privacy laws, we invested resources and adopted a privacy policy outlining the use and care as well as how and with whom we may share personal information. This policy includes informing consumers, independent contractors and employees that we will not share their personal information with third parties without their consent unless required by law.\nPrivacy policies and compliance with federal and state privacy laws presents risk and could incur legal liability for failing to maintain compliance. We may not become aware of all privacy laws, changes to privacy laws, or third party privacy regulations governing the real estate business, or be unable to comply with all of these regulations, given the rate of regulatory changes, ambiguities in regulations, contradictions in regulations between jurisdictions, and the difficulties in achieving both company-wide and region-specific knowledge and compliance.\nOur policy and safeguards could be deemed insufficient if third parties with whom we have shared personal information fail to protect the privacy of that information. Our legal liability could include significant defense costs, settlement costs, damages and penalties, plus, damage our reputation with consumers, which could significantly damage our ability to attract and maintain customers. Any or all of these consequences would result in meaningful unfavorable impact on our brand, business model, revenue, expenses, income and margins.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand, maintain and improve the systems and technologies upon which we rely on to operate.\nAs the number of agents and brokers in our company grows, our success will depend on our ability to expand, maintain and improve the technology that supports our business operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud office platform. Loss of key personnel or the lack of adequate staffing with the requisite expertise and training could impede our efforts in this regard. If our systems and technologies lack capacity or quality sufficient to service agents and their clients, then the number of agents who wish to use our products could decrease, the level of client service and transaction volume afforded by our systems could suffer, and our costs could increase. In addition, if our systems, procedures or controls are not adequate to provide reliable, accurate and timely financial and other reporting, we may not be able to satisfy regulatory scrutiny or contractual obligations with third parties and may suffer a loss of reputation. Any of these events could negatively affect our financial position.\nOur business, financial condition and reputation may be substantially harmed by security breaches, interruptions, delays and failures in our systems and operations.\nThe performance and reliability of our systems and operations are critical to our reputation and ability to attract agents, teams of agents and brokers into our company as well as our ability to service home buyers and sellers. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to security breaches, interruption or malfunction due to certain events beyond our control, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fire and flood, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. In addition, we rely on third party vendors to provide the cloud office platform and to provide additional systems and related support. If we cannot continue to retain these services on acceptable terms, our access to these systems and services could be interrupted. Any security breach, interruption, delay or failure in our systems and operations could substantially reduce the transaction volume that can be processed with our systems, impair quality of service, increase costs, prompt litigation and other consumer claims, and damage our reputation, any of which could substantially harm our financial condition.\nLoss of our current executive officers or other key management could significantly harm our business.\nWe depend on the industry experience and talent of our current executives, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Sanford; and President and General Counsel, Russell Cofano, Chief Financial Officer Alan Goldman and Chief Executive Officer of eXp Realty, Jason Gesing. We believe that our future results will depend in part upon our ability to retain and attract highly skilled and qualified management. The loss of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our operations because other officers may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. This is especially relevant because we have not entered into an employment agreement with either our chairman and chief executive officer or our president. To the extent that one or more of our top executives or other key management personnel depart from the Company, our operations and business prospects may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in executives and key personnel could be disruptive to our business. The Company does not have any key person insurance.\nFailure to protect intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights, are important assets of the business. We have taken measures to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may not be sufficient or effective. We may bring lawsuits to protect against the potential infringement of our intellectual property rights; other companies, including our competitors, could make claims against us alleging our infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nWe may evaluate potential vendors, suppliers and other business partners for acquisition in order to accelerate growth, but may not succeed in identifying suitable candidates or may acquire businesses that negatively impact us.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may evaluate the potential acquisition of businesses offering products or services that complement our services offerings. If we identify a business that we deem to be suitable for acquisition and complete an acquisition, our evaluation may prove faulty and the acquisition may prove unsuccessful. In addition, an acquisition may prove unsuccessful to us because of our inability to effectively execute post-acquisition strategy. We may be unable to successfully integrate the systems and personnel of the acquired businesses. An acquisition could negatively impact our culture or undermine its core values. Acquisitions could disrupt our existing operations or cause management to neglect to focus adequately on our core business. An acquisition could cause potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or could cause us to assume or incur unknown or unforeseen liabilities. We intend to evaluate other brokerages for acquisition in order to accelerate growth and may not succeed in identifying suitable candidates or may acquire brokerages that negatively impact us.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the United States and other markets that we enter and operate within could negatively impact our financial performance.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, in the United States and other markets we enter and operate within could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our services in the United States. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce spending by forgoing real estate purchases. Lower consumer demand for our services in the United States and other markets could reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings, including treble damages, may harm our business and financial condition. Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, negligence and fiduciary duty claims arising from our company owned brokerage operations, actions against our title company alleging it knew or should have known others were committing mortgage fraud, standard brokerage disputes like the failure to disclose hidden defects in the property such as mold, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including our agents, brokers, third-party service or product provides, antitrust claims, general fraud claims and employment law claims, including claims challenging the classification of our employees as independent contractors and compliance with wage and hour regulations, and claims alleging violations of RESPA or state consumer fraud statutes. In addition, class action lawsuits can often be particularly vexatious litigation given the breadth of claims, the large potential damages claimed and the significant costs of defense. The risks of litigation become magnified, and the costs of settlement increase, in class actions in which the courts grant partial or full certification of a large class. In the case of intellectual property litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of business processes or technology that is subject to third party patents or other third party intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms) and be required to pay royalties.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. We know of no material, active or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.\nWe may suffer significant financial harm and loss of reputation if we do not comply, cannot comply, or are alleged to have not complied with applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning our classification and compensation practices for the agents in our owned-and-operated brokerage.\nExcept for our employed state brokers, all real estate professionals in our brokerage operations have been retained as independent contractors, either directly or indirectly through third-party entities formed by these independent contractors for their business purposes. With respect to these independent contractors, like most brokerage firms, we are subject to the Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it might be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable to any of our affiliated real estate professionals. Further, if legal standards for classification of real estate professionals as independent contractors change or appear to be changing, it may be necessary to modify our compensation and benefits structure for our affiliated real estate professionals in some or all of our markets, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses.\nIn the future we could incur substantial costs, penalties and damages, including back pay, unpaid benefits, taxes, expense reimbursement and attorneys\u2019 fees, in defending future challenges by our affiliated real estate professionals to our employment classification or compensation practices.\nRisk Related to Our Stock\nGlenn Sanford, our Principal Executive Officer and Chairman, owns a significant percentage of our stock, and as a result, the trading price for our shares may be depressed and he can take actions that may be adverse to the interests of our stockholders.\nGlenn Sanford beneficially owns approximately 41% of our outstanding common stock as of March 15, 2017. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with a controlling stockholder. Mr. Sanford may have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, due to his significant ownership stake and his service as our Principal Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and Director, Mr. Sanford controls the management of our business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to our other stockholders.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 220,000,000 shares of common stock, of which approximately 52.4 million shares were issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2017. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.\nOur board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our stockholders and we have several equity based compensation plans in place for employees and non-employees. Consequently, all stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.\nOur common stock is illiquid and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors which are unrelated to our operations.\nAlthough our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the OTCQB (Symbol \u201cEXPI\u201d) operated by the OTC Markets Group, trading through the OTCQB is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in our stock, in which case it could be difficult for shareholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nTrading of our stock is restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as \u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit an investor\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nOur results of operations are subject to fluctuation that is outside of our control based on the required method of valuing certain historical stock options in a manner tied to the Company\u2019s stock price.\nPrior to becoming a public company in 2013, we issued approximately 7.1 million options convertible into restricted and unregistered shares of common stock. Subsequent to becoming a public company, and in accordance with US GAAP, we are required to remeasure the intrinsic value of these awards at each reporting date through the date of exercise or other settlement. The changes are recorded as a component of earnings and included in general and administrative expenses. Based on our current analysis, a 10% change in the intrinsic value of the options, in consideration of quoted market prices as of December 31, 2016, would potentially result in the recognition of approximately $2,617,000 of compensation expense (benefit). Additionally, the recognition of any significant fluctuation in the intrinsic value of these outstanding awards could swing operating results from a loss to income, and vice versa, in future periods.", "PERMNO": 17812, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "EXPI"}
