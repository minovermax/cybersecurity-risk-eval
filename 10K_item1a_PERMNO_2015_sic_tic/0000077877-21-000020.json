RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nRisks Relating to the Global COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur operations have been adversely affected as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on crude oil demand and pricing. We expect those impacts to continue in the near-term and we may experience additional impacts in the future. For example:\n\u2022Prolonged depressed crude oil prices may have adverse effects on the financial wellbeing of our business, including with respect to revenue, profitability, cash flows and liquidity; quantity and present value of our reserves; the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility; and access to other sources of capital;\n\u2022Negative financial impacts may lead to distress and restructuring events affecting working interest partners, vendors, contractors, service providers and other counterparties;\n\u2022Negative financial impacts to our business partners may cause delays or failure to pay service providers, which could result in liens being filed against our real and personal property;\n\u2022Reduced capital spending and declines in revenues have led to temporary and permanent reductions in our work force and decreases to our director, executive and employee compensation, which may affect our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel;\n\u2022Our reduced drilling program may result in losses of acreage due to lease expirations, which could result in impairment charges and the loss of future drilling opportunities;\n\u2022State and local orders, ordinances and guidance related to COVID-19 have forced a significant portion of our employees to work remotely, which may result in decreased productivity and continuity among the employee base;\n\u2022Current market conditions and impacts on our business generally may lead to an increased risk of litigation; and\n\u2022The cumulative effects of COVID-19 on the economy may result in a long-term global recession or depression.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate and declines in these prices, or an extended period of low prices, can significantly affect the value of our assets and our financial results and may impede our growth.\nOur revenue, profitability, cash flows and liquidity depend in large part upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Changes in prices affect many aspects of our business, including:\n\u2022our revenue, profitability and cash flows;\n\u2022our liquidity;\n\u2022the quantity and present value of our reserves;\n\u2022the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and access to other sources of capital; and\n\u2022the nature and scale of our operations.\nThe markets for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are often volatile, and prices may fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u2022relatively minor changes in regional, national or global supply and demand;\n\u2022regional, national or global economic conditions, and perceived trends in those conditions;\n\u2022geopolitical factors, such as events that may reduce or increase production from particular oil-producing regions and/or from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\"), and global events, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022regulatory changes.\nThe price of oil has historically been volatile, due in recent years to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply and global economic concerns. As a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions of members of OPEC, in 2020, oil prices ranged from highs of approximately $59 per barrel to lows of approximately negative $40 per barrel\n(due to depressed demand and insufficient storage capacity, particularly at the WTI physical settlement location in Cushing, Oklahoma). Prices for natural gas and NGLs have also experienced substantial volatility. If we reduce our capital expenditures due to low prices, natural declines in production from our wells will likely result in reduced production and therefore reduced cash flow from operations, which would in turn further limit our ability to make the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves and production.\nIn addition to factors affecting the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs generally, the prices we receive for our production are affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. The prices that we receive for our production are generally lower than the relevant benchmark prices that are used for calculating commodity derivative positions. These differences, or differentials, are difficult to predict and may widen or narrow in the future based on market forces. Differentials can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors and the terms of our sales contracts. Over the longer term, differentials will be significantly affected by factors such as investment decisions made by providers of midstream facilities and services, refineries and other industry participants and the overall regulatory and economic climate. For example, increases in U.S. domestic oil production generally, or in production from particular basins, may result in widening differentials. We may be materially and adversely impacted by widening differentials on our production and decreasing commodity prices.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that adversely affect the cost and manner of doing business. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to us could increase our costs, impose additional operating restrictions or have other adverse effects on us.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning crude oil and natural gas wells and associated facilities. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage and natural resource or other damages, and could be required to change, suspend or terminate operations. A summary of certain laws and regulations that apply to us and some potential changes to those laws and regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Governmental Regulation. Any of the currently applicable laws and regulations could be amended, including in ways that we do not anticipate, and those changes could adversely affect our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have been subject to sanctions and lawsuits relating to alleged noncompliance with regulatory requirements. For example, in October 2017, in order to settle a lawsuit brought against us by the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA and the State of Colorado, we entered into a consent decree pursuant to which we paid a fine and agreed to implement certain operational changes. The lawsuit claimed that we failed to operate and maintain certain equipment in compliance with applicable law. In addition, as a result of the SRC Acquisition, we are subject to the obligations and requirements of a 2018 Compliance Order on Consent (\u201cCOC\u201d) entered into by SRC with CDPHE, applicable to certain SRC oil and gas production facilities we acquired from SRC. The COC resolved SRC\u2019s alleged violations related to storage tank emissions and contains requirements similar to those contained in our consent decree.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate also changes frequently, often through the imposition of new or more stringent environmental and other requirements, some of which may apply retroactively. We cannot predict the nature, timing, cost or effect of such additional requirements, but they may have a variety of adverse effects on us. The types of regulatory changes that could impact our operations vary widely and include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022As discussed in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties - Governmental Regulation, the COGCC completed extensive rulemaking hearings under SB 19-181 in 2020, which resulted in the adoption of new requirements for setbacks, permitting, siting cumulative and surface impacts, asset transfers, venting and flaring, and remediation. The implementation of the final rules, particularly as they relate to mandatory setbacks between wells and building units, could have a significant adverse effect on our unpermitted locations and therefore on our future inventory and reserves. Other final rules could have a significant adverse effect on our future operations as well. The COGCC is still in the process of issuing guidance and direction regarding the new requirements, and we cannot predict the impact of these requirements on our inventory and operations.\n\u2022Substantially all of our drilling activities involve the use of hydraulic fracturing, and proposals are made from time to time at the federal, state and local levels to further regulate, or to ban, hydraulic fracturing practices. Additional laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could, among other things, increase our costs, reduce our inventory of economically viable drilling locations and reduce our reserves.\n\u2022Federal and various state, local and regional governmental authorities have implemented, or considered implementing, regulations that seek to limit or discourage the emission of carbon, methane and other GHGs. For example, the EPA has made findings and issued regulations that require us to establish and report an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, and the state of Colorado has adopted rules regulating methane emissions from oil and gas operations. Additional laws or regulations intended to restrict the emission of GHGs could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we sell. These new laws or rules could, among other things, require us to install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. In addition, like other energy companies, we could be named as a defendant in GHG-related lawsuits.\n\u2022Proposals are made from time to time to amend U.S. federal and state tax laws in ways that would be adverse to us, including by eliminating certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The changes could include (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for crude oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Also, state severance taxes may increase in the states in which we operate. This could adversely affect our existing operations in the relevant state and the economic viability of future drilling.\n\u2022The development of new environmental initiatives or regulations related to the acquisition, withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater or treatment and discharge of water waste, may limit our ability to use techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, increase our development and operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nA substantial part of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production is located in the Wattenberg Field, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing formations.\nAlthough we have significant leasehold positions in the Delaware Basin in Texas, our current production is primarily located in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. Because our production is not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including natural disasters, government regulations and midstream interruptions.\nFor example, bottlenecks in processing and transportation that have occurred in some recent periods in the Wattenberg Field have negatively affected our results of operations, and these adverse effects may be disproportionately severe to us compared to our more geographically diverse competitors. Similarly, the concentration of our producing assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules that could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the Wattenberg Field and the Delaware Basin, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, chemicals, personnel and oilfield services often increase as well. Any shortages or increased costs could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital forecast, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. All of the producing properties and reserves we acquired in the SRC Acquisition are located in the Wattenberg Field. As a result, the transaction increased the risks we face with respect to the geographic concentration of our properties.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities, the capacity and operation of which we do not control. Market conditions or operational impediments affecting midstream facilities and services could hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGL markets, increase our costs or delay production. Our efforts to address midstream issues may not be successful.\nOur ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. If adequate midstream facilities and services are not available to us on a timely basis and at acceptable costs, our production may be curtailed and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition to causing production curtailments, capacity constraints can also reduce the price we receive for the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce.\nWe rely on third parties to continue to construct additional midstream facilities and related infrastructure to accommodate our growth, and the ability and willingness of those parties to do so is subject to a variety of risks. For example:\n\u2022Decreases in commodity prices in recent years have resulted in reduced investment in midstream facilities by some third parties;\n\u2022Various interest groups have protested the construction of new pipelines, and particularly pipelines near water bodies, in various places throughout the country, and protests have at times physically interrupted pipeline construction activities;\n\u2022Some upstream energy companies have sought to reject volume commitment agreements with midstream providers in bankruptcy proceedings, and the risk that such efforts will succeed, or that upstream energy company counterparties will otherwise be unable or unwilling to satisfy their volume commitments, may have the effect of reducing investment in midstream infrastructure; and\n\u2022The possibility that new or amended regulations, including regulations that increase mandatory setbacks or enhance local control of oil and gas development, could result in severely curtailed drilling activities in Colorado and may discourage investment in midstream facilities.\nLike other producers, we from time to time enter into volume commitments with midstream providers in order to induce them to provide increased capacity. If our production falls below the level required under these agreements, we could be subject to substantial penalties.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expiration to hold the acreage by production. In highly competitive markets for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in substantial lease renewal costs or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering our undeveloped acreage, our leases for such acreage will expire. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Unexpected lease expirations could occur if our actual drilling activities differ materially from our current expectations, and this could result in impairment charges. The risk of lease expiration is greater at times and in areas where the pace of our exploration and development activity slows. Our ability to drill and develop the locations necessary to maintain our leases depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest or acquire.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform record title examinations before we acquire oil and gas leases and related interests. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and within applicable environmental rules.\nDrilling and development activities such as hydraulic fracturing require the use of water and result in the production of wastewater. Our operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. The quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints, supply concerns and regulatory issues, particularly in relatively arid climates such as eastern Colorado and western Texas. For example, increased drilling activity in the Delaware Basin in recent years has led to heightened concerns about water supply\nissues in the area and this may lead to regulatory actions, including rules providing local governments greater authority over water use, that adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations depend on being able to reuse or dispose of wastewater in a timely and economic fashion. Wastewater from oil and gas operations is often disposed of through underground injection. Wells in the Delaware Basin typically produce relatively large amounts of water that require disposal and an increased number of earthquakes have been detected in the Delaware Basin in recent years. Some studies have linked earthquakes, or induced seismicity, in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to increased public and regulatory scrutiny of injection safety. For example, in November 2020, the COGCC adopted various new requirements on the underground injection of fluid waste.\nReduced commodity prices could result in significant impairment charges and significant downward revisions of proved reserves.\nCommodity prices are volatile. Significant and rapid declines in prices have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Low commodity prices could result in, among other things, significant impairment charges in the future. For example, we incurred impairment charges in a number of recent periods, including charges of $882.4 million and $38.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to write down assets. Similarly, the significant decline in commodity pricing during 2020 resulted in a reduced year-end proved reserve NYMEX price of $39.57 per barrel of crude and $1.99 per MMBtu of natural gas, a decrease of 29% and 23% respectively from 2019. The decline in pricing resulted in a downward revision of 28.2 MMBoe to reserves for year-end 2020 when compared to year-end 2019. The cash flow model we use to assess properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management\u2019s estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices, the outlook for forward commodity prices and operating and development costs. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date the estimate of future cash flows is made for each producing basin. A significant decrease in long-term forward prices could result in a significant impairment for our properties.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating and evaluating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, revisions in existing reserve estimates occur. Significant inputs and assumptions to the valuation of proved crude oil and natural gas properties include estimates of reserves volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices, and a market based weighted average cost of capital rate. In determining the estimates of reserve and economic evaluations, management utilizes independent petroleum engineers. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be inaccurate. The reserve estimates are based on assumptions regarding commodity prices, production levels and operating and development costs that may prove to be incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual results could greatly affect:\n\u2022the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties;\n\u2022future depreciation, depletion and amortization (\u201cDD&A\u201d) rates and amounts;\n\u2022impairments in the value of our assets;\n\u2022the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery;\n\u2022estimates of future net cash flows;\n\u2022timing of our capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the amount of funds available for us to borrow under our revolving credit facility.\nSome of our reserve estimates must be made with limited production histories, which renders these estimates less reliable than those based on longer production histories. Further, reserve estimates are based on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that are anticipated to be economically recoverable from a given date forward based on economic conditions that exist at that date. The actual quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs recovered will be different than the reserve estimates, in part because they will not be produced under the same economic conditions as are used for the reserve calculations. In addition, quantities of probable and possible reserves by definition are inherently more risky than proved reserves, in part because they have greater uncertainty associated with the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 56 percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately $2.3 billion during the five years ending December 31, 2025, as estimated in the calculation of our standardized measure of oil and gas activity. The estimated development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of initial booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nThe present value of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of those reserves. Pursuant to SEC rules, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves, and the estimated quantity of those reserves, are based on the prior year\u2019s first day of the month 12-month average crude oil and natural gas index prices. However, factors such as actual prices we receive for crude oil and natural gas and hedging instruments, the amount and timing of actual production, the amount and timing of future development costs, the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and changes in governmental regulations or taxation, also affect our actual future net cash flows from our properties. The timing of both our production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows (the rate required by the SEC) may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates currently in effect and risks associated with our properties or the industry in general.\nUnless reserves are replaced as they are produced, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop our identified drilling locations as planned.\nProducing crude oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that may vary over time and exceed our estimates depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current reserves and to economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, discover or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our future operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified a number of well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022drilling and production costs;\n\u2022availability and cost of drilling rigs, and equipment, supplies, chemicals, personnel and oilfield services;\n\u2022drilling results;\n\u2022lease expirations or limitations as to depth;\n\u2022midstream constraints;\n\u2022access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems;\n\u2022regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022other factors.\nBecause of these factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential well locations. In addition, the number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. Further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties. Some states, including Colorado, allow the involuntary pooling of tracts in a relatively broad number of circumstances in order to facilitate exploration, though Colorado now requires applicants to own or\nsecure consent from the owners of more than 45 percent of the minerals to be pooled. Other states, notably Texas, restrict involuntary pooling to a much narrower set of circumstances and consequently these states rely primarily on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In states such as Texas where pooling is accomplished primarily on a voluntary basis, or in states such as Colorado if we cannot meet the minimum requirement for ownership and consent, it may be more difficult to form units and, therefore, more difficult to fully develop a project if we own less than all (or cannot secure the ownership or consent of the required minimum amount) of the leasehold in the proposed units or one or more of our leases in the proposed units does not provide the necessary pooling authority. If third parties in the proposed units are unwilling to pool their interests with ours, we may be unable to require such pooling on a timely basis or at all, which would limit the total horizontal wells we can drill. Further, the number of available locations will depend in part on the expected lateral lengths of the horizontal wells we drill. Because the intended lateral length of a horizontal well is subject to change for a variety of reasons, our estimated drilling locations will change over time. For this and numerous other reasons, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nOur inventory of drilling projects includes locations in addition to those that we currently classify as proved, probable and possible. The development of and results from these additional projects are more uncertain than those relating to probable and possible locations, and significantly more uncertain than those relating to proved locations. We have generally accelerated the pace of our development activities in the Wattenberg Field over the past several years, and this has reduced our related inventory of drilling locations. We anticipate that our remaining locations in the field will not, on average, be as productive or as economic as many of those we have drilled in recent years, due to lower anticipated overall production or higher gas-to-oil ratios. In the Delaware Basin, our inventory is subject to, among other things, potential lease expirations and our continued analysis of geologic challenges in certain areas.\nThe wells we drill may not yield crude oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities and productive wells may be less successful than we expect.\nA prospect is a property on which our geologists have identified what they believe, based on available information, to be indications of hydrocarbon-bearing rocks. However, given the limitations of available data and technology, our geologists cannot know conclusively prior to drilling and testing whether crude oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present in sufficient quantities to repay drilling or completion costs and generate a profit. Furthermore, even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques do not enable our geologists to be certain as to the quantity of the hydrocarbons in those structures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline. If a well is determined to be dry or uneconomic, which can occur even though it contains some crude oil, natural gas or NGLs, it is classified as a dry hole and must be plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable regulations. This generally results in the loss of the entire cost of drilling and completion to that point, the cost of plugging and lease costs associated with the prospect. Even wells that are completed and placed into production may not produce sufficient crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to be profitable, or they may be less productive and/or profitable than we expected. For example, the data we use to model anticipated results from wells in a particular area may prove to be not representative of actual results from typical wells in the area, and this could result in production that falls short of estimates reflected in our internal business plans and/or guidance, \"type curve\" or other disclosures we make to the public. This risk is higher for us in certain areas in the Delaware Basin that have relatively complex geological characteristics and correspondingly greater variability in well results. In addition, initial results from a well are not necessarily indicative of its performance over a longer period.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling can be unprofitable, not only due to dry holes, but also due to curtailments, delays or cancellations as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022pressures or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022floods, winter storms and other natural disasters and adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022loss of well control;\n\u2022loss of drilling fluid circulation and other facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022unexpected operational events;\n\u2022shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services;\n\u2022unanticipated environmental liabilities; and\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory penalties. For example, a loss of containment of hydrocarbons during drilling activities could potentially subject us to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of substantial costs, including for environmental remediation. We maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations; however, insurance against certain operational risks may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risks presented. For example, we may not have coverage with respect to a pollution event if we are unaware of the event while it is occurring and are therefore unable to report the occurrence of the event to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. Thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or for amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance and/or governmental or third-party responses to an event could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently involved in various remedial and investigatory activities at some of our wells and related sites.\nIn addition, certain technical risks relating to the drilling of horizontal wells - including those relating to our ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages and to successfully run casing the length of the well bore - have increased in recent years because we have increased the average lateral length of the horizontal wells we drill. Longer-lateral wells are also typically more expensive and require more time for preparation. In addition, we have transitioned to the use of multi-well pads instead of single-well sites. The use of multi-well pad drilling increases some operational risks because problems affecting the pad or a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. Pad drilling can also make our overall production, and therefore our revenue and cash flows, more volatile, because production from multiple wells on a pad will typically commence simultaneously. While we believe that we will be better served by using multi-well pads with longer lateral wells, the risk component involved in such drilling will be increased in some respects, with the result that we might find it more difficult to achieve economic success in our drilling program.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers or other counterparties to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales or joint interest billings to a small number of third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may affect our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, our commodity derivatives expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Nonperformance by our customers or derivative counterparties may adversely affect our financial condition and profitability. We face similar risks with respect to our other counterparties, including the lenders under our revolving credit facility and the providers of our insurance coverage.\nWe participate in oil and gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than all of the working interest in the oil and gas leases on which we conduct operations. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities, arising from the actions of the other owners. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners does not pay its share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover the costs from the partner. This could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement those or other new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we were unable to use the most advanced technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nOur industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects or evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, larger companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low commodity prices. Larger competitors may also be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These factors could adversely affect our operations and our profitability.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nA failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our ability to replace our reserves and impact our financial condition.\nBecause our crude oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets, our future reserves, production volumes and cash flows depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. In addition, we continue to strive to achieve greater efficiencies in our drilling program, and our ability to do so is dependent in part on our ability to complete asset exchanges and other acquisitions that allow us to increase our working interests in particular properties. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, and if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions of properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\nAcquisitions of producing and undeveloped properties, including the SRC Acquisition, have been an important part of our growth over time. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, development potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, title issues and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we generally perform engineering, environmental, geological and geophysical reviews of the acquired properties that we believe are generally consistent with customary industry practices. However, such reviews are not likely to permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well prior to an acquisition and our ability to evaluate undeveloped acreage is inherently imprecise. Even when we inspect a well, we may not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. In some cases, our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited. In addition, we often acquire acreage without any warranty of title except as to claims made by, through or under the transferor.\nWhen we acquire properties, we will generally have potential exposure to liabilities and costs for environmental and other problems existing on the acquired properties, and these liabilities may exceed our estimates. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification associated with acquired properties. We often acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with no or limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. Therefore, we could incur significant unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities or losses due to title defects, in connection with acquisitions for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. In addition, the acquisition of undeveloped acreage is subject to many inherent risks and we may not be able to realize efficiently, or at all, the assumed or expected economic benefits of acreage that we acquire.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or may be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. These factors can increase the risks associated with an acquisition. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nThe SRC Acquisition presented a number of the foregoing risks - for example, because closing has occurred, we have no recourse if we discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems with the properties we acquired in the transaction. In addition, those risks are greater than they were in the case of most of our previous acquisitions given the larger size of the SRC Acquisition.\nSome of our acquisitions are structured as asset trades or exchanges. These transactions may give rise to any or all of the foregoing risks. In addition, transactions of this type create a risk that we will undervalue the properties we transfer to the counterparty in the trade or exchange or overvalue the properties we receive. Such an undervaluation or overvaluation would result in the transaction being less favorable to us than we expected.\nWe operate in a litigious environment. The cost of defending any suits brought against us, and any judgments or settlements resulting from such suits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, employment litigation, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. For example, on January 18, 2021, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us by a royalty owner alleging we have been improperly deducting certain post-production costs from the owner\u2019s oil royalty payments. While we intend to vigorously defend this suit, the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management attention and other factors. In addition, the resolution of such a proceeding could result in penalties or sanctions, settlement costs and/or judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties, sanctions or costs may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or the anticipated range of potential losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material. Information regarding legal proceedings can be found in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation and Legal\nItems included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, competitive information or to render data or systems corrupted or unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to them will be sufficient to prevent them from materializing.\nOur industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, as well as cloud applications and services, to store, transmit, process and record sensitive information (including but not limited to trade secrets, employee information and financial and operating data), communicate with our employees and business partners, and for many other activities related to our business. In addition, computer systems control the oil and gas production and processing equipment that are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption or failure of these systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, may cause damage to critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, or make it difficult to accurately account for production and settle transactions. The continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention, which could potentially elevate costs, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties and potential legal liability.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased in our industry, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, have also increased. Our systems and infrastructure are, and those of our business partners, including vendors, service providers, operating partners, purchasers of our production and financial institutions may be, subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We and our business partners also face various other cyber-security threats from criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusion, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, theft of property or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Although we have not suffered material losses related to cyber-attacks to date, if we were successfully attacked, we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, such as a loss of competitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations. Events of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, as the sophistication of cyber-attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities.\nThe physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nMany scientists believe that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere are changing global climate patterns. One consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods. If such events were to occur, or become more frequent, our operations could be adversely affected in various ways, including through damage to our facilities or from increased costs for insurance.\nAnother possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for natural gas is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market for the fuels that we produce. As a result, if there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Financial Matters\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our production and reserves, and ultimately our profitability. Lender hesitancy to offer financing to our industry may increase this risk.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated from operations and proceeds from capital markets transactions and the sale of properties. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures utilizing similar financing sources. Our cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022the prices at which crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022the costs to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs; and\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties or for any other reason, our need for capital from other sources could increase, and there can be no assurance that such other sources of capital would be available at that time on reasonable terms or at all. If we raise funds by issuing additional equity securities, this would have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. If we raise funds through the incurrence of debt, the risks we face with respect to our indebtedness would increase and we would incur additional interest expense.\nAdditionally, due to recent default rates in the oil and gas industry and other factors, some lenders have expressed a hesitancy to lend to oil and gas producers, and may require terms less favorable to the producers or, in some cases, may refuse to provide financing to the industry altogether. We anticipate that the number of lenders willing to participate in the lending syndicate under our revolving credit facility may decline in the future. Our inability to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms would adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and the cost of servicing, and risks related to refinancing, that debt could adversely affect our business. Those risks could increase if we incur more debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding. As a result, a significant portion of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowing capacity available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nServicing our indebtedness and satisfying our other obligations will require a significant amount of cash. Our cash flow from operating activities and other sources may not be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend on our future operating performance, our financial condition and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that sufficient future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, to fund our liquidity needs.\nA substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations, including by curtailing our exploration and drilling programs, reducing our capital expenditures, refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing. In addition, we might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate these dispositions for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which\ncould further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of our debt agreements could restrict us from implementing some of these alternatives.\nCovenants in our debt agreements currently impose, and future financing agreements may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions.\nOur current debt agreements contain restrictions, and future financing agreements may contain additional restrictions, on our activities, including covenants that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022make specified types of investments;\n\u2022apply net proceeds from certain asset sales;\n\u2022engage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022engage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022merge or consolidate;\n\u2022restrict dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell equity interests of restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or dispose of assets.\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties as well as a pledge of all ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries. The restrictions contained in our debt agreements may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that subject us to additional restrictive covenants.\nOur revolving credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and our ability to comply with those restrictions and covenants is uncertain. Our lenders can unilaterally reduce our borrowing availability based on anticipated commodity prices.\nWe expect to depend on our revolving credit facility for part of our future capital needs. Our ability to comply with covenants and restrictions in our credit agreement in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions and covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement, and cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable.\nThe revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from the properties securing their loan. Decreases in the price of crude oil, natural gas or NGLs can be expected to have an adverse effect on the borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately unless we pledge other crude oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the revolving credit facility. Our inability to borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, the resulting default could lead to an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and we may not have or be able to obtain the funds necessary to repay those amounts.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our revolving credit facility that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows and are otherwise unable to obtain the funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness.\nIn the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the default could result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders under our revolving credit facility to avoid being in default and we may not be able to obtain such a waiver. If this occurs and no waiver is obtained, we would be in default under our revolving credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to our debt agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may be adversely affected by the phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is in the process of assessing replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index (e.g. secured overnight financing rate). Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduced income from failure to perform by our counterparties, could limit our potential gains from increases in prices and could result in volatility in our net income.\nWe use commodity derivatives for a portion of the production from our own wells to achieve more predictable cash flows, to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, and to allow our natural gas marketing company to offer pricing options to natural gas sellers and purchasers. These arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when purchases or sales are different than expected or the counterparty to the commodity derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, many of our commodity derivative contracts are based on WTI or another crude oil or natural gas index price. The risk that the differential between the index price and the price we receive for the relevant production may change unexpectedly makes it more difficult to hedge effectively and increases the risk of a hedging-related loss. Also, commodity derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for the relevant commodity.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had hedged a total of 20.0 MMBbls crude oil and 120.5 MMBtu of natural gas for 2021 and 2022. These hedges may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in crude oil and natural gas prices.\nSince we do not designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges, we do not currently qualify for use of hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives are recorded in our income statements and our net income is subject to greater volatility than it would be if our commodity derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting. For instance, if commodity prices rise significantly, this could result in significant non-cash charges during the relevant period, which could have a material negative effect on our net income.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some liabilities or losses that we may incur.\nThe occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully covered by insurance, not properly or timely noticed to our carrier, or that is in excess of our insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable. The cost of obtaining insurance has increased as a result of the SRC Acquisition because of the increased size of our asset base.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Adverse events including changes in production volumes, worldwide demand and prices for crude oil and natural gas, regulatory developments, and changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. General market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of stocks generally could also have a similar negative impact. The stock markets regularly experience price and volume volatility that affects many companies\u2019 stock prices without regard to the operating performance of those companies. Volatility of this type may affect the trading price of our common stock. Similar factors could also affect the trading prices of our senior notes.", "PERMNO": 62341, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PDCE"}
