{"cik": "906192", "company": "SRA INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our Company. If any of the risks described below actually occurs, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur largest customer, the U.S. federal government, accounts for substantially all of our revenue and earnings. Inherent in the government contracting process are unique risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generated greater than 97% of our revenue from services provided on engagements with various agencies of the U.S. federal government in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. We expect to continue to derive most of our future revenues from the U.S. government. In this market, customer relationships involve certain unique risks that can impact our business and results of operations:\n\u2022\nA reduction in federal government spending or changes in spending policies or budget priorities may result from changes in U.S. government leadership, the number of and intensity of and strategy related to military conflicts, the size of the federal budget deficit, increasing political pressure to reduce overall levels of government spending, disruptions in the U.S. Treasury bond markets, shifts in spending priorities as a result of competing demands for federal funds, in-sourcing efforts aimed at improving the organic capabilities of the federal government, or other factors.\n\u2022\nThe failure by Congress to pass the annual budget on a timely basis may delay funding for customers who are expected to pay for work we are already performing and may also result in any new initiatives being delayed, and potentially canceled. Further, a failure to pass a budget or continuing resolution may result in a federal government shutdown such as the one that occurred in October 2013. Revenue for fiscal 2014 was negatively impacted by the government shutdown in October 2013 by approximately $12 million.\n\u2022\nThe amount of U.S. federal government debt is limited by statute, and this limit, referred to as the debt ceiling, can only be raised by an act of Congress. If Congress does not act timely to raise the debt ceiling when necessary, federal government spending would be subject to reduction, suspension or cancellation.\n\u2022\nAlthough the OMB has issued guidance on the implementation of sequestration, the impact spending cuts will have on contractors supporting the U.S. federal government remains uncertain. Budget cuts or automatic spending cuts on our business and the reaction of federal agencies to budgetary constraints and related concerns will continue to place downward pressure on government spending levels that may reduce, delay or cancel funding for certain of our contracts and programs. On February 2, 2015, President Obama released his budget proposal for government fiscal year 2016, which would eliminate the sequester for government fiscal year 2016 and future\nyears through a series of ten-year offsets that include trimming programs and raising tax revenues. It is unclear whether Congress will enact the President\u2019s proposal, but if so, spending cuts as part of this plan may reduce, delay, or cancel funding for certain of our contracts.\n\u2022\nFederal government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. Congress generally appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time. The government generally has the unilateral right to reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts, or decline to exercise an option to renew a multi-year contract. A decision by our customers not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts for convenience could result in significant shortfalls compared to anticipated revenues from these customers.\n\u2022\nWe generally encounter intense competition to win federal government contracts and spend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us. We win a limited percentage of the contracts we bid for. We may need to expend resources, make financial commitments (such as procuring leased premises), and bid on engagements in advance of the completion of the design of our technologies, which may result in unforeseen difficulties in execution, cost overruns, and the loss of committed costs. Increased competition in the industry may cause some of the services we provide to become \u201ccommoditized\u201d and more competitively priced and less profitable. For example, we were unsuccessful in our bid on a recompete of work performed for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, in 2012, which was our largest contract at that time.\n\u2022\nMany federal government contract award decisions are commonly subject to protest by competitors, which may statutorily require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest and may also result in a requirement to resubmit bids for a previously awarded contract or in the termination, reduction, or modification of an awarded contract.\n\u2022\nGovernment regulations on organizational conflicts of interest may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain contracts. The government could determine that an organizational conflict of interest or other conflict of interest, such as a personal conflict of interest, exists. If a conflict is perceived or exists we may be deemed unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government. As a result, we may be ineligible to compete for any such related contracts as we could be perceived as having an unfair competitive advantage.\n\u2022\nMany government contracts require that our employees maintain various levels of security clearances and that we have certain facility security clearances, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. To the extent we are not able to obtain facility clearances, engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract, or maintain connections to controlled government information systems, we may not be able to bid or win new contracts, or effectively re-compete on expiring contracts.\n\u2022\nFederal government contracts generally allow the government to terminate a contract, with short or no prior notice, for convenience, as well as for default in the event we fail to meet contractual obligations. If a government customer terminates one of our contracts for convenience, we would generally be able to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the government. A termination for default could expose us to liability for the customer\u2019s costs of re-procurement, damage our reputation, and impair our ability to compete for future contracts.\n\u2022\nFederal government contracts contain certain provisions that are unfavorable to us and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government certain rights and remedies, some of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. Our federal customers may cancel pending solicitations, decline to exercise options on existing contracts, or determine not to allot additional funding to cost-reimbursement contracts despite the fact that we may have incurred costs related to pursuing a particular opportunity. The government may also reduce contract scope pursuant to the FAR \u201cChanges\u201d clause, cancel multi-year contracts if funds are not available for contract performance for a subsequent program year, suspend or delay performance, issue stop work orders, opt not to purchase more than the minimum under an ID/IQ contract, terminate contracts for the government\u2019s\nconvenience, or not renew programs. With fewer federal funds available, issues once resolved as routine contract administration matters (e.g., requests for equitable adjustments, change orders, economic price adjustments, delay claims, etc.) may increasingly lead to more litigation. Extensive contract terminations or contract scope reductions could require us to layoff employees and incur significant severance, relocation and facility closing costs, reducing our revenues and margins.\n\u2022\nIn connection with the Small Business Administration, or SBA, set-aside program, the government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify as small, small-disadvantaged, minority-owned businesses, or other such programs. As a result, we would not be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those programs and would be restricted to a minority ownership interest and a maximum of 49% of the work as a subcontractor on such programs. An increase in the amount of procurements under the set-aside program may affect our ability to bid on new procurements as a prime contractor, or restrict our eligibility to compete on incumbent work that is set aside for small businesses.\n\u2022\nThe U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time. Our industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies, and recovery of costs, among other items. U.S. government agencies may limit the creation of new government-wide or agency-specific multiple award contracts, and may also face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability, as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of U.S. government agencies, such as increased usage of fixed-price contracts, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could alter our contract mix unfavorably or impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are recompeted. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods established by the government could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the full value of our backlog, which may result in lower than expected revenue.\nAs of June 30, 2015, our total backlog was $3.4 billion, of which $643.7 million was funded. We define backlog to include the following two components:\n\u2022\nFunded Backlog. Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized, less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.\n\u2022\nUnfunded Backlog. Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized.\nBacklog includes all contract options that have been priced but not yet funded, and includes an estimate of the contract value under single award ID/IQ contracts against which we expect future task orders to be issued without competition. Backlog does not include any value for the ceiling of multiple award contracts, nor does it include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under multiple award ID/IQ vehicles, GWACs, or General Services Administration, or GSA, schedule contracts.\nWe historically have not realized all of the revenue included in our total backlog, and we may not realize all of the revenue included in our total backlog in the future. There is a somewhat higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and priced options. In addition, there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period. This is because the actual receipt, timing, and amount of revenue under contracts included in backlog are subject to various contingencies many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to realize revenue on our backlog, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may earn less revenue than projected, or no revenue, under certain of our contracts.\nMany of our contracts with our customers are ID/IQ contracts, including GSA schedules and GWACs. ID/IQ contracts provide for the issuance by the customer of orders for services or products under the contract, and often contain multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, which allow but do not commit the U.S. government to purchase products and services from contractors. Our ability to generate revenue under each of these types of contracts depends upon our ability to be awarded task orders for specific services by the customer. ID/IQ contracts may be awarded to one contractor (single award) or several contractors (multiple award). Multiple contractors must compete under multiple award ID/IQ contracts for task orders to provide particular services, and contractors earn revenue only to the extent that they successfully compete and be awarded these task orders. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our revenue under our GSA schedules and GWACs, including single-award ID/IQ contracts, accounted for 56%, 62%, and 66%, respectively, of our total revenue. A failure to be awarded task orders under such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes pursuing both organic growth opportunities and strategic acquisitions.\nOur long-term business strategy depends in part on increasing our market share through investing in our business development capabilities and pursuing strategic acquisitions. If we are unable to win additional business due to competition from incumbent providers or otherwise or if we fail to identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on appropriate terms, our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may spend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us. In addition, acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired personnel and corporate cultures into our business, and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations.\nWe have a recent history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe incurred losses from continuing operations of $317.3 million, $24.2 million and $11.9 million in fiscal 2013, 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively. In addition, we may incur additional losses from continuing operations in the future. Continued losses would reduce our cash available from operations to service our indebtedness, as well as limit our ability to finance our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, which could require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats, attacks and other disruptions.\nLike others in our industry, we continue to face advanced and persistent attacks on our IT infrastructure where we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive/confidential data relating to our operations. These attacks may include sophisticated malware (viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs) and phishing emails that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. These intrusions sometimes may be zero-day malware that are difficult to identify because they are not included in the signature set of commercially available antivirus scanning programs. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our customers or other third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns that we are unable to thwart. Additionally, sophisticated software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the information infrastructure. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated.\nWe are subject to laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, and security of user data and are subject to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify customers or employees of a data security breach. Persistent cybersecurity threats and attacks on our IT infrastructure require significant management attention and resources and may expose sensitive personally identifiable and other critical information of our customers, their employees or our own employees,\nand other parties with whom we conduct business and a loss or misuse of this information, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-attack could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and may impede critical functions. Occurrence of any of these security threats could adversely affect our reputation, ability to work on sensitive U.S. government contracts, business operations and financial results. Given the nature of our work for the federal government, we have been subject to attempted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may again in the future.\nThe current competitive landscape and budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may be larger with greater financial resources and technical staffs or smaller with more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities that are able to concentrate their resources in particular areas. Additionally, we also compete with the U.S. government\u2019s own internal capabilities. Our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address the changing needs of the customer and provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. Additionally, our ability to implement solutions for our customers incorporating new developments and improvements in technology are important to our success. Multi-award contracts require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders under the contract.\nThe competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors. Following an award, we may encounter significant expenses, delays, contract modifications, or even loss of the contract if our competitors protest or challenge contracts that are awarded to us.\nIf we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process, in addition to the risk that our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, we may also be unable to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years.\nIf the systems that we install fail or have significant delays or errors, or products or services we supply have defects, we may be liable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation.\nMany of the systems we develop, install, and maintain involve managing and protecting information used in intelligence, national security, and other sensitive or classified government functions. Some of our contracts provide critical products and services related to aviation, other transportation systems, space communications and other important civil and government functions having potential for significant economic or personal liabilities. Damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of these systems or other failure could materially reduce our revenue.\nIf our solutions, services, products or other applications have defects or errors, are subject to delivery delays or fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, we may:\n\u2022\nExperience a loss of revenues due to adverse customer reaction or contract termination;\n\u2022\nBe required to provide additional services to a customer at no charge or pay re-procurement costs;\n\u2022\nReceive negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers;\n\u2022\nSuffer claims for substantial damages against us; and\n\u2022\nFace material claims for damage to personal property and injuries including loss of life.\nIn addition to any costs resulting from product warranties, contract performance or required corrective action, these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenues if they result in customers postponing subsequently scheduled work, canceling contracts or failing to renew contracts. We may have agreed to indemnify our customers fully for damages and third-party claims, we may have failed to obtain adequate contractual limitations of liability, and we may be found liable for material direct, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages. If we are required to respond to such indemnification obligations, it may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInternal or external system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers.\nA system or service disruption, including those caused by ongoing efforts to improve our IT systems and the delivery of services whether through us or through an outsourced service, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Customer system failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Many of the systems and networks that we develop, install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government information. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions, if a system or network that we develop, install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, unauthorized intruders, hackers, computer viruses or other cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, or other events, we may experience loss of revenue, remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination. Any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks.\nOur failure to comply with complex laws and regulations could cause us to lose business and subject us to a variety of penalties.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts, which affect how we do business with our government customers and may impose added costs on our business. These laws and regulations are related to, for example, procurement integrity, disclosure of cost and pricing data, allowability of costs, national security, and employment practices. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, loss of security clearances, forfeiture of profits, harm to our reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the federal government. Among the most significant of these regulations are:\n\u2022\nthe FAR and supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations, modifications, and task orders;\n\u2022\nthe Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials;\n\u2022\nthe False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which provide for substantial civil and criminal penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval, and for making false statements to the U.S. government, respectively;\n\u2022\nU.S. government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts, including allowable amounts for executive compensation reimbursement;\n\u2022\npost-government employment laws and regulations, which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit, hire, and deploy former employees of the U.S. government; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services, and technical data, including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work.\nOur employees might engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with federal government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, seeking reimbursement for improper expenses or falsifying time records. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our customers\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. The precautions we take to prevent and detect employee misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, which could harm our business.\nUnfavorable government audit results could force us to adjust previously reported operating results and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions which may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Inspectors General for various agencies with which we contract in the ordinary course of business. These agencies review, among other things, a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure, pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards, including U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards. They also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, cost accounting, labor, billing, compensation, labor category qualifications, other management information systems and indirect rates and pricing practices. A finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews may result in reduced billing rates to our U.S. government customers and withholding of payments on receivables until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediation is accepted by Defense Contract Management Agency, and could also impact the Company\u2019s ability to receive future cost type contract awards. Both contractors and the U.S. government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which the Company is held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. If our accounting systems are deemed inadequate we may be prevented from performing on current contracts which require systems that comply with Cost Accounting Standards or might be limited in the type of contract we are eligible to bid and perform on until such time as our systems are deemed adequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur indirect cost audits by the Defense Contract Audit Agency have not been completed for fiscal 2009 and subsequent fiscal years. Any costs found to be improperly charged or allocated to a government contract or not properly supported with sufficient documentation will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. We maintain reserves based on historical experience for incurred cost audits pending completion. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, unilateral reductions of our fees, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with U.S. government agencies.\nThe Company\u2019s income tax returns are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and its fiscal 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under audit.\nOur income tax returns are subject to review and audit in the United States and other jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more-likely-than-not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our tax positions, our effective tax rate on our earnings could increase substantially, and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPeriods for fiscal years ended after July 1, 2010 generally remain subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities. In foreign jurisdictions, tax years after 2010 may remain subject to examination by tax authorities. Our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 is currently under audit by the IRS. We have been notified that the IRS may contest a deduction in that period, but we believe firmly in the validity of our position and would defend it vigorously. Nonetheless, if the IRS were to challenge our prior tax positions and we are unsuccessful in defending them, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and/or be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have contracts with the U.S. government that are classified, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. government that are subject to security restrictions (classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these programs, any risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business.\nIf we cannot collect our receivables or if payment is delayed, our business may be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash flow, provide working capital, or continue our business operations.\nWe depend on the timely collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, and continue our business operations. If the U.S. government or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of invoices for any reason, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. The U.S. government may delay or fail to pay invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds, congressional failure to increase the federal government\u2019s debt ceiling which permits federal government expenditures, lack of an approved budget, or as a result of audit findings by government regulatory agencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly fewer financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or that payment may be delayed. If we are not paid for a substantial portion of the services we provide in such subcontracting arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe use estimates in recognizing revenue and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenue, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nRevenue from our fixed-price contracts is primarily recognized using the percentage-of-completion method with progress toward completion of a particular contract based on actual costs incurred relative to total estimated costs to be incurred over the life of the contract. Revenue from our cost-reimbursable-plus-award-fee contracts are based on our estimation of award fees over the life of the contract. Estimating costs at completion and award fees on our long-term contracts is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained, and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known.\nIn the event updated estimates indicate that we will experience a loss on the contract, we recognize the estimated loss at the time it is determined. Additional information may subsequently indicate that the loss is more or less than initially recognized, which requires further adjustments in our audited consolidated financial statements. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates could result in adjustments that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Failure to timely meet contractual requirements under fixed-price contracts or that contain a fixed-price component may result in additional costs to satisfy obligations to our customers, reductions in profit, payment of damages or penalties, or termination of the contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.\nTo facilitate our ability to prepare bids for new business, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide industry input and suggestions to government entities and agencies prior to the development of a formal bid. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities and agencies, and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for new business and could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nWe depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and the other companies will help us to win and perform the contract. Our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors fail to perform, perform poorly or eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us due to industry consolidations or otherwise, or if the U.S. government terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. Companies that do not have access to U.S. government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies\u2019 prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts.\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel or the subcontractor\u2019s misconduct or failure to comply with applicable law. Similarly, in instances where we serve as a subcontractor to another prime contractor, we may have disputes regarding that contractor\u2019s management of our subcontract, possible attempts to hire our personnel, or its failure to comply with applicable law. Uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors, which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders, especially if the customer is an agency of the U.S. government.\nOur cost-plus, time-and-material and fixed-price type contracts present certain risks to our business.\nOur business is transacted and revenue recognized through written revenue arrangements, or contracts, which are generally cost-plus, time-and-material, or fixed-price. Each of our contract types presents certain risks to our business as highlighted below.\nOn a cost-plus type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract\u2019s fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. Cost-plus type contracts with award fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees, which provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria, may result in risk to our business if we are unable to satisfy the relevant performance criteria.\nOn a time-and-material type contract (revenue arrangement), we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Time-and-material contracts may result in risk to our business if we fail to accurately estimate or otherwise recover expenses, including wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses.\nOn a fixed-price type service contract (revenue arrangement), we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. This may result in greater risk to our business that we may not be reimbursed for services rendered than under a cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts where we generally do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.\nOur overall profit margins on our contracts may decrease and our results of operations could be adversely affected if materials and subcontract revenues grow at a faster rate than labor-related revenues.\nOur revenues are generated both from the efforts of our employees (labor-related revenues) and from the receipt of payments for the cost of materials and subcontracts we use in connection with performing our services (materials and subcontract revenues). Generally, our materials and subcontract revenues have lower profit margins than our labor-related revenues. If our materials and subcontract revenues grow at a faster rate than labor-related revenues, our overall profit margins may decrease and our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified employees, we might not be able to staff recently awarded contracts and sustain our profit margins and revenue growth.\nAs an advanced IT and technical services company, our business is labor intensive, and, therefore, our ability to attract and retain highly qualified individuals who work well with our customers in a government environment is an important factor in determining our success. Some of our government contracts require us to employ individuals who have particular security clearances issued by the DoD or other government agencies.\nDepending on the level of required clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees, our ability to staff recently awarded contracts and to maintain and grow our business could be limited. We are operating in a tight labor market for cleared personnel and, if it continues to tighten, we could be required to engage larger numbers of subcontractor personnel, which could cause our profit margins to suffer.\nIn addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and its ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Personal reputations and individual business relationships are critical elements of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities.\nIf we fail to manage acquisitions successfully, our revenue and operating results may be impaired.\nPart of our growth strategy includes pursuing acquisitions. Identification and valuation of acquisition targets and closing complicated transactions involve significant risks to our business. In pricing acquisitions, we may make overly optimistic assumptions of future business growth. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential liabilities of a particular acquisition. We may encounter increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase the price of our acquisitions. Additionally, these transactions often require substantial management resources and may divert our attention away from day-to-day operations.\nIntegrating acquired operations of the acquisitions we choose to complete is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully. Failure to retain key employees and successfully integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our cost structure thereby reducing our margins and return on investment. Acquisitions may involve incurrence of additional indebtedness which may constrain further growth and include restrictive financial covenants that, if not complied with, may lead to default. We may have difficulty integrating accounting, information management, or other control systems and technologies, particularly with respect to those that are still in development when acquired. Additionally, we may fail to discover material liabilities during the due diligence process, including the failure of prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees to comply with applicable laws or regulations or their failure to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers. Acquisitions may also increase organizational conflicts of interest, impacting current business and limiting further growth.\nIn addition, we periodically divest businesses or contracts, including those that are no longer part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources and may result in losses on the sale of the business. Additionally, as a part of a transaction, it is customary to agree to certain indemnification obligations related to the divestiture. The indemnification period generally expires one to two years after the transaction date; however fraud and tax indemnifications last longer. If claims or other costs are incurred related to the divestiture, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe have very limited ability to protect our intellectual property, which is important to our success. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position. In conducting our business, we may infringe the rights of others.\nWe rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property where patent protection is not feasible and/or copyright protection is not appropriate. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Confidentiality agreements may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. Moreover, use of our trade secrets in performing contracts with the U.S. government can result in the government obtaining license rights in these trade secrets. We have a limited patent portfolio in the United States and Europe and in some cases our intellectual property rights may be limited to only the United States and certain other jurisdictions.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we might inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. Defending these claims may be costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe attempt to obtain adequate insurance to mitigate many of our significant risks and liabilities. Not every risk or liability can be protected against by insurance, and for insurable risks, the limits of coverage reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses incurred. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us, or at all, our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations could be disrupted. Securing more coverage may impact profitability. Because of the limitations in overall available coverage or our business decisions regarding the amount of coverage that we choose to secure, we may have to bear substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are a defendant in pending litigation and may be subject to future litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to investigations, audits and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to agencies and departments of the U.S. government, state, local and foreign governments, and otherwise in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. Such matters can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, can cause us to be faced with penalties, fines, repayments or compensatory damages, and can lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. Adverse findings could also have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts.\nWe are also involved in, and may in the future become a party to, various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business including but not limited to various employment litigation matters and investigations or charges before administrative agencies. We can give no assurance that the outcome of any such matter would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any claims or litigation may be costly to defend. Even if we are successful or fully indemnified or insured, such claims and litigation could damage our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. We are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes or the actual impact of these matters on our profitability. If we agree to settle these matters or judgments are secured against us, we may incur charges which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in future economic or business conditions could cause recorded goodwill or other intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in material losses and write-downs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets accounted for approximately 75% of our recorded total assets in fiscal 2015. Goodwill is allocated to each of our business groups and each group is evaluated separately for impairment annually as of April 1, or more frequently when evidence of potential impairment exists. Trade names are also tested for impairment annually as of April 1, or more frequently when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment tests are based on many inputs requiring judgment. Given the current industry conditions and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and trade names impairment analyses will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability are not achieved, or we experience adverse changes in market factors such as discount rates or valuation multiplies derived from comparable publicly traded companies, we may be required to recognize goodwill or trade names impairment charges in future periods.\nFor a discussion of the impairment analysis for fiscal 2015 and 2014, refer to Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur indirect parent, SRA Companies, Inc., has filed a registration statement with the SEC for a potential initial public offering. Fulfilling the obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, will be expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nOur indirect parent, SRA Companies, Inc., has filed a registration statement with the SEC for a potential initial public offering. Should the offering be completed, SRA Companies, Inc. will be subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements, stock exchange listing standards and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that apply to issuers of listed equity, which will impose certain new compliance costs and obligations upon us. The changes necessitated by publicly listing SRA Companies\u2019 equity will require a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight which will increase our operating costs. These changes will also place additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nRisks Related to our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of June 30, 2015, we had approximately $1,064.2 million of senior indebtedness comprised of $664.2 million on our senior secured Term Loan B Facility (as described herein) and $400.0 million of the Senior Notes (as described herein). In addition, we have approximately $100.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Existing Revolver (as described herein). Together the Existing Revolver and the Term Loan B Facility are referred to as the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due, in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial debt could also have other significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes on satisfactory terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nrequire us to utilize a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability or increase the costs to refinance indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can enter into such transactions, as well as the volume of those transactions; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nOur ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and service our debt and financial obligations and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation depends on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt and/or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these potential remedies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or otherwise be available. In addition, the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreement governing the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities may limit the availability or effectiveness of certain remedies, including the use of proceeds from divested assets. In the absence of sufficient operating results and/or limitations on remedies available to us, we could face substantial liquidity problems.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We manage our exposure to interest rate movements through the use of interest rate swap agreements. As of June 30, 2015, we had hedged the interest rate on $500.0 million of our outstanding Term Loan B Facility through the use of such interest rate swap agreements. The interest rate on the remaining $164.2 million of our outstanding Term Loan B Facility was unhedged. In the future, we may enter into similar interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce future interest rate volatility. However, due to risks for hedging gains and losses and cash settlement costs, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR over the 1.25% floor could increase our annual interest expense and related cash flows by approximately $1.6 million based on the unhedged portion of the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities outstanding as of June 30, 2015.\nRestrictive covenants in the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our Senior Notes may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. These agreements governing our indebtedness include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\npay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including acquisitions, loans, advances or guarantees;\n\u2022\nprepay the Senior Notes and certain subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\namend material agreements governing the Senior Notes and certain subordinated indebtedness.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum net senior secured leverage ratio.\nA breach of any covenant contained in either the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Senior Notes could result in a default under those agreements. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the holders of the Senior Notes, as the case may be, may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes would cause a default under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the acceleration of debt under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the failure to pay that debt when due would cause a default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes (assuming the amount of that debt is in excess of $25.0 million). The lenders under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Further, following an event of default under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders under these facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which includes the available cash of our subsidiaries that guarantee the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If the debt under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the Senior Notes becomes due and payable, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.\nThe interests of our indirect parent, SRA Companies, Inc., and its controlling stockholders may differ from the interests of the holders of our debt.\nThe interests of our indirect parent, SRA Companies, Inc., and/or its controlling stockholders, Providence and Dr. Volgenau, may differ from the holders of our debt in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of SRA Companies, Inc. and/or its controlling stockholders might conflict with the interests of a debt holder. The Controlling Stockholders may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a debt holder.\nProvidence is in the business of making investments in companies, and may from time to time in the future, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. You should consider that the interests of these holders may differ from the holders of our debt in material respects. In addition, to the extent that Providence or its affiliates own or acquire a material or substantial interest in one or more companies that provide services or products to the U.S. government, our affiliation with any such company through Providence could create organizational conflicts of interest and similar issues for us under federal procurement laws and regulations.", "PERMNO": 89410, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SRX"}
