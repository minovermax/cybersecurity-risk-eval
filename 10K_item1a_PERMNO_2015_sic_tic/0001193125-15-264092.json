{"cik": "110621", "company": "RPM INTERNATIONAL INC/DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us, our business and your investment in us.\nWe are the subject of an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial condition and results of operations.\nWe were notified by the SEC on June 24, 2014 that we are the subject of a formal investigation pertaining to the timing of our disclosure and accrual of loss reserves in fiscal 2013 with respect to the previously disclosed GSA and DOJ investigation into compliance issues relating to Tremco Roofing Division\u2019s GSA contracts. We are cooperating with the SEC in its ongoing investigation and continue to be engaged in discussions with the staff of the Division of Enforcement concerning potential issues arising out of the SEC\u2019s investigation. As previously disclosed, our audit committee completed an investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the timing of our disclosure and accrual of loss reserves with respect to the GSA and DOJ investigations, and determined to restate our financial results for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2013.\nWe have incurred significant legal and accounting expenditures in connection with the SEC\u2019s investigation. We are unable to predict how long the SEC\u2019s investigation will continue or whether, at the conclusion of its\ninvestigation, the SEC will seek to impose fines or take other actions against us. Any action by the SEC could result in sanctions against us and/or certain of our officers. A protracted investigation could impose substantial additional costs and distractions, regardless of its outcome. Furthermore, publicity surrounding the foregoing or any enforcement action as a result of the SEC\u2019s investigation, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations have been adversely affected by global market and economic conditions.\nGlobal economic uncertainty continues to exist. Our operations could be adversely affected by global economic conditions if global markets were to decline in the future. Any future economic declines may result in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collection of customer receivables. We also have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased competitive pricing pressure. In addition, customer difficulties in the future could result in decreases in product demand, increases in bad debt write-offs, decreases in timely collection of accounts receivable and adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.\nGlobal economic and capital market conditions may cause our access to capital to be more difficult in the future and/or costs to secure such capital more expensive.\nWe may need new or additional financing in the future to provide liquidity to conduct our operations, expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. Any sustained weakness in general economic conditions and/or U.S. or global capital markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. From time to time we have relied, and we may also rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Our access to funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. Longer term volatility and continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.\nVolatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions.\nWe sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans and various other nonqualified postretirement plans. The qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities and other investments. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future contribution requirements. A significant decrease in investment returns or the market value of plan assets or a significant decrease in interest rates could increase our net periodic pension costs and adversely affect our results of operations. A significant increase in our contribution requirements with respect to our qualified defined benefit pension plans could have an adverse impact on our cash flow.\nThe results of our annual testing of goodwill and other intangible assets have required, and in the future may require that we incur non-cash impairment charges.\nAs of May 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.8 billion in goodwill and other intangible assets. The Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) section 350 requires that goodwill be tested at least on an annual basis, or more frequently as impairment indicators arise, using either a qualitative assessment or a fair-value\napproach at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual required impairment tests, which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the reporting units with which goodwill is associated, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter. The evaluation of our long-lived assets for impairment includes determining whether indicators of impairment exist, which is a subjective process that takes into account both internal and external factors. Impairment assessment requires the use of significant judgment with regard to estimates and assumptions surrounding future results of operations and cash flows. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our impairment testing did not result in any impairment loss. In the future, if global economic conditions were to decline significantly, or if our reporting units experienced significant declines in business, we may incur substantial non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. The amount of any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur significant amount of indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur total debt levels were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion at May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which compares with $1.3 billion in stockholders\u2019 equity at May 31, 2015. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, stock repurchases or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nresult in a downgrade of our credit rating, which would increase our borrowing costs, adversely affect our financial results, and make it more difficult for us to raise capital;\n\u2022\nrestrict our operational flexibility and reduce our ability to conduct certain transactions, since our credit facility contains certain restrictive financial and operating covenants;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions, which would make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nhave a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity if large debt maturities occur in close succession.\nWe cannot assure you that our business always will be able to make timely or sufficient payments of our debt. Should we fail to comply with covenants in our debt instruments, such failure could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nFluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe obtain the raw materials needed to manufacture our products from a number of suppliers. Many of our raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives, minerals and metals. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available on the open market and from a variety of producers. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials or increase the cost of manufacturing our products. Although certain petroleum-based raw materials have eased lately, the costs of the raw materials we use are under generally upward pressure, over the longer term, due to escalating energy and related feedstock costs, increased levels of global demand, and improved levels of supplier pricing discipline. If the prices of raw materials continue to increase and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, we could experience reduced gross profit margins.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and some of our competitors are much larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do.\nThe markets in which we operate are fragmented, and we do not face competition from any one company across all of our product lines. However, any significant increase in competition, as a result of the consolidation of competitors or otherwise, may cause us to lose market share or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced gross profit margins. Increased competition may also impair our\nability to grow or to maintain our current levels of revenues and earnings. Companies that compete in our markets include Akzo Nobel, Ferro, H.B. Fuller, Masco, PPG, Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. Several of these companies are much larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do. Increased competition with these companies could prevent the institution of price increases or could require price reductions or increased spending to maintain our market share, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.\nWe depend on a number of large customers for a significant portion of our net sales and, therefore, significant declines in the level of purchases by any of these key customers could harm our business.\nSome of our operating companies, particularly in the consumer segment, face a substantial amount of customer concentration. Our key consumer segment customers include Ace Hardware, Canadian Tire, Cotter & Company, Do It Best, The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Menards, Orgill, Wal-Mart and W.W. Grainger. Sales to our ten largest consumer segment customers accounted for approximately 23%, 24% and 22% of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and 67%, 64% and 63%, respectively, of the consumer segment\u2019s net sales for those same fiscal years. Sales to the Home Depot represented less than 10% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013; 11% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 and 10% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015; and 29%, 29% and 28% of our consumer segment net sales for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. If we were to lose one or more of our key customers, or experience a delay or cancellation of a significant order, or incur a significant decrease in the level of purchases from any of our key customers, or experience difficulty in collecting amounts due from a key customer, our net revenues could decline materially and our operating results could be reduced materially.\nMany of our customers operate in cyclical industries, and downward economic cycles may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our customers, across both reportable segments, are in businesses and industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, interest rates, construction activity, and other factors, including changes in consumer spending and preferences. As a result, the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, upon general economic conditions. Downward economic cycles affecting the markets of our customers may reduce the sales of our products resulting in material reductions to our revenues and net earnings.\nA loss in the actual or perceived value of our brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products.\nOur family of products includes a number of well-known brand names that are used in a variety of construction, industrial maintenance, consumer DIY and professional applications. We believe that continuing to maintain the strength of our brands is critical to increasing demand for our products and maintaining their widespread acceptance among our customers. The reputations of our branded products depend on numerous factors, including the successful advertising and marketing of our brand names, consumer acceptance, the availability of similar products from our competitors, and our ability to maintain our products\u2019 quality and technological advantages. A loss in the actual or perceived value of our brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material trademarks and other proprietary information.\nWe have numerous valuable patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks and trade names, including certain marks that are significant to our business, which are identified under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Despite our efforts to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, other parties, including our former employees or consultants, may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our proprietary information or marks without our authorization. Unauthorized use of our trademarks, or unauthorized use or disclosure of our other intellectual property, could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nThe chemical and construction products industries in which we operate expose us to inherent risks of legal and warranty claims and other litigation-related costs, which could adversely impact our business.\nAs a participant in the chemical and construction products industries, we face an inherent risk of exposure to legal claims in the event that the failure, use or misuse of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. In the course of our business we are subject to a variety of inquiries and investigations by regulators, as well as claims and lawsuits by private parties including those related to product liability, asbestos, product warranty, environmental, contracts, intellectual property and commercial matters, which due to their uncertain nature may result in losses, some of which may be material. We offer warranties on many of our products, as well as long term warranty programs at certain of our businesses, and as a result, from time to time we may experience higher levels of warranty expense, which is typically reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. The nature and extent to which we use hazardous or flammable materials in our manufacturing processes creates risk of damage to persons and property that, if realized, could be material.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to unforeseen future expenditures or liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada and other countries where we conduct business. Governmental and regulatory authorities impose various laws and regulations on us that relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters, including the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of solid and hazardous wastes, the use of certain chemicals in product formulations, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, TSCA, and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes. In addition, these laws and regulations often impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up our or our predecessors\u2019 past or present facilities and third party disposal sites. We are currently undertaking remedial activities at a number of facilities and properties and have received notices under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) or analogous state laws of liability or potential liability in connection with the disposal of material from our current or former operations. Further, we also could be subject to future liability resulting from conditions that are currently unknown to us that could be discovered in the future.\nThe environmental laws under which we operate are numerous, complicated and often increasingly stringent, and may be applied retroactively. As a result, we have not always been and may not always be in full compliance with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which we conduct our business. In addition, if we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We also could be liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances relating to our products or operations. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nOur businesses are dependent on the issuance of operating permits and registrations required from government agencies. In connection with the performance of certain activities, our businesses are required to seek permission from agencies in the states, provinces, and countries in which they operate. If regulatory permits or registrations are delayed, restricted, or rejected, subsequent operations at our businesses could be delayed or restricted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect that the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business will continue to become more stringent in the future which may result in increased costs to us for compliance therewith. Further, failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit requirements could result in substantial civil or criminal fines and penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations, remedial or corrective measures, installations of pollution control equipment, or other actions. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur businesses are subject to varying domestic and foreign laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nOur businesses are subject to varying domestic and foreign laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. These include securities, environmental, tax, competition and anti-trust, trade controls, data security, employment and privacy laws and regulations. These laws and regulations change from time to time and thus may result in increased costs to us related to our compliance therewith. From time to time regulators review our compliance with applicable laws. Enforcement actions, fines and private litigation claims and damages occur, notwithstanding our belief that we have in place appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks.\nWe from time-to-time experience compliance issues in foreign jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, we experience compliance issues and are the subject of governmental investigations in foreign jurisdictions. Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Should it be determined that any of our foreign subsidiaries or its employees have violated applicable law, it could be subject to legal penalties and its and our business reputation could be damaged.\nIf our efforts in acquiring and integrating other companies or product lines or establishing joint ventures fail, our business may not grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and creating joint ventures. Our ability to continue to grow in this manner depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. In addition, acquisitions and their subsequent integration involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessments of disclosed liabilities and the potentially adverse effects of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, their products, and their culture into our existing business;\n\u2022\nunforeseen delays in realizing the benefits from acquired companies or product lines, including projected efficiencies, cost savings, revenue synergies and profit margins;\n\u2022\nunforeseen diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business matters;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties resulting from insufficient prior experience in any new markets we may enter;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in retaining key employees and customers of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nincreases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could in turn restrict our ability to raise additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy.\nExecution of our acquisition strategy with respect to some companies or product lines could fail or could result in unanticipated costs to us that were not apparent despite our due diligence efforts, either of which could hinder our growth or adversely impact our results of operations.\nEach of our credit facilities and indentures contain restrictions on certain mergers and asset dispositions.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from foreign markets, which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur foreign manufacturing operations accounted for approximately 38% of our net trade sales for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015, not including exports directly from the U.S. which accounted for approximately 2% of our net trade sales for fiscal 2015. We plan to continue to grow our international operations and the growth and maintenance of such operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, inflation rates, trade protection measures, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, changing intellectual property rights, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of our products or increase our costs. Also, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in material volatility in our costs and earnings and may also adversely affect the carrying values of our assets located outside the U.S.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries, as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of Foreign Assets Control and the Department of Commerce.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to governmental officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or for other unfair advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Although we have internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent a violation of these laws.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. regulations on trade sanctions and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the Commerce Department and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, which are complex and constantly changing. A violation thereof could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and significant civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nViolations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to the effect of global tax law changes, some of which have been, and may be in the future, retroactive in application.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations which govern, among other things, taxes on worldwide income. Any potential tax law changes may, for example, increase applicable tax rates, have retroactive application, or impose stricter compliance requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could reduce our consolidated net earnings.\nIn response to, for instance, an economic crisis or recession, governments may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us, including modifications that could, for example, reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured. If changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase, our profits could be reduced, and if such increases were a result of our status as a U.S. company, could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.\nFurther, legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. which, if ultimately enacted, could subject us to increased taxes which could adversely affect our effective tax rate.\nWe cannot predict the outcome or timing of any specific legislative, regulatory or other tax proposals or changes.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure to comply with federal, state and local government procurement regulations and requirements.\nWe have contracts with federal, state and local governmental entities, and are required to comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements relating to those contracts. We also enter into subcontracts with other federal, state, or local prime contractors. Further, we may serve as a supplier to an entity that is a federal, state, or local prime or subcontractor. Requirements in our contracts and those requirements flowed down to us in our capacity as a subcontractor or supplier, although customary in government contracts, may impact our performance and compliance costs. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements or to make required disclosures under contract could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination for cause, adverse past performance ratings, actions under a federal or state false claims statute, suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and the assessment of penalties and fines, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.\nTerrorist activities and other acts of violence or war, natural disasters and other disruptions have negatively impacted in the past and could negatively impact in the future the U.S. and foreign countries, the financial markets, the industries in which we compete, our operations and profitability.\nTerrorist activities and natural disasters have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence, war or natural disasters could affect the industries in which we compete, our ability to purchase raw materials, our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, terrorist activities and natural disasters may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, which could impact our sales, our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers. Disruptions could also occur due to cyber-attacks, computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error or process failures. Any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nData privacy and data security considerations could impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nDespite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data and comply with and implement data security measures, our facilities, and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss, including cyber-attacks and, in fact, we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results. In addition, it is not possible to predict the impact of the future loss,\nalteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us, our employees, former employees, customers or suppliers. This could lead to negative publicity, legal claims, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes, operational disruptions and other significant costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we have insurance, it may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations.\nAlthough we maintain insurance of various types to cover many of the risks and hazards that apply to our operations, our insurance may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.\nAdverse weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales.\nFrom time to time, adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the U.S. and other countries in which we do business have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint, coatings, roofing, construction products and related products. For example, unusually cold and rainy weather, especially during the general construction and exterior painting season, could have an adverse effect on sales of such products. As a result, we have historically experienced weaker sales and net income in our third fiscal quarter (December through February) in comparison to our performance during our other fiscal quarters.", "PERMNO": 65307, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "RPM"}
