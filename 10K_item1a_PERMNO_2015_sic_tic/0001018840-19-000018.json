{"cik": "1018840", "company": "ABERCROMBIE & FITCH CO /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS.\nWe caution that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or made by us, our management or our spokespeople involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which may be beyond our control. Words such as \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend\u201d and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. The following factors, categorized by the primary nature of the associated risk, could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward-looking statements.\nMacroeconomic and industry risks include:\n\u2022\nChanges in global economic and financial conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity;\n\u2022\nFailure to anticipate customer demand and changing fashion trends and to manage our inventory commensurately could adversely impact our sales levels and profitability;\n\u2022\nOur market share may be negatively impacted by increasing competition and pricing pressures from companies with brands or merchandise competitive with ours;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of the shopping malls or area attractions that our stores are located in or around; and,\n\u2022\nThe impact of war, acts of terrorism or civil unrest could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nStrategic risks include:\n\u2022\nThe expansion of our direct-to-consumer sales channels and omnichannel initiatives are significant components of our growth strategy, and the failure to successfully develop our position across all channels could have an adverse impact on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nOur international growth strategy and ability to conduct business in international markets may be adversely affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks; and,\n\u2022\nFailure to successfully implement our strategic plans could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nOperational risks include:\n\u2022\nFailure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands;\n\u2022\nOur business could suffer if our information technology systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively;\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber-attacks, data protection, credit card fraud and identity theft that would cause us to incur unexpected expenses and reputation loss;\n\u2022\nOur reliance on DCs makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our supply chain;\n\u2022\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor, transportation, and trade relations could cause manufacturing delays and increase our costs;\n\u2022\nWe depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture and delivery of all our merchandise, and a disruption of the manufacture or delivery of our merchandise could result in lost sales and could increase our costs;\n\u2022\nWe rely on the experience and skills of our senior executive officers and associates, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business; and,\n\u2022\nExtreme weather conditions, including natural disasters, pandemic disease and other unexpected events, could negatively impact our facilities, systems and stores, as well as the facilities and systems of our vendors and manufacturers, which could result in an interruption to our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nLegal, tax, regulatory and compliance risks include:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nOur litigation exposure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets;\n\u2022\nChanges in the regulatory or compliance landscape and compliance with changing regulations for accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reported financial results; and,\n\u2022\nOur Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe factors listed above are not our only risks. Additional risks may arise and current evaluations of risks may change, which could lead to material, adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition. The following sets forth a description of the preceding risk factors that we believe may be relevant to an understanding of our business. These risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of our forward-looking statements.\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS.\nChanges in global economic and financial conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as other changes in consumer discretionary spending habits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur business depends on consumer demand for our merchandise. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, can be adversely impacted by recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Our performance is subject to factors that affect worldwide economic conditions including unemployment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on declines in the financial, residential real estate and mortgage markets, sales and personal income tax rates, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, the value of the U.S. Dollar versus foreign currencies and other macroeconomic factors. Additionally, changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending habits may negatively impact the specialty apparel retail market. Global economic uncertainty, such as the June 2016 decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies, could cause changes in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources if reduced consumer demand for our merchandise should occur. It could also impact our ability to fund growth and/or result in our becoming reliant on external financing, the availability and cost of which may be uncertain.\nThe economic conditions and factors described above could adversely affect the profitability of our business, as well as adversely affect the pace of new store openings, store remodels or rightsizes, and could affect the productivity of these stores. Finally, the economic environment may exacerbate some of the risks noted below, including consumer demand, strain on available resources, our international growth strategy, availability of real estate, interruption of the flow of merchandise from key vendors and manufacturers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nFailure to anticipate customer demand and changing fashion trends and to manage our inventory commensurately could adversely impact our sales levels and profitability.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to anticipate and gauge the fashion preferences of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies constantly shifting demands in a timely manner. Because we may enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand, pricing shifts, and the sub-optimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will continue to anticipate consumer demands and accurately plan inventory successfully in the future. Changing consumer preferences and fashion trends, whether we are able to anticipate, identify and respond to them or not, could adversely impact our sales. Inventory levels for certain merchandise styles no longer considered to be \u201con trend\u201d may increase, leading to higher markdowns to sell through excess inventory and, therefore, lower than planned margins. A distressed economic and retail environment, in which many of our competitors continue to engage in aggressive promotional activities increases the importance of reacting appropriately to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our merchandise, or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales. In addition, we could be at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to leverage data analytics to retrieve timely, customer insights to appropriately respond to customer demands. Any of these events could significantly harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur market share may be negatively impacted by increasing competition and pricing pressures from companies with brands or merchandise competitive with ours.\nThe sale of apparel and personal care products through stores and direct-to-consumer channels is a highly competitive business with numerous participants, including individual and chain specialty apparel retailers, local, regional, national and international department stores, discount stores and online businesses. Proliferation of the direct-to-consumer channel within the last few years has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies. We face a variety of competitive challenges, including:\n\u2022\nanticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands or preferences better than our competitors, including being able to adapt to new, emerging technologies that alter customer experience expectations;\n\u2022\nmaintaining favorable brand recognition and effective marketing of our products to consumers in several diverse demographic markets;\n\u2022\nretaining customers, including our loyalty club members, as it becomes increasingly difficult due to shifts in customer preferences and demographics, and if we were to fail, it could result in increased marketing costs to acquire new customers;\n\u2022\nsourcing merchandise efficiently;\n\u2022\ndeveloping innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to our consumers and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors; and,\n\u2022\ncountering the aggressive pricing and promotional activities of many of our competitors without diminishing the aspirational nature of our brands and brand equity.\nIn light of the competitive challenges we face, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future. Further, increases in competition could reduce our sales and harm our operating results and business.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency in which each entity operates, while our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we must translate revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities from functional currencies into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during, or at the end of the reporting period. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency, including intercompany transactions, which results in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Furthermore, we purchase substantially all of our inventory in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our sales, gross profit and gross profit rate from international operations will be negatively impacted during periods of a strengthened U.S. dollar relative to the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, tourism spending may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and as a result, sales in our flagship stores and other stores with higher tourism traffic have, at times, been adversely impacted, and may continue to be adversely impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain events, such as the June 2016 decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, such as the threat of additional tariffs on imported consumer goods from China, have increased global economic and political uncertainty and caused volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business and results of operations may be impacted by these developments.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends, in part, on the success of the shopping malls or area attractions that our stores are located in or around.\nOur stores are primarily located in shopping malls and other shopping centers, certain of which have been experiencing declines in customer traffic. Our sales at these stores, as well as sales at our flagship locations, are partially dependent upon the volume of traffic in those shopping centers and the surrounding area. Our stores may benefit from the ability of a shopping center\u2019s other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of the shopping center. We cannot control the loss of a significant tenant in a shopping mall or area attraction, the development of new shopping malls in the U.S. or around the world, the availability or cost of appropriate locations or the success of individual shopping malls and there is competition with other retailers for prominent locations. Although we attempt to open new stores in prominent locations, it is possible that some malls that were in prominent locations when we opened our stores may cease to be viewed as prominent. In addition, if our stores do not meet our expectations, it may be appropriate to exit the lease earlier than originally anticipated, which could result in material lease termination charges. If the popularity of shopping malls declines among our customers, our sales may decline, which would impact our gross profits and net income. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our productivity or our growth objectives for our stores and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPart of our future growth is dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs.\nThe impact of war, acts of terrorism or civil unrest could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the associated heightened security measures and military actions in response to acts of terrorism have disrupted commerce. Further acts of terrorism, future conflicts or civil unrest may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence and consumer spending by causing domestic and/or tourist traffic in malls and in our flagship and other stores to decline, which could negatively impact our sales revenue. Furthermore, war or an act of terrorism, or the threat thereof, or any other unforeseen interruption of commerce, could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain merchandise from foreign manufacturers. With a substantial portion of our merchandise being imported from foreign countries, failure to obtain merchandise from our foreign manufacturers or substitute other manufacturers, at similar costs and in a timely manner, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS.\nThe expansion of our direct-to-consumer sales channels and omnichannel initiatives are significant components of our growth strategy, and the failure to successfully develop our position across all channels could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nConsumers are increasingly shopping online and via mobile devices, and we have made significant investments in capital spending and labor to develop these channels globally, invested in digital media to attract new customers and developed localized fulfillment, shipping and customer service operations. As omnichannel retailing continues to grow and evolve, our customers increasingly interact with our brands through a variety of media including smart phones and tablets, and expect seamless integration across all touchpoints. Our success depends on our ability to introduce innovative means of engaging our customers and our ability to respond to shifting consumer traffic patterns and direct-to-consumer buying trends. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully maintain or expand our direct-to-consumer sales channels and omnichannel initiatives, or that we will see return on our significant investments, and failure to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties or to successfully maintain and expand our direct-to-consumer business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, direct-to-consumer operations are subject to numerous risks, including reliance on third-party computer hardware/software and service providers, data breaches, violations of state, federal or international laws, including those relating to online privacy, credit card fraud, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and disruption of internet service. Changes in foreign governmental regulations may also negatively impact our ability to deliver product to our customers. Failure to successfully respond to these risks may adversely affect sales in our direct-to-consumer business as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nOur international growth strategy and ability to conduct business in international markets may be adversely affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nInternational expansion is a significant component of our growth strategy and may require significant investment, which could strain our resources and adversely impact current store performance, while adding complexity to our current operations. We are subject to domestic laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If any of our overseas operations, or our associates or agents, violate such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, increasing global economic uncertainty with respect to the June 2016 decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, such as China, could affect our international expansion plans.\nAdditionally, we may face operational issues that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations if we fail to address certain factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\naddress the different operational characteristics present in each country in which we operate, including employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, lease provisions and local reporting or legal requirements;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain good relations with individual associates and groups of associates;\n\u2022\navoid work stoppages or other labor-related issues in our European stores where associates are represented by workers\u2019 councils and unions;\n\u2022\nretain acceptance from foreign customers;\n\u2022\nmanage inventory effectively to meet the needs of existing stores on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\nmanage foreign currency exchange rate risks effectively.\nFailure to successfully implement our strategic plans could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nOur ability to execute our long-term strategies successfully and in a timely fashion is subject to various risks and uncertainties as described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Specifically, these risks can be categorized into macroeconomic risk, strategic risk, operational risk and legal, tax, regulatory and compliance risk. Achieving the goals of our long-term strategy is also dependent on us executing the strategy successfully. Finally, it may take longer than anticipated to generate the expected benefits from our long-term strategy, the initiatives we implement in connection with our long-term strategy may not resonate with our customers and there can be no guarantee that these initiatives will result in improved operating results. In addition, failure to successfully implement our long-term strategy could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS.\nFailure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brands. Our reputation could be jeopardized if, for example, we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity, if our third-party vendors fail to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct, if any actions taken by our associates don\u2019t align with our values and fail to comply with our associate code of conduct, if any third parties with which we have a business relationship fail to represent our brands in a manner consistent with our brand image and customer experience standards or as a result of a cyber-attack. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Public perception about our products or our stores, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the increasing use of social media platforms allows for rapid communication and any negative publicity related to the aforementioned concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for these or any other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur business could suffer if our information technology systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to operate our websites; record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; manage inventory; purchase, sell and ship merchandise on a timely basis; and maintain cost-efficient operations. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems and maintain data security. Despite efforts to prevent such an occurrence, our information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from computer viruses, power system failures, third-party intrusions, inadvertent or intentional breach by our employees and other technical malfunctions. If our systems are damaged, or fail to function properly, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems, and we could endure delays in our operations.\nWhile we regularly evaluate our information technology systems and requirements, we are aware of the inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems could cause information to be lost or delayed, including data related to customer orders. Such a loss or delay, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during our peak selling seasons, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with cyber-attacks, data protection, credit card fraud and identity theft that would cause us to incur unexpected expenses and reputation loss.\nIn the standard course of business, we receive and maintain confidential information about customers, associates and other third parties. In addition, third parties also receive and maintain certain confidential information. The protection of this information is critical to our business and subjects us to numerous laws, rules and regulations domestically and in foreign jurisdictions. The retail industry in particular has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the global regulatory environment is increasingly demanding with frequent new and changing requirements surrounding cybersecurity, information security and privacy, such as the China Cybersecurity Law and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data and creates new individual privacy rights. We may incur significant costs related to prevention and to comply with laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including customer payment information.\nIt is possible that an individual or group could defeat our security measures, or those of a third-party service provider, and access confidential information. Rapidly evolving technologies, payment capabilities and types of cyber-attacks may result in this information being compromised or breached. We endeavor to protect confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, including training programs for associates to raise awareness about phishing, malware and other cyber risks and could experience increased costs associated with maintaining these protections as threats of cyber-attacks increase in sophistication and complexity. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving cyber-attacks. Actual or anticipated cyber-attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including, but not limited to, costs to deploy additional personnel and protective technologies, train associates and engage third-party experts and consultants. Data and security breaches could occur as a result of non-technical issues, including deliberate or unintentional breach by our associates or third-party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of confidential information. Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient for a specific cyber incident, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely fashion. Exposure of customer data through any means, could result in damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence, regulatory fines and penalties, legal liability and costs of litigation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nOur reliance on DCs makes us susceptible to disruptions or adverse conditions affecting our supply chain.\nWe primarily use one contract carrier to ship merchandise and related materials to our North American stores and direct-to-consumer customers, and several contract carriers for our international stores and direct-to-consumer customers. As a result, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as system failures, accidents, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, as well as other unforeseen events and circumstances. We rely on our DCs to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our merchandise. If our distribution operations were disrupted, our ability to replace inventory in our stores and process direct-to-consumer and wholesale orders could be interrupted negatively impacting sales and we could experience increased costs related to these disruptions. Refer to \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS,\u201d for a listing of the DCs we rely on.\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of raw materials, labor, transportation, and trade relations could cause manufacturing delays and increase our costs.\nChanges in the cost, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales, or our ability to meet customer demand. The prices for such fabrics depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton, as well as the cost of compliance with sourcing laws. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields and weather patterns. Such factors may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global climate change. In addition, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly, and as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate. The Company is also susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of transportation. We may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher raw materials prices or labor or transportation costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our gross margin and results of our operations. Recently, there has been greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, such as the threat of additional tariffs on imported consumer goods from China and the June 2016 decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Major developments in trade policies, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture and delivery of all our merchandise, and a disruption of the manufacture or delivery of our merchandise could result in lost sales and could increase our costs.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. As a result, the continued success of our operations is tied to our timely receipt of quality merchandise from third-party manufacturers. We source the majority of our merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with approximately 150 vendors which includes foreign manufacturers located throughout the world, primarily in Asia. Political, social or economic instability in the regions in which our manufacturers are located could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the U.S. A manufacturer\u2019s inability to ship orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards could cause delays in responding to consumer demand and negatively affect consumer confidence or negatively impact our competitive position, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOther events that could disrupt the timely delivery of our merchandise include new trade law provisions or regulations, reliance on a limited number of shipping carriers, significant labor disputes and significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations or capacity limitations. Furthermore, we are susceptible to increases in fuel costs which may increase the cost of distribution. If we are not able to pass this cost on to our customers, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the experience and skills of our senior executive officers and associates, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to succeed may be adversely impacted if we are not able to attract, retain and develop talent and future leaders, including our senior executive officers and associates. Our senior executive officers closely supervise all aspects of our business including the design of our merchandise and the operation of our stores and have substantial experience and expertise in the retail business and have an integral role in the growth and success of our brands. If we were to lose the benefit of the involvement of multiple senior executives or other personnel, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if unexpected turnover occurs at the associate level without adequate succession plans, the loss of the services of any of these individuals, or any resulting negative perceptions of our business, could damage our reputation and our business. Competition for such qualified talent is intense, and we cannot be sure we will be able to attract, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified individuals in future periods.\nExtreme weather conditions, including natural disasters, pandemic disease and other unexpected events, could negatively impact our facilities, systems and stores, as well as the facilities and systems of our vendors and manufacturers, which could result in an interruption to our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur retail stores, corporate offices, distribution centers, infrastructure projects and direct-to-consumer operations, as well as the operations of our vendors and manufacturers, are vulnerable to damage from natural disasters, pandemic disease and other unexpected events. If any of these events result in damage to our facilities, systems or stores, or the facilities or systems of our vendors or manufacturers, we may experience interruptions in our business until the damage is repaired, resulting in the potential loss of customers and revenues. In addition, we may incur costs in repairing any damage which exceeds our applicable insurance coverage.\nIn addition, historically, our operations have been seasonal, with a significant amount of net sales and operating income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. As a result of this seasonality, net sales and net income during any fiscal quarter cannot be used as an accurate indicator of our annual results. Unseasonable weather may diminish demand for our seasonal merchandise and severe weather conditions or changes in weather patterns may also influence consumer preferences and fashion trends, consumer traffic and shopping habits. Any of the factors listed above could reduce sales and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility in our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales, consumption or value-added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d) in many jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or losses by taxing jurisdictions or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Fluctuations in duties could also have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In some international markets, we are required to hold and submit VAT to the appropriate local tax authorities. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the appropriate amounts could subject us to substantial fines and penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, tax law may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our current or future tax structure and effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was enacted into law, which made broad and significantly complex changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. Although the Company completed its accounting related to the Act in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Act should be applied or otherwise administered that differs from our interpretations and could impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. Refer to Note 9, \u201cINCOME TAXES,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOur litigation exposure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, along with third parties we do business with, are involved, from time to time, in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation matters may include, but are not limited to, contract disputes, employment-related actions, labor relations, commercial litigation, intellectual property rights and shareholder actions. Any litigation that we become a party to could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our current litigation exposure could be impacted by litigation trends, discovery of damaging facts with respect to legal matters pending against us or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact that are not in accordance with management\u2019s evaluation of existing claims. Should management\u2019s evaluation prove incorrect, our exposure could greatly exceed expectations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets.\nWe believe our core trademarks, Abercrombie & Fitch\u00ae, abercrombie\u00ae, Hollister\u00ae, Gilly Hicks\u00ae and the \u201cMoose\u201d and \u201cSeagull\u201d logos, are essential to the effective implementation of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the registries of countries in key markets within the Company\u2019s sales and distribution channels. In addition, these trademarks are either registered, or the Company has applications for registration pending, with the registries of many of the foreign countries in which the manufacturers of the Company\u2019s products are located. There can be no assurance that we will obtain registrations that have been applied for or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. Although brand security initiatives are in place, we cannot guarantee that our efforts against the counterfeiting of our brands will be successful. If a third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand image could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all categories, or in all foreign countries in which we source or offer our merchandise now, or may in the future, our international expansion and our merchandising of products using these marks could be limited. The pending applications for international registration of various trademarks could be challenged or rejected in those countries because third parties of whom we are not currently aware have already registered similar marks in those countries. Accordingly, it may be possible, in those foreign countries where the status of various applications is pending or unclear, for a third-party owner of the national trademark registration for a similar mark to prohibit the manufacture, sale or exportation of branded goods in or from that country. Failure to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use our trademarks or\nlogos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from, or manufacture in, less costly markets or penetrate new markets should our business plan include selling our merchandise in those non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nChanges in the regulatory or compliance landscape and compliance with changing regulations for accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reported financial results.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including customs, truth-in-advertising, securities laws, consumer protection, general privacy, health information privacy, identity theft, online privacy, general employment laws, employee health and safety, minimum wage laws, unsolicited commercial communication and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, intellectual property, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores, direct-to-consumer operations and distribution centers.\nIf these laws and regulations were to change, or were violated by our management, associates, suppliers, vendors or other parties with whom we do business, the costs of certain merchandise could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our merchandise, be subject to fines or penalties, temporary or permanent store closures, increased regulatory scrutiny or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation including the areas referenced above, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal and various international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. For example, the June 2016 decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union could cause business uncertainty and create an additional administrative burden to adhere to changes in regulatory frameworks concerning critical areas, including, but not limited to, the movement of goods or the movement of people. In addition, changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, could cause our costs to increase.\nIn addition, changing regulatory requirements for corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC regulations and the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) are creating additional complexities for public companies. For example, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. In addition, the potential requirement to transition to, or converge with, international financial reporting standards in the future may create uncertainty and additional complexities. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, financial reform legislation, government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations. For example, there has been increasing pressure for the SEC to develop a standardized disclosure framework under which public companies would be required to disclose identified environmental, social and governance factors relating to their operations, which could create additional complexities and costs. These changing regulatory requirements may lead to additional compliance costs, as well as the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from strategic business activities and could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods.\nOur Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, expires on October 19, 2022 and our Term Loan Agreement, as amended, has a maturity date of August 7, 2021. Both our Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement and our Term Loan Agreement contain restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exemptions, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make certain investments, pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock and engage in mergers. The inability to obtain credit on commercially reasonable terms in the future when these facilities expire could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, market conditions could potentially impact the size and terms of a replacement facility or facilities.", "PERMNO": 83976, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "ANF"}
