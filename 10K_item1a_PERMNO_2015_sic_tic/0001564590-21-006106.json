You should review carefully the risk factors listed below, as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the SEC. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our disclosure and analysis in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management\u2019s current plans and assumptions. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 initially in China and its subsequent spread globally through 2020 has resulted in significant and widespread global infections and fatalities. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the COVID-19 virus a pandemic. The spread of the virus has resulted in various federal, state and provincial governments declaring emergency measures and the implementation of numerous measures to attempt to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, business closures, shelter in place orders and other shutdowns and restrictions.\nThe impact of the pandemic and the global response thereto has, among other things, significantly disrupted global economic activity, negatively impacted gross domestic product and caused significant volatility in financial markets, with various countries already reporting significant declines in gross domestic product and business activity and material increases in unemployment. While various countries, including the United States, Germany, Canada and China have implemented stimulus packages and other fiscal measures to attempt to reduce the impact of the pandemic on their economies, the impact of the pandemic on global economic activity and markets both in the short and longer term is uncertain at this time.\nAs demand for our products has principally historically been determined by general global macro-economic activities, demand and prices for our products have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns. A significant economic downturn may adversely affect our sales and profitability and may also adversely affect our customers and suppliers. Additionally, significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future.\n(32)\nCommencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, there has been a significant widespread increase or \"second wave\" in reported infections including in Europe, the United States and Canada, as well as the emergence and rapid spread of new variants of the COVID-19 virus. In response, various countries including in Europe have announced the re-imposition of restrictions on social, business, travel and other activities. In several countries such restrictions are at or near the level of lockdown restrictions imposed earlier in 2020. In February 2021, a couple of individuals at our Peace River mill tested positive for COVID-19. Following both provincial health protocols and our own health and safety policies, the mill was able to continue normal operations. We are currently working with the provincial health authority to implement broad-based testing at the mill.\nIn December 2020, various countries approved the use of certain vaccines to aid in the prevention and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Vaccinations started to be rolled out in late 2020 and are expected to continue throughout 2021. Although trial results for the vaccines were positive and encouraging, we cannot predict how successful the vaccines will be against COVID-19 or any of its variants, if there will be significant adverse side effects, how quickly the vaccines will be available and rolled out to the general population, the level of willingness of people to get vaccinated and how long it will take the vaccines to be effective enough for global economies to reopen.\nCurrently, we are unable to predict the impact of the recent resurgence in infections or emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, the extent of measures governments may take in response thereto, including imposing some or all prior or new restrictive measures, including business closures, nor the effectiveness of and the time required to roll out vaccinations on a large scale. Further, we are currently unable to predict the overall impact of such resurgence or emergence on global economic activity or the pace of any economic recovery.\nOur products are an important constituent of many pandemic related high demand goods such as tissue and cleaning products and certain personal protective equipment. However, our mills could experience disruptions, downtime and closures in the future as a result of changes to existing government response measures, outbreaks of the virus among our employees or operations or disruptions to raw material supplies or access to logistics networks.\nThe magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is currently uncertain. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u2022\nthe duration and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022\ngovernmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and may in the future be taken in response to the pandemic including any resurgence or additional waves of viral infection or any emergence and spread of new variants of the virus;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response thereto, including the recent easing of health and safety restrictions, measures and closures to reopened economies;\n\u2022\nany resurgence in infections and fatalities resulting from recent efforts of governments to reopen economies;\n\u2022\nany additional waves of the virus;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of vaccines and when vaccines will become widely available;\n\u2022\nthe effect on our customers' demand for pulp and wood products;\n\u2022\nour vendors' ability to supply us with raw materials;\n\u2022\nthe availability of logistics networks, our ability to ship our products to customers and the availability of any required contractors to perform maintenance services;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to pay for our products; and\n\u2022\nany closures of our and our customers' facilities and offices.\nThe effect of the pandemic, including remote working arrangements for employees, has also increased the risk of cyberattacks on, and other material breaches of, our and our third party service providers' information technology systems.\n(33)\nOur business is highly cyclical in nature.\nThe pulp and lumber businesses are highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn can materially affect prices. Pulp and lumber markets are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp and lumber are commodities that are generally available from other producers. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand.\nIndustry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production capacity or permanently close mills. In addition, to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill, some producers will choose to operate at a loss, sometimes even a cash loss, which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply. Oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends. Certain integrated pulp and paper producers have the ability to discontinue paper production by idling their paper machines and selling their pulp production on the market, if market conditions, prices and trends warrant such actions.\nCurrently, we are aware of 1.9 million ADMTs of announced capacity increases, primarily of hardwood kraft pulp in 2021. However, we cannot predict whether new capacity will be announced or will come on line in the future. If any new capacity, particularly for NBSK pulp, is not absorbed in the market or offset by curtailments or closures of older, high-cost pulp mills, the increase could put downward pressure on pulp prices and materially adversely affect our results of operations, margin and profitability. Additionally, while NBHK pulp is not a direct competitor to NBSK pulp, if any future increases in pulp supply are not absorbed by demand growth, such supply could put downward pressure on NBSK pulp prices as well.\nDemand for each of pulp and lumber has historically been determined primarily by general global macro-economic conditions and has been closely tied to overall business activity. Pulp prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and can fluctuate widely over time. Between 2011 and 2020, average European list prices for NBSK pulp have fluctuated between a low of approximately $760 per ADMT in 2012 to a high of $1,230 per ADMT in 2018. In the same period, the average North American NBHK price has fluctuated between a low of $700 per ADMT in 2012 to a high of $1,235 per ADMT in 2018.\nA pulp producer\u2019s actual sales price realizations are list prices net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Our sales price realizations may also be affected by price movements between the order and shipment dates.\nAccordingly, prices for pulp and lumber are driven by many factors outside our control, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. Because market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for pulp and lumber, prices may fall below our cash production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our mills. Therefore, our profitability depends on managing our cost structure, particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. If the prices of our products decline, or if prices for our raw materials increase, or both, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n(34)\nCyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials, particularly fiber, could adversely affect our business.\nOur main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs. Fiber represented approximately 52% of our pulp cash production costs and approximately 69% of our lumber cash production costs in 2020. Fiber is a commodity and both prices and supply are cyclical. Fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences and our costs of fiber may increase in a region as a result of local market shifts. The cost of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Demand for these raw materials is generally determined by the volume of pulp and paper products and wood products produced globally and regionally. Governmental regulations related to the environment, forest stewardship and green or renewable energy can also affect the supply of fiber. In Germany, governmental initiatives to increase the supply of renewable energy have led to more renewable energy projects in Europe, including Germany. Demand for wood residuals from such energy producers, combined with lower harvesting rates, has generally put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals, such as wood chips, in Germany and its neighboring countries. This has historically resulted in higher fiber costs for our German pulp mills and such trend could continue to put further upward pressure on wood chip prices. Wood chip supply in Germany was generally stable during the last three years due to stable sawmill production and lower demand from pellet producers and board manufacturers; however, there is no assurance that wood chip supply will continue to be stable or that supply will not be reduced or that fiber costs will not increase in the future.\nSimilarly, North American sawmill activity declined significantly during the recession, reducing the supply of chips and availability of pulp logs to pulp mills, including our Celgar mill. Additionally, North American energy producers are exploring the viability of renewable energy initiatives and governmental initiatives in this field are increasing, all of which could lead to higher demand for sawmill residual fiber, including chips. A recovery in U.S. housing starts, which commenced in the latter part of 2012 and continued through the first half of 2018, resulted in increased sawmill activity. This increased the supply of wood chips for the Celgar mill and reduced its need for pulp logs, which are generally a higher cost for the mill than wood chips. However, a slowdown in sawmilling activities that commenced in the second half of 2018 reduced the availability of both wood chips and pulp logs and put upward pressure on fiber costs. There is no assurance that sawmill activity will improve or become stable or that fiber prices will not increase in the future.\nThe 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement, which governed softwood lumber exports from Canada to the United States, expired in 2015, and a one-year post-expiration period during which the United States agreed not to impose trade sanctions expired in October 2016. In November 2016, a petition was filed by a coalition of U.S. lumber producers to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission requesting an investigation into alleged subsidies provided to Canadian lumber producers. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced various countervailing and anti-dumping duty rates on Canadian softwood lumber and the United States and Canada have engaged in proceedings under the North American Free Trade Agreement and through the World Trade Organization. In November 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce reduced the countervailing duty to 7.42% and the anti-dumping rate to 1.57%, for a total cash deposit rate of 8.99% for \"all other\" Canadian lumber producers. It is uncertain when or if the United States and Canada may settle a new agreement and what terms or restrictions it may contain. Any duties or other restrictions imposed on Canadian softwood lumber exports by the United States could negatively impact Canadian sawmill production in our Canadian mills\u2019 supply area and result in reduced availability and increased costs for wood chips for our Canadian mills. While we believe this may be partially offset by increased wood chip supply from U.S. sawmills and pulp log availability, we cannot currently predict the overall effect on our Canadian mills\u2019 overall fiber costs.\nAvailability of fiber may be further limited by adverse responses to and prevention of wildfires, weather, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, flooding and other natural causes. In addition, the quantity, quality and price of fiber we receive could be affected by man-made causes such as those resulting from industrial disputes, material curtailments or shut-down of operations by suppliers, government orders and legislation (including new taxes or tariffs). Any or a combination of these can affect fiber prices in a region.\nThe cyclical nature of pricing for fiber represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp and lumber producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers or we cannot offset such costs through higher prices for our surplus energy.\n(35)\nOther than the renewable forest licenses of MPR, we do not own any timberlands or have any material long-term governmental timber concessions. We also currently have few long-term fiber contracts at our German operations. Fiber is available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases. However, our requirements have increased and may continue to do so as we expand capacity through capital projects or other efficiency measures at our mills. As a result, we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply. An insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the supply of fiber, we are, to a lesser extent, dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities. Any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation. Any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition in our markets.\nWe sell our pulp and lumber globally, with a large percentage sold in Europe, Asia and North America. The markets for pulp and lumber are highly competitive. A number of other global companies compete in each of these markets and no company holds a dominant position. Our pulp and lumber are considered commodities because many companies produce similar and largely standardized products. As a result, the primary basis for competition in our markets has been price. Many of our competitors have greater resources and lower leverage than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to industry or market changes or devote greater resources to the sale of products than we can. Additionally, certain of our competitors are fully or more vertically integrated than we are and may have different priorities when operating their respective businesses. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be competitive in the future. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. Our ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends, in large part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control.\nOur mills and operations voluntarily subject themselves to third-party certification as to compliance with internationally recognized, sustainable management standards because end use paper and lumber customers have shown an increased interest in understanding the origin of products they purchase. Demand for our products could be adversely affected if we, or our suppliers, are unable to achieve compliance or are perceived by the public as failing to comply with these standards or if our customers require compliance with alternate standards for which our operations are not certified.\nGlobal pulp and lumber markets have historically been characterized by considerable swings in prices which have and will result in variability in our earnings.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with climate change and social and government responses thereto.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers are subject to climate change variations which can impact the productivity of forests, the abundance of species, harvest levels and lumber. Further, over the last few years, changing weather patterns and climate conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the frequency and unpredictability of natural disasters like storms, wildfires and wind, snow and ice storms. One or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our fiber supply which is our largest cash production cost. There are differing scientific studies and opinions relating to the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is or may be occurring around the world. As a result, we are currently unable to identify and predict all of the specific consequences of climate change on our business and operations.\nFurther, governmental initiatives in response to climate change also have an impact on operations. There continue to be numerous international, country level and regional initiatives to address global and country specific climate issues.\nIn Germany, government and social focus on and demand for carbon neutral or green energy has created greater demand and competition for the wood residuals or fiber that is consumed by our pulp mills as part of their production processes. This has helped drive up the cost of fiber for German mills. In addition, further or new\n(36)\ngovernmental initiatives or legislation may also increase both the demand and prices for wood residuals. As governments pursue green energy initiatives, they may implement financial, tax, pricing or other legislated incentives for renewable energy producers that \u201ccannibalize\u201d or materially adversely affect fiber supplies for existing traditional users, such as lumber and pulp and paper producers.\nSuch additional demand for wood residuals and/or governmental initiatives may materially increase the competition and prices for wood residuals over time. This could increase our fiber costs and/or restrict our ability to acquire fiber at competitive prices or at all during times of shortages. If our fiber costs increase and we cannot pass on these costs to our customers or offset them through higher prices for our sales of surplus energy, it will negatively affect our operating margins, results of operations and financial position. If we cannot obtain the fiber required to operate our mills, we may have to curtail and/or shut down production. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial results and financial position.\nOther risks to our business from climate change include:\n\u2022\na greater susceptibility of northern forests to disease, fire and insect infestation, which could diminish fiber availability;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms;\n\u2022\nthe loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations;\n\u2022\nthe loss of northern forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and\n\u2022\nlower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals.\nThe occurrence of any or a combination of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or financial results.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for such capital requirements.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires that we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment, improve efficiencies and, as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures, bring our operations into compliance with such regulations. In addition, we may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures. Increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. If our available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund our operating needs and capital expenditures, we would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay our capital expenditures. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health, limit our operations or impair our ability to raise additional capital. If this occurs, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as may be required from time to time, we may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively. An inability to make required capital expenditures in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have limited control over the operations of the Cariboo mill.\nOur 50% ownership interest in the Cariboo mill is through an unincorporated joint venture. The ownership and operation of the Cariboo mill is subject to the agreement underlying the joint venture and its day-to-day operations are principally conducted by our joint venture partner. Joint ventures generally involve special risks, including that the business and strategic interests of the joint venture partner and ourselves may not coincide or that the joint venture partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations thereunder. We have limited control over the actions of the joint venture partner in respect of the Cariboo mill, including any non-performance, default or bankruptcy of such party. Any non-performance by our joint venture partner or other actions taken by the joint venture partner in connection with the day-to-day operation of the Cariboo mill may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n(37)\nFluctuations in prices and demand for lumber could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial performance of the Friesau mill depends on the demand for and selling price of lumber, which is subject to significant fluctuations. The markets for lumber are highly volatile and are affected by economic conditions in Europe, Asia and the United States, the strength of housing markets in such regions, the growing importance of the Asian market, changes in industry production capacity, changes in inventory levels and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, interest rates have a significant impact on residential construction and renovation activity, which in turn influence the demand for and price of lumber.\nAdverse housing market conditions may increase the credit risk from customers of our wood products segment.\nOur wood products segment generally extends credit to customers who are generally susceptible to the same economic business risks that we are. Unfavorable housing market conditions could result in financial failures of one or more of such customers. If such customers\u2019 financial position becomes impaired, our ability to fully collect receivables from such customers could be impaired and negatively affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur wood products segment lumber products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.\nOur lumber products may compete with alternative products. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the lumber products produced by our wood products segment. Changes in the prices for oil, chemicals and other products can change the competitive position of our wood products segment lumber products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our wood products segment products. If use of these alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our wood products segment products could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience material disruptions to our production.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our pulp, lumber and energy sales and/or negatively impact our results of operations. Any of our mills could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nunscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nemployee errors or failures;\n\u2022\ndesign error or employee or contractor error;\n\u2022\nchemical spill or release;\n\u2022\nexplosion of a boiler;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railway tracks, tunnels, canals and ports;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, earthquakes, windstorms, pest infestations, severe weather conditions or other natural catastrophes affecting our production of goods or the supply of raw materials like fiber;\n\u2022\nprolonged supply disruption of major inputs;\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties;\n\u2022\ncapital projects that require temporary cost increases or curtailment of production; and\n\u2022\nother operational problems.\n(38)\nAny such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture acquisitions may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business.\nIn order to grow our business, we may seek to acquire additional assets or companies. Our ability to pursue selective and accretive acquisitions will be dependent on management\u2019s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition targets in both new and existing markets. In pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities, we face competition from other companies having similar growth strategies, many of which may have substantially greater resources than us. Competition for these acquisitions or investment targets could result in increased acquisition or investment prices, higher risks and a diminished pool of businesses or assets available for acquisition.\nAcquisitions also frequently result in recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the costs of integrating acquired businesses (including restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions, as well as other acquisition costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees and investment banking fees) could significantly impact our operating results.\nAlthough we perform diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. We may not be able to ascertain the value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses and their operations until we assume operating control of the assets and operations of these businesses.\nFurthermore, future acquisitions could entail a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations, including financial and accounting functions, sales and marketing procedures, technology and other corporate administrative functions of the combined operations;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to substantial unanticipated liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in realizing projected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ndifficulty maintaining relationships with present and potential customers, distributors and suppliers due to uncertainties regarding service, production quality and prices; and\n\u2022\nproblems retaining key employees.\nIf we are unable to address any of these risks, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks related to our employees.\nThe majority of our employees are unionized and we have collective agreements in place with our employees at all of our mills, other than the Peace River mill which is non-union. Although we have not experienced any material work stoppages in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements. This could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers. The registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Additionally, changing demographics may make it more difficult for us to recruit skilled employees in the future. Accordingly, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, whenever we seek to reduce the workforce at any of our mills, the affected mill\u2019s labor force could seek to hinder or delay such actions, we could incur material severance or other costs and our operations could be disrupted.\n(39)\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur future success depends, to a large extent, on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers. Such officers are industry professionals, many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles.\nThe loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive or senior mill operating officers.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Should the markets for our products deteriorate or should we decide to invest capital differently or should other cash flow assumptions change, it is possible that we will be required to record non-cash impairment charges in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate.\nWe have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our mills. Our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions. Damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by, or exceed the limits of, our insurance coverage. Additionally, the weak global and financial markets have also reduced the availability and extent of credit insurance for our customers. If we cannot obtain adequate credit insurance for our customers, we may be forced to amend or curtail our planned operations which could negatively impact our sales revenues, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on third parties for transportation services.\nOur business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of pulp and lumber to our customers, as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills. Our pulp, lumber and raw materials are principally transported by truck, barge, rail and sea-going vessels, all of which are highly regulated. Increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nFurther, if our transportation providers fail to deliver our pulp or lumber in a timely manner, it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to manufacture pulp or lumber in response to customer orders or sell them at full value. Also, if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe periodically use derivatives to manage certain risks which could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe periodically use derivatives related to currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and energy prices. We record unrealized gains or losses on our derivative instruments when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled. These unrealized and realized gains and losses can materially impact our operating results for any reporting period.\nIf any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize is not effective, we may incur losses which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The purpose of our derivative activity may also be considered speculative in nature; we do not use these instruments with respect to any pre-set percentage of revenues or other formula, but either to augment our potential gains or reduce our potential losses depending on our perception of future economic events and developments.\n(40)\nFailures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe use information technologies to manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store and report on our business and to communicate electronically between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers as well as for administrative functions and many of such technology systems are dependent on one another for their functionality. We also use information technologies to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We rely on third party providers for some of these information technologies and support. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products is highly dependent on our technology systems. Despite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and those of our third party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing hardware, software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such interruption or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and personnel. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and research and development initiatives. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party\u2019s information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of our customers\u2019 or personnel\u2019s data or confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material liability.\nRisks Related to our Debt\nOur level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,145.3 million of indebtedness outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our high debt levels may have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes or to fund future operations may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all;\n\u2022\na significant amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to current and future adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\na substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements, which could force us to modify our operations;\n\u2022\nour leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u2022\ncausing us to offer debt or equity securities on terms that may not be favorable to us or our shareholders;\n(41)\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal or interest due in respect of our indebtedness.\nThe indentures that govern our Senior Notes, and our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions will affect, and in many respects will limit or prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock, make investments or acquisitions, create liens and enter into mergers, consolidations or transactions with affiliates. The terms of our indebtedness also restrict our ability to sell certain assets, apply the proceeds of such sales and reinvest in our business.\nCertain of the agreements governing our indebtedness have covenants that require us to maintain prescribed financial ratios and tests. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in events of default and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance. Our performance, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, legislative, regulatory, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized. Over the next several years, we will require financing to refinance maturing debt obligations (unless extended), and such refinancing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nIn addition, certain of our credit facilities use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing borrowing rates. In July 2017, the United Kingdom regulator that regulates LIBOR announced its intention to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported during or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. While our credit facilities generally include provisions for the determination of a successor benchmark, any discontinuation of LIBOR after 2021 and the replacement with an alternative reference rate may adversely impact interest rates and our cost of borrowing.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to credit markets, increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including our Senior Notes.\nWe are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\nInterest on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at \u201cfloating\u201d rates. As a result, increases in interest rates will increase our costs of borrowing and reduce our operating margins.\nRisks Related to Macro-economic Conditions\nA weakening of the global economy, including capital and credit markets, could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nAs demand for our products has principally historically been determined by general global macro-economic activities, demand and prices for our products have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns. A significant economic downturn may affect our sales and profitability. Further, our suppliers and customers may\n(42)\nalso be adversely affected by an economic downturn. Additionally, restricted credit and capital availability restrains our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our products, resulting in lower revenues. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to raise capital, if needed, and otherwise negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIn addition, financial uncertainties and other events in our major international markets, including uncertainties arising as a result of global pandemics, may negatively impact the global economy and consequently, our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have manufacturing operations in Germany and Canada. Most of the operating costs and expenses of our German mills are incurred in euros and those of our Canadian mills in Canadian dollars. However, the majority of our sales are in products quoted in dollars. Our results of operations and financial condition are reported in dollars. As a result, our costs generally benefit from a strengthening dollar but are adversely affected by a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and to the Canadian dollar. Such declines in the dollar relative to the euro and the Canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the cash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, while a strengthening dollar generally lowers our costs and expenses, it increases the cost of pulp to our customers and generally puts downward pressure on pulp prices and reduces our energy, chemical and European lumber sales revenues as they are sold in euros and Canadian dollars.\nAlthough we report in dollars, we hold certain assets and liabilities, including our mills, in euros and Canadian dollars. We translate foreign denominated assets and liabilities into dollars at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated using historical exchange rates. Unrealized gains or losses from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and do not affect our net earnings, operating income or Operating EBITDA.\nCertain intercompany dollar advances between Mercer Inc. and its foreign subsidiaries are held in euros and Canadian dollars. Mercer Inc. holds some cash in foreign currencies and certain foreign subsidiaries hold some cash and other balances in dollars. When such advances, cash and other balances are translated into the applicable local currency at the end of each reporting period, the gains or losses thereon are reflected in net earnings.\nPolitical uncertainty and an increase in trade protectionism could have a material adverse effect on global macro-economic activities and trade and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe rise of economic nationalist sentiments and trade protectionism has led to increasing political uncertainty and unpredictability throughout the world. The United Kingdom has departed from the European Union and currently there is no certainty as to the overall effect on European and world economies. The U.S. previously imposed various tariffs on various goods from various countries, including China. Although there has been a partial first phase trade deal between the United States and China, there can be no certainty whether any further trade deals or relaxation or elimination of trade tariffs will occur or upon what terms. Additionally, there can be no assurance that additional or new trade tensions and tariffs will not arise between various trade partners including, among others, the United States and China. These potential developments, market perceptions concerning these and related issues and the attendant regulatory uncertainty regarding, for example, the posture of governments with respect to international trade, could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic growth which, in turn, can adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIncreased trade protectionism could materially adversely affect our business. If the current global economy or outlook is undermined by downside risks and there is a prolonged economic downturn, governments may resort to new or enhanced trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against imports, thereby depressing demand. Changes in the trade policies of the U.S. and other countries, such as the announcement of unilateral tariffs on imported products, have already triggered retaliatory actions from affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars\u201d that could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic growth.\n(43)\nProtectionist developments, or the perception they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Increasing trade protectionism in the markets could increase the risks associated with exporting goods to such markets. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage or operate our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as well as permits, guidelines and policies relating to the protection of the environment. These laws, regulations, permits, guidelines and policies govern, among other things:\n\u2022\nunlawful discharges to land, air, water and sewers;\n\u2022\nwaste collection, storage, transportation and disposal;\n\u2022\nhazardous waste;\n\u2022\ndangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection, storage, transportation and disposal of such substances;\n\u2022\nthe clean-up of unlawful discharges;\n\u2022\nland use planning;\n\u2022\nmunicipal zoning; and\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety.\nIn addition, as a result of our operations, we may be subject to remediation, clean-up or other administrative orders or amendments to our operating permits, and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries. Future orders, proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing. New regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive, at times requiring the replacement, enhancement or modification of equipment, facilities or operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements.\n(44)\nWe are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate, including damage to neighboring landowners, residents or employees, particularly as a result of the contamination of soil, groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water. The costs of such liabilities can be substantial. Our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities. We may also be subject to liability for any offsite environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport, treat or dispose of at other locations. In addition, we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired. Except for Stendal, our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent any such environmental contamination exists. As a result, these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent, including liabilities arising from non-compliance with environmental laws by prior owners. Because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability, any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures as a result of complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nFurther, enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations might require significant capital expenditures. We may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures.\nWe participate in German statutory energy programs.\nIn Germany, our Stendal and Friesau mills sell surplus green energy at fixed prices or tariffs pursuant to the Renewable Energy Act. Effective January 1, 2017, the German government amended the Renewable Energy Act so that funding for renewable energy is to be allocated through an auction system, primarily to create a competitive bidding process for new installations of wind, solar and biomass energy. Our Stendal mill\u2019s tariff expires in 2024 and Friesau mill's tariff expires in 2029. Our Rosenthal mill's initial 20-year tariff expired on December 31, 2020. In 2020, the German government proposed measures that would have, among other things, extended the time period that such tariffs would be available for pulp mills. However, such measures did not come into effect. As a result, commencing January 1, 2021, our Rosenthal mill started selling its power at market rates which fluctuate over time. As a result of, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic reducing power demand generally in Germany, market rates are currently materially lower than the prior prescribed special tariff. The German government has publicly announced that it will seek to further incentivize green energy production at pulp mills through additional measures in 2021.\nThe availability of tariffs and other incentives for our green energy production activities is dependent, to a large extent, on political and policy developments relating to environmental concerns in the regions in which we operate. We cannot currently predict the scope of any such measures whether they will provide similar economic incentives as under the tariffs, when, if at all, they will be implemented or their potential application and impact on our Rosenthal mill and, on the expiry of their existing tariffs in 2024 and 2029, respectively, our Stendal and Friesau mills.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a result of our international sales and operations, we are subject to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States, Canada and other governments or organizations, including prohibitions in the United States against foreign competitors\u2019 (including our operating subsidiaries) receipt of certain unlawful foreign governmental benefits. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Changes in trade sanction laws could restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, the imposition of tariffs or duties and other penalties, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Shares\n(45)\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nour growth rate and our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe financial market and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations.\nIn addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and would divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nA small number of our shareholders could significantly influence our business.\nThere are a few significant shareholders of our common stock who own a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock. These few significant shareholders, either individually or acting together, may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the company or our assets. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other shareholders to effect substantial changes in the company, may have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of the company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the possibility that one or more of these significant shareholders may sell all or a large portion of their common stock in a short period of time could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Also, the interests of these few shareholders may not be in the best interests of all shareholders.", "PERMNO": 75578, "SIC": 2611, "TIC": "MERC"}
