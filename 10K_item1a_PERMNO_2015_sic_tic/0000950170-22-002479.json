{"cik": "1354327", "company": "PGT Innovations, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors included herein are grouped into risks related to:\n\u2022 the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 Our Business Operations;\n\u2022 Demand for Our Products;\n\u2022 Acquisitions;\n\u2022 Our Indebtedness;\n\u2022 Information Systems and Intellectual Property; and\n\u2022 Warranty, Legal and Regulatory Matters\nMoreover, other factors may adversely affect our results of operations, including potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events, many of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors. Any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, among other risks, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic (the \u201cPandemic\u201d) was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). The Pandemic has resulted in a significant number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths in several of our key markets, including Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. The Pandemic has significantly affected economic conditions in those markets, and in the United States in general, and internationally, including due to federal, state and local governments and employers reacting to the public health crisis with mitigation measures, and also due to the general fear and uncertainty created by the Pandemic, all of which has resulted in workforce, supply chain and production disruptions, along with reduced demand and spending in many industries and markets. Although many of the government-mandated restrictions on economic and social activities that were put in place as part of the initial response to the Pandemic have been lifted, and vaccines with high degrees of efficacy have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, it is still uncertain when or if the nation-wide program of vaccination will result in herd immunity to COVID-19 in the United States or globally. This uncertainty is being impacted by several factors, including vaccine hesitancy or resistance, and the emergence of the highly-contagious strains of COVID-19 known as the Delta and Omicron variants. As a result, it is still currently unclear when, or if, social, business, occupational, educational and economic conditions will return to pre-Pandemic conditions.\nThe extent to which the continuing circumstances around the Pandemic could affect our future business, operations and financial results will depend upon numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the timing of any relief that may come from the current program of nationwide vaccinations and its effect on the duration of the continuing economic and market disruptions related to the Pandemic, and whether such vaccines are effective against any current and new variants of coronavirus, and the nature, amounts and duration of any additional government stimulus measures designed to bolster the economy. As such, we continue to be unable to accurately predict the impact the Pandemic and the challenges it has created for the U.S. and global economies, will have on our financial performance and operations going forward due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, when or if herd immunity is achieved in the United States, especially in our key markets, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to attempt to control the Pandemic, the impact to our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019\n- 13 -\nbusinesses and other factors identified below. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the Pandemic to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. Such other detrimental impacts that we could experience might include the following:\n\u2022complete or partial closures of, or other operational challenges at, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, resulting from government action, labor shortages, suppliers being unable to provide us with materials, or our voluntary actions to protect the health and safety of our team members;\n\u2022difficulty sourcing materials we require to fulfill production needs or higher prices being charged to us for those materials, as a result of suppliers experiencing closures or reductions in their production capacity or utilization levels;\n\u2022economic challenges, contractions or recession unfavorably impacting our customers\u2019 financial condition and liquidity, reducing their ability or desire to purchase additional products from us and increasing the likelihood they may need additional time to pay us or that they fail to pay us at all, which could significantly increase the amount of accounts receivable and the aging of those accounts and require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022economic challenges and contractions, including high unemployment rates, and reduced economic activity in general, resulting in a lengthy recession, which could negatively impact consumer purchases and spending for our products;\n\u2022difficulty accessing debt or equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, due to an unfavorable change in our credit ratings, and/or a severe disruption or instability in capital and financial markets, or deterioration in other conditions that impact our ability to access capital needed to fund business operations or to address other capital requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022our inability to comply with financial covenants under our debt agreements and notes indentures, which could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness; and\n\u2022the health and availability of our team members, particularly if a significant number of them or their family members are impacted by COVID-19, or variants thereof, which could disrupt our business continuity during the continuing Pandemic.\nIf any one or more of those impacts are sustained, they could have accounting consequences such as impairments of the goodwill and/or additional impairments of trade names of our reporting units and could seriously disrupt our operations and sales for extended periods. The adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations of any of the matters described above could be material.\nThe extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including any goodwill or additional trade name impairment or other asset impairments to our business segments as described in this Report, will depend largely on future developments, including the severity and duration of the outbreak in the U.S., whether there are additional or other meaningful increases in the number, variants or severity of COVID-19 cases in future periods, and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending and on our customers, suppliers and labor force, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe depend on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to operate our business and are subject to government regulations concerning these and our other employees, including wage and hour regulations, and we may be required to increase the wages we pay in order to attract, hire and retain hourly employees needed to manufacture our products and otherwise conduct our operations, and we may not be able to recover that increase in labor costs through increasing the prices we charge for our products or otherwise.\nOur workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, or our inability to attract and retain them, including due to government stimulus payments or enhanced unemployment benefits enacted in response to the Pandemic, or us having to increase wages paid to new and/or to current employees to attract, hire and/or retain the labor resources necessary to conduct our operations, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our\n- 14 -\nemployees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and payroll taxes, overtime and working conditions and immigration status. Accordingly, federal, state or locally legislated increases in the minimum wage, such as the passage of Florida\u2019s \u201cAmendment 2\u201d minimum wage law in November 2020, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, would increase our labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the prices of our raw materials which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe experience significant fluctuations in the cost of our raw materials, including glass, aluminum extrusion, vinyl extrusion, and polyvinyl butyral. We anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in the future. A variety of factors over which we have no control, including global demand for aluminum, fluctuations in oil prices, speculation in commodities futures, tariffs and the creation of new laminates or other products based on new technologies impact the cost of raw materials that we purchase for the manufacture of our products. These factors may also magnify the impact of economic cycles on our business. Although we endeavor from time to time to hedge the risks of fluctuations in the prices of our raw materials, we cannot guarantee that we will always be able to successfully minimize our risk through such actions.\nWe rely on a limited number of outside suppliers for certain key components and materials.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our key raw materials, such as glass, aluminum and vinyl extrusion components, from a few key suppliers, and obtain the polyvinyl butyral interlayers used in certain of our products from a sole supplier. If any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under present or any future supply agreements, or if those supply agreements are terminated, we may not be able to obtain certain raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may suffer a significant interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, including because it may be difficult to find substitute or alternate suppliers as the glass, interlayers and aluminum and vinyl extrusions we use are customized. A supplier may also choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship due to general economic concerns or concerns relating to the supplier or us, at any time. These modifications could include requirements from our suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or letters of credit.\nIn addition, while our business does not currently rely heavily on international suppliers or sales, significant disruptions in global economic conditions, travel or trade, including as a result of contagious disease events, such as the Pandemic, may have material adverse impacts on our supply chain. Furthermore, some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces, and strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of their facilities, which may impact our ability to fulfil orders or increase our costs.\nAny interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we are required to obtain an alternate source for these materials or components, we may not be able to obtain pricing on as favorable terms or on terms comparable to our competitors. Additionally, we may be forced to pay additional transportation costs or to invest in capital projects or costly product redesigns and perform costly new product certification testing with respect to our impact-resistant products, in connection with moving to any alternate source of supply.\nWe could experience a delay between the increased cost to us to obtain these raw materials, and our ability to increase the price of our products. If we are unable to pass on significant cost increases to our customers, our results of operations between periods may be negatively impacted. Any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers or any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.\nEconomic and credit market conditions impact our ability to collect receivables.\nEconomic and credit conditions can negatively impact our bad debt expense, which can adversely impact our results of operations. Some of the markets we serve, which includes dealers whose customers are second and vacation home owners in the repair and remodeling sector, are more sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions. If economic and credit conditions deteriorate, we may experience difficulties collecting on our accounts receivable, increasing our days sales outstanding and base debts owed to us, which could adversely impact our results of operations and business.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly competitive and we have experienced increased competition in our core market of Florida.\nThe window and door industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from numerous small, regional producers, as well as certain national producers. Furthermore, the impact-resistant window and door market in our primary market of Florida has recently attracted domestic and foreign competitors. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than do we, (ii) develop products that are superior to our products, (iii) have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost or compete more aggressively in pricing, or (iv) adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements\n- 15 -\nthan do we. Additionally, some of the competitors of our businesses are larger and have greater financial and other resources and less debt than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries and markets in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we have. Moreover, barriers to entry are low in most product lines and new competitors may enter our industry, especially if the market for impact-resistant windows and doors continues to expand. An increase in competition, including in the form of aggressive pricing by new market entrants and offerings of alternative building materials, could cause us to lose customers and lead to decreases in net sales and profitability if we are not able to respond adequately to such challenges. To the extent we lose customers in the renovation and remodeling markets, we would likely have to market more to the new home construction market, which historically has experienced more significant fluctuations in demand.\nWe operate our own fleet of trucks, which we reply on to a great extent for distribution of our products. But we also rely, and expect to continue to rely on third-party transportation, which subjects us to risks and costs that we cannot control, and which risks and costs may materially adversely affect our profitability.\nAlthough we operate a fleet of trucks which we rely on to a great extent for the distribution of our products, we also rely, and expect to continue to rely on third party trucking companies to transport raw materials to the manufacturing facilities used by each of our businesses and to ship finished products to customers. These transport operations are subject to various hazards and risks, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages and operating hazards, as well as interstate transportation regulations. In addition, the methods of transportation we utilize may be subject to additional, more stringent and more costly regulations in the future. If we are delayed or unable to ship finished products or unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any such new regulations or public policy changes related to transportation safety, or these transportation companies fail to operate properly, or if there were significant changes in the cost of these services due to new or additional regulations, or otherwise, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship goods, which could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and costs of operations. Transportation costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. If our transportation costs increased substantially, due to prolonged increases in fuel prices or otherwise, we may not be able to control them or pass the increased costs onto customers, which may materially adversely affect our profitability.\nSales fluctuations to and changes in our relationships with key customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nSome of our business lines and markets are dependent on a few key customers, including dealers. We generally do not enter into written or long-term agreements with our customers. The loss, reduction, or fluctuation of sales to one of these major customers, or any adverse change in our business relationship with any one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nSome of our key customers are companies that have experienced and may continue to experience consolidation in their ownership or expand through internal growth. Consolidation could decrease the number of potential customers for our products and increase our reliance on key customers. Further, any increase in the ownership concentration or size of our key customers could result in our key customers seeking more favorable terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us. Accordingly, any increase in ownership concentration of our key customers or other increases in the size of our customers may further limit our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers, because we provide credit to our customers in the normal course of business. All of our customers are sensitive to economic changes and to the cyclical nature of the building industry. Especially during protracted or severe economic declines and cyclical downturns in the building industry, our customers may be unable to perform on their payment obligations, including their debts to us. Any failure by our customers to meet their obligations to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we may incur increased expenses related to collections in the future if we find it necessary to take legal action to enforce the contractual obligations of a significant number of our customers.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries and rely on payments from our subsidiaries to meet all of our obligations.\nWe are a holding company and derive all of our operating income from our subsidiary, PGT Industries, Inc., and its subsidiaries, CGI, WinDoor, WWS Acquisition, LLC, doing business as Western Window Systems, as well as from the entities acquired in the NewSouth Window Solutions acquisition, our 75% stake in New Holding and its related ECO entities, and the entities acquired in the Anlin Acquisition. All of our assets are held by our subsidiaries, and we rely on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us will depend on their respective operating\n- 16 -\nresults and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdictions of organization, which may limit the amount of funds available for distributions to us, the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of our subsidiaries, including our credit facilities and indenture, and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.\nRisks Related to Demand for Our Products\nWe are subject to regional and national economic conditions that may negatively impact demand for our products.\nThe window and door industry is subject to many economic factors. Changes in macroeconomic conditions in our core markets including Florida, with respect to our impact-resistant products, and in the western U.S., including California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, with respect to our WWS products designed to unify indoor and outdoor living spaces, as well as throughout the U.S. generally, could negatively impact demand for our products and macroeconomic forces, such as employment rates and the availability of credit could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. In addition, the window and door industry is subject to the cyclical market pressures of the larger new construction and repair and remodeling markets. A decline in the economic environment or new home construction, as well as any other adverse changes in economic conditions, including demographic trends, employment levels, interest rates, and consumer confidence, could result in a decline in demand for, or adversely affect the pricing of, our products, which in turn could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nChanges in weather patterns, including as a result of global climate change, could significantly affect demand for our products, and thus, our sales and our financial results or financial condition.\nWeather patterns may affect our operating results and our ability to maintain our sales volume throughout the year. Because our dealers\u2019 customers, and the homeowners and builders who are customers of NewSouth Window Solutions and Western Window Systems, along with the customers of Eco\u2019s dealers, depend on suitable weather to engage in new construction and repair and remodel projects, increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could result in a decrease in the demand for our products for periods of inclement weather, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results or financial condition. For example, unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary amounts of rainfall may decrease construction activity, thereby decreasing demand for our products and our sales during that period of time. Alternatively, extreme weather, such as hurricanes, has historically increased the visibility of our brands and customers\u2019 demand for our impact-resistant products. Therefore, the lack of hurricane-related extreme weather conditions in a given year or over a period of time could result in a decrease of our sales and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Weather patterns are difficult to predict and may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, including climate change, and we cannot guarantee that extreme weather conditions will or will not occur. Also, we cannot predict the effects that global climate change may have on our business. In addition to changes in weather patterns, climate change could, for example, reduce the demand for construction, and increase the cost and reduce the availability of construction materials, raw materials and energy. New laws and regulations related to global climate change may also increase our expenses or reduce our sales.\nOur operating results are substantially dependent on demand for our branded impact-resistant products, contemporary indoor/outdoor window and door systems and factory-direct, energy-efficient residential windows and doors.\nA majority of our net sales are derived from the sales of our branded impact-resistant products and on window and door systems for residential, commercial and multi-family markets. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend largely on the demand for our impact-resistant products by current and future customers, especially in the State of Florida, where the majority of our impact resistant products are made and sold. Our future operating results also will depend on demand for the contemporary indoor/outdoor window and door systems sold by our Western Window Systems business. Sales generated by our NewSouth business depend on a direct-to-consumer model and is supported by showrooms and in-home sales. Consequently, a portion of our future operating results are reliant on current and future customer demand for factory-direct, energy-efficient residential windows and doors. If our competitors release new products that are superior to our products in performance or price, or if we fail to update our impact-resistant products with any technological advances that are developed by us or our competitors or introduce new products in a timely manner, demand for our products may decline. In addition, the window and door industry can be subject to changing trends and consumer preferences. If we do not correctly gauge consumer trends for the various products and systems we offer and respond appropriately, customers may not purchase our products and our brand names may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands or product designs to be outdated or associate our brands or product designs with styles that are no longer popular. Any of these outcomes could create significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products, which would have a material adverse effect on our brands, our business, results of operations and financial condition. A decline in demand for our impact-resistant products, our contemporary indoor/outdoor window and door systems or our direct-to-consumer, energy-efficient residential windows and doors as a result of competition, technological change, changes in consumer preferences or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales, which could materially negatively affect our results of operations.\n- 17 -\nOur business is subject to seasonal industry patterns and demand for our products, and thus our revenue and profit, can vary significantly throughout the year, which may adversely impact the timing of our cash flows and limit our liquidity at certain times of the year.\nOur business is seasonal, and our net revenues and operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the timing of the building season in our markets. Our sales typically follow seasonal new construction and the repair and remodel industry patterns. Additionally, events like preparation for hurricane season and rebuilding and repairs in the months following a hurricane in the majority of the geographies where we market and sell our products generally creates peak demand for our products and resulting sale volumes during the quarters in which those activities occur. Other quarterly sales volumes might be generally lower due to reduced repair and remodeling and new construction activity as a result of less favorable climate conditions in the majority of our geographic end markets. Failure to effectively manage our demand and production planning, inventory and overall operations in anticipation of or in response to seasonal fluctuations or changing seasonal fluctuations as a result of climate change, could negatively impact our liquidity profile during certain seasonal periods.\nChanges in building codes could reduce the demand for our impact-resistant windows and doors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe market for our impact-resistant windows and doors depends in large part on our ability to satisfy state and local building codes that require protection from wind-borne debris. If the standards in such building codes become more stringent, we may not be able to meet their requirements, and demand for our products could decline. Conversely, if the standards in such building codes are lowered or are not enforced in certain areas because of industry lobbying or otherwise, demand for our impact-resistant products may decrease. In addition, if states and regions that are affected by hurricanes but do not currently have such building codes fail to adopt and enforce hurricane protection building codes, our ability to expand our business in such markets may be limited. We are also subject to energy efficiency codes and performance standards in Colorado, California and other states where we operate, several of which are more stringent than those to which we have historically been subject. Any such changes in building codes or energy efficiency codes could lower the demand for our impact-resistant windows and doors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe homebuilding industry and the home repair and remodeling sector are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Increased regulatory restrictions could limit demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling products and could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the loss of sales or market share if we are unable to keep up with demand.\nWe are currently experiencing growth through higher sales volume and growth in market share. To meet the increased demand, we have been hiring and training new employees for direct and indirect support and adding to our glass capacity. However, should we be unable to find and retain quality employees to meet demand, or should there be disruptions to the increase in capacity for the raw materials needed to produce our products, we may be unable to keep up with our higher sales demand. If our lag time on delivery falls behind, or we are unable to meet customer timing demands, we could lose market share to competitors.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nOur recently completed acquisitions may result in, or involve activities that cause, distractions to our management team, increased expenses or unanticipated liabilities.\nAs a result of our acquisitions of NewSouth, Western Windows Systems, 75% ownership stake in Eco, CRi SoCal, Inc., and Anlin, we have significantly more sales, assets and employees than we did prior to the transactions, which may require our management to devote a significant amount of time, resources and attention to the new product offerings or novel challenges, and/or away from the operations of our historical windows and doors business. These potential diversions and distractions may result in, or involve activities that cause, increased expenses and unanticipated liabilities.\nAfter the Eco Acquisition, the Company is the majority shareholder of Eco, and our interest in Eco is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of businesses with a minority shareholder.\nPursuant to the acquisition agreement pursuant to which we acquired a 75% ownership stake in Eco, principal Eco equity-holder prior to our acquisition continues to hold 25% of the outstanding equity interests of Eco. Conducting a business with a minority investor may lead to one or more of the following circumstances, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to realize a profit on our equity interest in the Eco businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition:\n- 18 -\n\u2022our inability to control certain strategic, operational and financial decisions\u037e\n\u2022our having economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, those of the minority equity holder\u037e\n\u2022the inability of the minority equity holder to meet his financial and other obligations to Eco or third parties\u037e and\n\u2022litigation between the minority equity holder and us regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the acquisition agreement and/or the operating agreement we entered into with the minority equity holder, or the operations of Eco.\nThere can be no assurance that the Eco Acquisition will be beneficial to us, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable economic conditions, integration challenges or other factors.\nAll of the Eco entities in which we acquired a controlling interest are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under our existing senior secured credit facilities and indenture and are not subject to the restrictive covenants under such agreements.\nAll of the Eco entities in which we acquired a controlling interest have been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under our existing senior secured credit facilities and indenture. As a result, those entities are not subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture and are able to engage in many of the activities that we and our restricted subsidiaries are prohibited or limited from undertaking under the terms of the indenture. These actions, if undertaken by Eco, could be detrimental to our ability to make payments of principal and interest under the 2021 Senior Notes due 2029.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits from our recent acquisitions, including synergies, from acquisitions, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nAcquisitions may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our other businesses. If our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer and its liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. In addition, as we continue our integration activities, we may identify additional risks and uncertainties not yet known to us.\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate and position the business operations of our recent acquisitions and our legacy businesses, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits of the increased sales volume and other benefits, including synergies, that we expected to result from recent acquisitions, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from these recent acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. In addition, even if such acquisitions are successfully integrated, we may become subject to unexpected costs, charges or liabilities arising from such businesses. Our expected cost savings, as well as any revenue or other strategic synergies, are subject to significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. If we fail to realize the benefits, we anticipated from our recent acquisitions, our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely effected.\nWe may evaluate and engage in asset acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other transactions that may impact our results of operations, and we may not achieve the expected results from these transactions.\nFrom time to time, and subject to the agreements governing our then existing debt or otherwise, we may enter into agreements to and engage in business combinations, purchases of assets or contractual arrangements or joint ventures, including in geographical areas outside the state of Florida, with which we do not have the level of familiarity that we have with the Florida market. In addition, some of those business acquisitions or combinations could involve a seller whose products may be different from the types of products we currently sell, and they could be products that are sold to different types of customers. Subject to the agreements governing our then existing debt or otherwise, some of these transactions may be financed with additional borrowings. The integration of any business we may acquire may be disruptive to us and may result in a significant diversion of management attention and operational resources. Additionally, we may suffer a loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, loss of revenues, increases in costs or other difficulties. If the expected revenue enhancement plans, strategies, goals, efficiencies and synergies from any such transactions are not fully realized, our results of operations could be adversely affected, because of the costs associated with such transactions or otherwise. Other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of our businesses, thereby yielding increased short-term liquidity, but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term. In addition, if the goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future are determined to be impaired, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which\n- 19 -\ncould be significant. The failure to realize the expected long-term benefits of any one or more of these transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial condition and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nOur total gross indebtedness is $635.0 million, including $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes we issued on September 24, 2021, and we had an additional $74.7 million available for borrowing under our senior secured credit facilities.\nAlthough our senior secured credit facilities and indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThis high level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent of any future borrowings, including any borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the senior secured credit facilities and the notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the senior notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;\n- 20 -\n\u2022 pay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of our common stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022 make certain investments including potential acquisitions;\n\u2022 create certain liens;\n\u2022 enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of the senior secured credit facilities, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such action by the lenders could cause cross defaults under the indenture governing the notes. For a description of our senior secured credit facilities, see Footnote 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may be required to seek to obtain waivers from the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities or from the holders of other obligations, to avoid defaults thereunder. If we are not able to obtain such waivers, the lenders could exercise their rights upon default, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nFurthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under our senior secured credit facilities. If the lenders under senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior secured credit facilities and our other indebtedness, including the notes, or will have the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under the existing senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income could decrease. The applicable margin with respect to the loans under the senior secured credit facilities is a percentage per annum equal to a reference rate plus the applicable margin.\nFrom time to time in order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate and fixed for floating rate interest payments. If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps when necessary, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, a transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may affect the cost of servicing our debt under the existing senior secured credit facilities. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom ended LIBOR at the end of 2021. Although our borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates, the consequences of the phase out of LIBOR is not currently predictable. For example, use of a rate other than LIBOR as a means of calculating interest with respect to our outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest rates incurred, it could result in an increase in the cost of such indebtedness, impact our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\n- 21 -\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and there can be no assurance that any rating assigned by the rating agencies to our debt or our corporate rating will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital, which could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nRisks Related to Information Systems and Intellectual Property\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems or by unauthorized intrusions or \u201chacking\u201d into those systems and theft of confidential and sensitive information from them, or other cybersecurity-related incidents.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. A disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged period could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Various third parties, including computer hackers, who are continually becoming more aggressive and sophisticated, may attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential and sensitive customer, employee and/or supplier information. Such attempts may include malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, unauthorized access, human error, theft or misconduct. In addition, one of our employees, contractors or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss and theft, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data. Security breaches could also harm our reputation with our customers and retail partners, potentially leading to decreased revenues, and with federal and state government agencies and bodies.\nThe regulatory environment related to cybersecurity, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and frequently changing requirements, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. Our business and results of operations may be directly and adversely affected by future legislative, regulatory, or judicial actions. A significant compromise of confidential and sensitive employee, customer or supplier information in our possession could result in legal damages and regulatory fines and penalties. The costs associated with cybersecurity, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches and defend against any related actions, could be substantial and adversely impact our business.\nOperation on multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) information systems, and the conversion from multiple systems to a single system, may negatively impact our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our ERP information systems infrastructure in order to process orders, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, maintain regulatory compliance and otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. We currently operate on six different ERP information systems. Since we must process and reconcile our information from multiple systems, the chance of errors is increased, and we may incur significant additional costs related thereto. Inconsistencies in the information from multiple ERP systems could adversely impact our ability to manage our business efficiently and may result in heightened risk to our ability to maintain our books and records and comply with regulatory requirements. Any of\n- 22 -\nthe foregoing could result in a material increase in information technology compliance or other related costs and could materially negatively impact our operations. In the future, we may transition all or a portion of our systems to one ERP system. The transition to a different ERP system involves numerous risks, including:\nAny of the foregoing could result in a material increase in information technology compliance or other related costs and could materially negatively impact our operations.\nOther parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or may allege that we have infringed on theirs.\nCompetitors or other third parties may infringe on or otherwise make unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, including product designs, manufacturing practices, registered intellectual property and other rights. We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information. However, these measures may not prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violations of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. If we determine that such infringement or violation has occurred, legal action to enforce our rights may require us to spend significant amounts in legal costs, even if we ultimately prevail.\nConversely, given the nature of our business and product designs, competitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us, have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. Even though we believe such claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement or violations would be without merit, defending against such claims would be time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. Given the rapidly changing and highly competitive business environment in which we operate, and the increasingly complex designs of our products and other companies\u2019 similar products, the outcome of any contemplated intellectual property-related litigation would be difficult to predict and could cause us to lose significant revenue, to be prohibited from using the relevant designs, systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual property, to cease offering certain products or services or to incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses.\nRisks Related to Warranty, Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe nature of our business exposes us to product liability, warranty and other claims.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in product liability, product warranty and other claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we may be exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of homebuilders and home remodelers and their sub-contractors. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company.\nWe are subject to potential exposure to environmental liabilities and are subject to environmental regulation.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations. Although we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws, ordinances, and regulations, as owners and lessees of real property, we can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination on such properties, in some circumstances, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such contamination. Remediation may be required in the future as a result of spills or releases of petroleum products or hazardous substances, the discovery of unknown environmental conditions, or more stringent standards regarding existing residual contamination. More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our general and administrative costs and may increase the risk that we may incur fines or penalties or be held liable for violations of such regulatory requirements.\n- 23 -\nFrom time to time we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings which seek material damages from us. These proceedings may be negatively perceived by the public and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings from time to time which may result in material damages. Although we do not presently believe that any of our current legal or regulatory proceedings will ultimately have a material adverse impact on our financial performance or operations, we cannot assure you that we will not incur material damages or penalties in a lawsuit or other proceeding in the future and/or significant defense costs related to such lawsuits or regulatory proceedings. For example, many of our products are installed in large, multi-unit condominiums or apartments or similar developments, and we may face legal claims for breach of warranties or other claims alleging product defects on a large-scale in connection with such projects. Also, we operate a fleet of delivery trucks and, in addition to the significant compliance-related costs associated with operating such a fleet, we may incur significant adverse judgments, damages and penalties related to accidents that those trucks may be involved in from time to time. Significant adverse judgments, penalties, settlement amounts, amounts needed to post a bond pending an appeal or defense costs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. It is also possible that, as a result of a present or future governmental or other proceeding or settlement, significant restrictions will be placed upon, or significant changes made to, our business practices, operations or methods, including pricing or similar terms. Any such restrictions or changes may adversely affect our profitability or increase our compliance costs.\nOur Bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws (our \u201cBylaws\u201d) provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation\u2019s stockholders, (iii) an action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Corporation\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our exclusive forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis forum selection provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our certificate of incorporation, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.", "PERMNO": 91363, "SIC": 3442, "TIC": "PGTI"}
