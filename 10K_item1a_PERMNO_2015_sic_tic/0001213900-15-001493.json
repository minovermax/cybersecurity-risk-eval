{"cik": "1588869", "company": "Cambridge Capital Acquisition Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\tRISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. The description of the risks related to Parakou\u2019s industry and business contained in the Merger Form S-4 under the captions \u201cRisks Related to Parakou\u2019s Industry\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Parakou\u2019s Business\u201d, respectively, are incorporated herein by reference.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nWe are a newly formed blank check company in the development stage with no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a newly formed blank check company in the development stage with no operating results to date. Since we do not have an operating history, you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to acquire an operating business. We have not conducted any discussions and we have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective acquisition candidates. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of our initial business combination.\nIf we are unable to consummate our initial business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait until June 23, 2015 or later before receiving distributions from the trust account.\nWe will have until June 23, 2015 (or December 23, 2015 if we have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination by June 23, 2015 but the business combination has not been completed by that date) to consummate our initial business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate our initial business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert their shares. Only after the expiration of this full time period will holders of our common stock be entitled to distributions from the trust account if we are unable to complete our initial business combination. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares, potentially at a loss.\nThe proposed business combination with Parakou, if consummated, will result in a change of control of our ownership. Any other business combination we pursue may cause a change in control of our ownership.\nMr. Por Liu, Parakou\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will own approximately 37.9% of our outstanding common shares immediately after consummation of the Mergers (assuming that none of our stockholders exercise their conversion rights) and up to 42.5% of our outstanding common shares if all of the Earn Out or Share Price Targets are achieved in the next three years or a change in control occurs (assuming that none of our stockholders exercise their conversion rights).\nHowever, if the business combination with Parakou is not consummated, in connection with another business combination, we may issue a substantial number of shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock, to complete such business combination.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. There are currently 20,103,250 authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance (after reserving for shares issuable upon the exercise of our warrants outstanding and the exercise of the unit purchase option). We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete our initial business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\u25cf\nmay significantly reduce the equity interest of investors;\n\u25cf\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nmay cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\nWe may incur significant indebtedness in order to consummate our initial business combination.\nIf we find it necessary to incur significant indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, it could result in:\n\u25cf\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\n\u25cf\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding.\nThe funds held in the trust account may not earn significant interest and, as a result, we may be limited to the funds held outside of the trust account to fund our search for target businesses, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial business combination.\nOf the net proceeds of our IPO and simultaneous private placement, approximately $800,000 was available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to provide us with additional working capital we need to identify one or more target businesses and to complete our initial business combination, as well as to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. Interest rates on permissible investments for us have been less than 1% over the last several months. Accordingly since we have not earned a sufficient amount of interest on the funds held in the trust account and have used all of the funds held outside of the trust account, we will not have sufficient funds available with which to complete our merger with Parakou or to fund our search for a target business if the merger with Parakou is not consummated. We will likely need to borrow funds from our sponsors, officers or directors to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our sponsors, officers and directors are under no obligation to loan us any funds. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary, we may be forced to cease searching for a target business and may be unable to complete our initial business combination.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.10.\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, our executive officers have agreed that they will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. However, they may not be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the distribution from the trust account to each holder of shares of common stock may be less than $10.10, plus interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our holders of shares of common stock at least $10.10.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nIf we have not completed our initial business combination by June 23, 2015 (or December 23, 2015 if we have entered into a definitive agreement with a target business for a business combination by June 23, 2015 but the business combination has not been consummated by such date), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares of common stock, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the June 23, 2015 or December 23, 2015 deadline, as applicable, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public holders of common stock from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.\nIf we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, public holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the public warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holders exercised their warrants for cash. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company may be reduced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the private warrants and any other warrants that may be issued to our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates as described elsewhere in this annual report may be exercisable for unregistered shares of common stock for cash even if the prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not current and effective.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nOur public warrants are not exercisable for cash and we are not obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. At the time that the warrants become exercisable, we expect to continue to be listed on a national securities exchange, which would provide an exemption from registration in every state. Accordingly, we believe holders in every state will be able to exercise their warrants as long as our prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. If the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a way that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding warrants.\nOur warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding warrants (including the private warrants) in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Our sponsors own approximately 6% of the outstanding warrants. Therefore, we only need approval from holders of more than 45% of public warrants to amend the terms of the warrants.\nIf we do not complete the business combination with Parakou, since we are not limited to a particular industry or target business with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.\nIf we do not complete the business combination with Parakou, we may consummate an initial business combination with a company in any industry we choose and are not limited to any particular industry or type of business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete our initial business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. An investment in our shares may not ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business.\nThe requirement that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete such a business combination with.\nPursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. This restriction may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete a business combination with. Our board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Parakou.\nIf we are unable to locate a target business or businesses that satisfy this fair market value test, we may be forced to liquidate and you will only be entitled to receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account.\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may structure a business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our business combination with Parakou or another initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. None of our officers are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs (although we expect them to devote approximately 10 hours per week to our business) and, accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\nThe role of our key personnel after our initial business combination, however, remains to be determined. Although some of our key personnel may serve in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to acquire.\nWe may consummate a business combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. Our officers and directors may not have enough experience or sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding our initial business combination.\nIf the business combination with Parakou is not completed and we enter into a business combination with another target business, our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with another business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel have not entered into any employment or consulting agreements with us or Parakou in connection with the proposed business combination with Parakou. However, if the business combination with Parakou is not completed and we enter into a business combination with another target business, our key personnel will be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements or other appropriate arrangements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nOur officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. All of our officers and directors are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur officers and directors have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations and accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nOur officers and directors have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies, including companies that are engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial business combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business.\nThe shares beneficially owned by our officers and directors will not participate in liquidation distributions and, therefore, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors have waived their right to convert their insider shares, private shares or any other shares of common stock acquired, or to receive distributions with respect to their insider shares or private shares upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination. Accordingly, these securities will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial business combination. Their private warrants and any other warrants they acquire will also be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nNASDAQ may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities are listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange. However, our securities may not continue to be listed on NASDAQ in the future prior to an initial business combination. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, it is likely that NASDAQ will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. We may not be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nOn January 2, 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ that, as a result of our failure to hold an annual meeting, NASDAQ has determined to delist our securities from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ\u2019s determinations have not resulted in the immediate delisting of our securities and we have commenced an appeal of NASDAQ\u2019s determination.\nOn February 5, 2015, NASDAQ held a hearing to consider our appeal. On February 10, 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ that they granted our request for continued listing, assuming we have completed an initial business combination prior to July 1, 2015 and that we have demonstrated, on the earlier of July 20, 2015 or 20 days after the completion of an initial business combination, that we are in compliance with the initial listing standards of NASDAQ. If we fail to meet these requirements, our stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ stock market.\nIf NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf\na determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u25cf\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds in our trust account, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.\nWe will acquire a single target business, if the business combination with Parakou is completed. If the business combination with Parakou is not completed, we may still be only able to complete one business combination with the proceeds in our trust account. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\n\u25cf\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\nAlternatively, if the business combination with Parakou is not completed and we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIf the business combination with Parakou is not completed and another business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many public stockholders may exercise conversion rights, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our initial business combination. In the event that the acquisition involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us. In light of our mandatory liquidation date of June 23, 2015 or December 23, 2015, as applicable, the business combination with Parakou may be the only opportunity for us to complete our initial business combination.\nWe may be unable to consummate an initial business combination if a target business requires that we have a certain amount of cash at closing, in which case public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until our redemption of the public shares to receive a pro rata share of the trust account or attempt to sell their shares in the open market.\nIn connection with the business combination with Parakou, each public stockholder (but not our sponsors, officers or directors) has the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash (subject to limitations) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against the business combination. We will consummate the business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock issued in our initial public offering voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In addition, it is a condition to the consummation of the business combination that after giving effect to the exercise of conversion rights by our stockholders, we shall have at least $50,000,000 of cash in our trust account. Accordingly, if public stockholders owning more than 3,084,481 shares (as of December 31, 2014) of our common stock exercise their conversion rights, we would not be able to satisfy this condition.\nPublic stockholders that fail to vote either in favor of or against a proposed business combination will not be able to have his shares converted to cash.\nIn order for a public stockholder to have his shares converted to cash in connection with any proposed business combination, that public stockholder must vote either in favor of or against a proposed business combination. If a public stockholder fails to vote in favor of or against a proposed business combination, whether that stockholder abstains from the vote or simply does not vote, that stockholder would not be able to have his shares of common stock so converted to cash.\nPublic stockholders, together with any affiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup,\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our public offering.\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve an initial business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsors, officers or directors) the right to have his, her, or its shares of common stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of common stock. Generally, in this context, a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such stockholders agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly, if you purchase more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our public offering and our proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional shares of common stock or sell them in the open market. The value of such additional shares may not appreciate over time following our initial business combination, and the market price of our shares of common stock may not exceed the per-share conversion price.\nWe are requiring public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nIn connection with the special stockholder meeting to be called to approve the proposed initial business combination with Parakou (or, if we are unable to complete our business combination with Parakou, another business combination for which we seek shareholder approval), each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination, to demand that we convert his shares of common stock into a share of the trust account. We are requiring public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time prior to the vote taken at the stockholder meeting relating to such business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\nWe will require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements for conversion. As such, converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination with Parakou is not approved.\nWe will require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with specific delivery requirements for conversion described above and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\nIf the business combination with Parakou is not consummated, because of our limited resources and structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.\nIf the business combination with Parakou is not consummated, we expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including private equity funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that if the business combination with Parakou is not consummated there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the proceeds in our trust account, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources and our mandatory liquidation date. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval of our initial business combination may delay the consummation of a transaction. Additionally, our outstanding warrants and unit purchase option, and the future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.\nOur ability to consummate an attractive business combination may be impacted by the market for initial public offerings.\nOur efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although it is very likely that our target will want to be a public reporting company. If the market for initial public offerings is limited, we believe there will be a greater number of attractive target businesses open to being acquired by us as a means to achieve publicly held status. Alternatively, if the market for initial public offerings is robust, we believe that there will be fewer attractive target businesses amenable to being acquired by us to become a public reporting company. Accordingly, during periods with strong public offering markets, it may be more difficult for us to complete an initial business combination.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.\nThe Merger Agreement provides, as a condition to Parakou\u2019s obligation to consummate the business combination, that Cambridge must maintain at least $50,000,000 in net tangible assets, after giving effect to the exercise of conversion rights by our public stockholders. If we fail to satisfy the foregoing condition and Parakou does not waive this requirement, Parakou may terminate the Merger Agreement. If, because of payments made to converting stockholders, we fail to maintain a balance of at least $50,000,000 in net tangible assets, and Parakou waives the condition that we maintain the minimum amount of cash in our trust account, Parakou may need to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financing. In addition, if the business combination with Parakou is not completed, we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular future transaction. We may be required to seek additional financing to complete any such transaction. Financing may not be available to us or Parakou, as applicable, on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.\nOur sponsors, including our officers and directors, will control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nOur sponsors, including our officers and directors, collectively own approximately 23.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Our chief executive officer has indicated his intention to purchase shares on the open market. Through February 26, 2015, he has purchased 5,000 shares of our common stock. None of our other sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase any units or shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions, to the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, our sponsors, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before this offering as well as the private shares and any shares of common stock acquired in this offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination.\nOur board of directors is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. It is unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. Accordingly, public stockholders will not be able to exercise their voting rights under corporate law until after the consummation of an initial business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, fewer than half of the board of directors will be considered for election and our sponsors, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our sponsors will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of our initial business combination.\nWe may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination.\nIn connection with our proposed business combination with Parakou we plan to hold a special meeting of stockholders concurrent with an annual meeting of stockholders. However, with any other business combination, in accordance with NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on NASDAQ. Under Section 211(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. It is unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nIf we determine to change our acquisition criteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this annual report would be rendered irrelevant and you would be investing in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nFor our proposed business combination with Parakou, their business is consistent with our previously disclosed acquisition criteria and guidelines. And, to give further guidance to investors, we have included an investor presentation as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed on December 2, 2014. We could seek to deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines disclosed in this annual report although we have no current intention to do so. For instance, as required by NASDAQ rules, we currently anticipate acquiring a target business that has a fair market value that is at least equal to 80% of the balance of the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for a business combination. However, we could be delisted from NASDAQ and therefore no longer be required to meet this requirement. Furthermore, there are numerous agreements between us and third parties that could be amended between the parties without approval of public stockholders. In such event, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this annual report would be rendered irrelevant. Accordingly, investors may be making an investment in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nOur outstanding warrants and unit purchase option may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 8,522,125 shares of common stock as part of the units offered by our public offering and private placement. We may also issue additional units (including warrants) to our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates upon conversion of promissory notes issued to such persons for loans made to supplement our working capital requirements, as described elsewhere in this annual report. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants and unit purchase option may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe may redeem the warrants at a time that is not beneficial to public investors.\nWe may call the public warrants for redemption at any time after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this annual report have been satisfied. If we call the public warrants for redemption, public stockholders may be forced to accept a nominal redemption price or sell or exercise the warrants when they may not wish to do so.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this annual report have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant (including any warrants held by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nIf our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect our initial business combination.\nOur sponsors are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the insider shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the purchasers of the private units and our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us commencing on the date that we consummate our initial business combination. The presence of these additional securities trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act of 1940. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in United States government treasury bills, notes or bonds having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination, including:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf\nregistration as an investment company;\n\u25cf\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination by December 23, 2015 may give the current owner of Parakou, or if not Parakou, another target business leverage over us in consummating our initial business combination.\nWe have until June 23, 2015 (or December 23, 2015 if we have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination by June 23, 2015 but the business combination has not been completed by that date) to complete our initial business combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nWe have obtained a fairness opinion in regards to our proposed business combination with Parakou from SC&H Capital an independent investment banking firm. However, if the business combination with Parakou is not completed, we will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsors. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain an opinion. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nWe may not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm as to the fair market value of the target business we are seeking to acquire.\nWe have obtained an opinion from SC&H Capital, an independent investment banking firm, as to the fair market value of Parakou. However, if the business combination with Parakou is not complete, we will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value of such target business if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in valuing such target business or businesses, and our board of directors may not properly value such target business or businesses.\nResources could be spent researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nIt is anticipated that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to complete a specific business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate the business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require that we have such system of internal controls audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management\u2019s evaluation of our system of internal controls. Parakou is not currently subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, following the Mergers, we will be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parakou, or a different target company if the business combination with Parakou is not consummated, may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of Parakou or any subsequent such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, will not adopt the new or revised standard until the time private companies are required to adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nIf we consummate our initial business combination with Parakou or another company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nWe may consummate our initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business\u2019 home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\n\u25cf\nrules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u25cf\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u25cf\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf\ncultural and language differences;\n\u25cf\nemployment regulations;\n\u25cf\ncrime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\n\u25cf\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we are unable to do so, our operations may suffer.\nIf we consummate our initial business combination with Parakou or another target business located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such target business will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIf we consummate our initial business combination with a target business located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such target business is domiciled will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. The target business may not be able to enforce any of its material agreements in such jurisdiction and appropriate remedies to enforce its rights under such material agreements may not be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only one-third of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our \u201cstaggered board\u201d may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Moreover, our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we will not be able to complete our initial business combination with prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. Additionally, to the extent we furnish our stockholders with financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d), such financial statements will need to be audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the time of the consummation of the business combination. In our Merger Form S-4, we have provided financial statements of Parakou prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited under PCAOB standards. However if we are unable to complete the business combination with Parakou, these financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSupply Chain Industry Risks\nBusiness combinations with companies with operations in the supply chain industry entail special considerations and risks. If we are successful in completing a business combination with a target business with operations in the supply chain industry, we will be subject to, and possibly adversely affected by, the following risks:\n\u25cf\nincreased costs or decreased availability of third-party providers of certain transportation services;\n\u25cf\nthe negative impacts of catastrophic events;\n\u25cf\ncompetition and consolidation of the specific sector of the supply chain management industry within which the target business operates;\n\u25cf\nobtaining the necessary insurance coverage for the target business\u2019 operations;\n\u25cf\nincreased government regulations in the supply chain management industry, including with respect to, among other matters, increased anti-terrorism measures and handling of regulated waste, and the costs of compliance with such regulations; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in demands for outsourcing supply chain management activities.\nAny of the foregoing could have a negative adverse impact on our operations following a business combination.\nHowever, our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular industry. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these risks will likely not affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or target business which we acquire, none of which can be presently ascertained.", "PERMNO": 14421, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CAMB"}
