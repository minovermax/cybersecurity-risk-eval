RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Economic and Political Conditions\nImpacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including how it has and will impact our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors and business partners. The COVID-19 global pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which may continue to affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has caused certain disruptions to our business and operations and could cause material disruptions to our business and operations in the future as a result of, among other things, quarantines, worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors, social distancing measures and other travel, health-related, business or other restrictions. The effects of the pandemic have created and exacerbated challenges with the attraction and retention of talent.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers and customers. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic our ability to obtain products or services from certain suppliers and to operate at certain locations have been and may continue to be impacted. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations have been adversely impacted and could be materially adversely affected if the COVID-19 global pandemic continues or there are resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants.\nVaccine mandates and testing requirements have been announced in jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, certain customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our employees who provide on-site service at customer facilities. Our efforts to comply with these mandates, including requiring that some or all of our employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, could result in increased labor attrition and disruption, as well as difficulty securing future labor needs, and could adversely impact our ability to deliver services to our U.S. federal government customers and potentially other customers, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus and its variants including distribution and administration of available vaccines through mandates or otherwise, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nThe ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. In addition, the rapidly changing situation could give rise to additional risks or adverse impacts of which we are not presently aware, such as the ability to complete acquisitions, the ability to obtain credit through the capital markets and/or through our revolving credit facility. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economic and political environment as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 20% of our net revenues and 14% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were attributable to operations outside the U.S. We expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. Our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the U.S. including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022adverse changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022oil price volatility;\n\u2022trade protection measures, tariffs, and import or export requirements;\n\u2022subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently, or may emerge as, competitors in countries in which we have operations;\n\u2022partial or total expropriation;\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022differing labor regulations;\n\u2022differing protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including any measures implemented to address the impacts of climate change; and\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $7,921.8 in total consolidated indebtedness. In addition, we had approximately $2,502 undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility. Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions.\nOur level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy. For example, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;\n\u2022limit our ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022limit our ability to make capital expenditures;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.\nUnfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business.\nSeveral of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish kroner. Sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar represented 17% and 18% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings.\nOur technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nMany of our products and services rely on proprietary technology; therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nOur future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. We intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues, profitability or cash flows.\nAcquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business.\nDivestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. The consummation of any divestiture can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified divestitures. They may also cause diversion of management time and focus away from operating our business. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, and disputes may arise with buyers that could be difficult or costly to resolve.\nProduct liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.\nOur business exposes us to product liability risks in the design, manufacture and distribution of our products. In addition, certain of our products are used in hazardous environments. We currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses. We also maintain other insurance policies, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and cyber insurance. We believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts. However, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.\nIn some of our businesses, we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers. The loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows. Additionally, many of our customers are government entities. In many situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe face intense competition from numerous competitors in our various businesses. Our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities. We may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive.\nSome of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the economy.\nSome of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial and energy markets. Accordingly, a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. If demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets, and any write-off of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled $14,094.5 compared to $11,563.8 of stockholders\u2019 equity, and represented 59% of our total assets of $23,713.9. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline, we could incur a non-cash charge to operating income. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, the effect of which could be material.\nWe depend on our ability to develop new products, and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business.\nThe future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile. This product development may require substantial internal investment. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations.\nOur business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shutdown of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. We rely on third-party cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure to host enterprise and customer systems, and any disruptions of these services could impact our business operations and our ability to service customers. Cyber-attacks, configuration or human error and/or other external hazards could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. For example, in 2020, Vertafore determined that as a result of human error, three data files containing Texas driver\u2019s license data were inadvertently stored in an unsecured external storage service that appears to have been accessed without authorization. As a result, Vertafore was named as a defendant in a number of putative class actions regarding the incident.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and attacks to networks, systems and endpoints can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its businesses, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including, but not limited to, cloud providers and providers of network management services. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by threat actors. Moreover, as more of our employees work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our employees are increasingly targeted by phishing attacks and endpoints may be more susceptible to threat exposures.\nOur customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and services, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, continuous\nmonitoring of our networks, endpoints and systems and maintenance of backup and recovery capabilities. Despite these efforts, we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises, and such cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, damage to our IT systems, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines, diminution in the value of our investment in research and development, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the supply of, or price for, raw materials, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.\nThe availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, supply chain delays and disruptions, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. For example, we expect to continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges, including increased material costs, component shortages and transportation disruptions and delays, all of which could escalate in the future. In addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and components, as well as any increases in commodity prices, particularly copper, could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nRegulation of privacy and data security may adversely affect sales of our products and services and result in increased compliance costs.\nThere has been, and likely will continue to be, increased regulation with respect to the collection, use and handling of an individual\u2019s personal and financial information. Regulatory authorities around the world have passed or are considering legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, privacy and data security. In the United States, Virginia and Colorado passed new comprehensive privacy legislation, and joined California (which further enhanced its existing privacy laws) in directly regulating the collection, use and sharing of personal information. These statutes create civil penalties for violations, and in the case of California, creates a private right of action for data breaches, that increases the risk of data breach litigation. Absent a pre-emptive Federal privacy law, as more states pass privacy legislation, there is a strong possibility that we will be forced to comply with a patchwork of inconsistent privacy regulations. Globally, personal information collected within the European Union and United Kingdom remains subject to the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a UK and European Union-wide legal framework that governs data collection, use, and sharing of an individual\u2019s personal data and creates a range of consumer privacy rights. GDPR provides significant penalties for non-compliance (up to 4% of global revenue) and EU data protection authorities have already issued significant fines. Similarly, in November 2021, China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) which regulates the processing of personal information of individuals within China. If a company breaches PIPL it can be assessed fines of up 5% of its annual revenue. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the United States, Europe, China and elsewhere can be uncertain and currently is in flux. Cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, including data localization requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data. The operational and cost impact of these cannot be fully known at this time. In addition to the possibility of fines, application of these existing laws in a manner inconsistent with our data and privacy practices could result in an order requiring that we change our data and privacy practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Also, any new law or regulation imposing greater fees or taxes or restriction on the collection, use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the Internet, could result in a decline in the use of our products and services and adversely affect sales and our results of operations. Finally, as we increasingly become a provider of technology solutions, our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and data handling practices, and our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers. This is particularly true for customers in highly-regulated industries, such as the healthcare industry and government contractors, and could result in regulatory actions, fines, legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand, reputation and our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAny business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, incidents of directed cyber-attacks, public health crisis, extreme weather events or other natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.\nIf terrorist activity, armed conflict, directed cyber-attacks, political instability, public health crisis, such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the COVID-19, or extreme weather events or other natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations, such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline. A prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and profits. Any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services, or who purchase goods and services from us, will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. In addition, the global COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the spread of the virus, however, we are unable predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on any of our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations. If third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us. In such events, we may incur losses, or our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected.\nChanges to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions, could harm our operating results.\nWe have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team in the past and may do so in the future. Leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business.\nLegal proceedings in which we are, or may be, a party may adversely affect us.\nWe are currently, and may in the future, become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers, intellectual property matters, third party liability, including product liability claims, and employment claims. We are and may in the future become subject to litigation regarding data or privacy incidents, as more fully described above in \u201cWe rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations\u201d.\nA downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs.\nUnfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets may be impacted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase. Additionally, our credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.", "PERMNO": 77338, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "ROP"}
