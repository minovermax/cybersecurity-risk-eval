Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u00b7 We have a limited operating history, are not profitable and may never become profitable.\n\u00b7 The Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has materially and adversely affected the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform.\n\u00b7 We are substantially dependent on the success of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and cannot be certain that it will be successfully commercialized.\n\u00b7 We face unproven markets for our products.\n\u00b7 Our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.\n\u00b7 The commercial potential of our products is difficult to predict. The market for any product, or for companion animal diagnostics and medical devices overall, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7 Our proposed and future products will face significant competition and may be unable to compete effectively.\n\u00b7 Under the terms of our partnership arrangements, we are required to make significant milestone and other payments to our strategic partners. The timing of any such payments is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are not able to make such payments when due, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u00b7 We will rely on third parties to conduct certain portions of our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\n\u00b7 We will rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our product candidates or products could be delayed.\n\u00b7 If we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our existing or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts and commercialize any of our existing or future products.\n\u00b7 Various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our products or otherwise negatively impact our business.\n\u00b7 Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is limited.\n\u00b7 Our diagnostic technologies depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from marketing our diagnostic product candidates.\n\u00b7 We will be obligated to pay a significant portion of our net sales to the holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares. This payment obligation will materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources, may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital, and could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.\n\u00b7 We expect that the price of our common shares will fluctuate substantially.\n\u00b7 We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act and if we take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d our common shares could be less attractive to investors.\n\u00b7 We have incurred significant costs as a result of operating as a U.S. and Canadian public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, are not profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe have not generated any revenue to date, and we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs and other expenses. Our net loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was approximately $16.9 million and $19.8 million. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $68.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had total shareholders' equity of approximately $66.1 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our product development and commercialization activities. Even if we succeed in developing and broadly commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or cease operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to achieve our goals.\nWe do not have any products available for sale at this time. Although we believe that we do not require pre-market approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or the FDA-CVM, or the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Health Inspection Service\u2019s Center for Veterinary Biologics, or USDA-CVB, to market and sell TRUFORMA\u00ae , our Raman spectroscopy-based point-of-care diagnostic platform, nor our circulating tumor cell, or CTC, diagnostic assay that we are developing, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our expected timing for the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the five initial assays.\nWe are also seeking to identify potential complementary opportunities in the animal health sectors. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to develop our existing products and any other product that we may develop or acquire. These expenditures will include: costs of developing and validating our diagnostic products and related assays and consumables; costs associated with conducting any required clinical trials; costs associated with completing other research and development activities; costs of identifying additional potential products; costs associated with payments to technology licensors and maintaining other intellectual property; costs of obtaining regulatory approvals; costs associated with securing contract manufacturers to meet our commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities; and costs associated with marketing and selling our products. In addition, our existing and future development agreements may require us to make significant cash milestone payments to our development partners and to pay certain development costs. We will not control the timing of these payments. We also may incur unanticipated costs. Because the outcome of our development activities and commercialization efforts is inherently uncertain, the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our existing or future products may be greater or less than we anticipate.\nAs a result, we may need to obtain additional capital to fund the development of our business. Except for our unsecured working capital line we have no existing agreements or arrangements with respect to any financings, and any such financings may result in dilution to our shareholders, the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business or the value of our common shares.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our existing or future diagnostics and medical device products;\n\u00b7 the extent to which any of our future diagnostic assays or medical devices may be subject to USDA-CVB pre-market regulation;\n\u00b7 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our existing or future diagnostics or medical device products;\n\u00b7 the number and characteristics of the diagnostics and/or medical device products we pursue;\n\u00b7 the cost of contract manufacturers to manufacture our existing and future diagnostic and medical device products and any additional products we seek to commercialize;\n\u00b7 the cost of commercialization activities, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u00b7 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; and\n\u00b7 the scope and terms of our business plans from time to time, and our ability to realize upon our business plans; and\n\u00b7 the costs involved in preparing and filing patent applications, maintaining any successfully obtained patents and protecting and enforcing any such patents.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nThe \u201cNovel Coronavirus Disease 2019\u201d (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has materially and adversely affected the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic materially and adversely affected the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the initial five assays. In response to the pandemic, our development partner had reduced the number of employees working in its facilities for a period of time which has delayed the completion of the verification of the five initial TRUFORMA\u00ae assays and the manufacturing of commercial quantities of the TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the related assays. Veterinary hospitals and clinics that had agreed to participate in the validation of our initial TRUFORMA\u00ae assays either shut down for a period of time or limited their operations to those involving only life-threatening conditions, which we have mitigated to a certain extent with our recent ability to successfully complete remote installations. Potential customers have at times restricted access to their facilities which has affected and may continue to affect our ability to perform on-site demonstrations and other marketing activities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the spread and severity of COVID-19, and the effectiveness of governmental actions in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted our development partners and the COVID-19 pandemic, and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak disrupted our development partners and the COVID-19 pandemic, and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, our development partner for our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the related assays had reduced the number of employees working in its facility which significantly impacted our expected timing for the completion of the development and the commencement of the commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the related assays. If our suppliers are unable or fail to fulfill their obligations to us for any reason, we may not be able to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand or our obligations under sales agreements in a timely manner, and our business could be harmed as a result. As noted above, there is continuing uncertainty relating to the potential effect of COVID-19 on our business. Infections may become more widespread and should that cause supply disruptions it would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, a significant health epidemic could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the market for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant spike in unemployment and a concomitant decline in economic activity in the U.S. and many other countries. A worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments may have similar effects. Pet owners may be unwilling or unable to seek treatment for their pets in such circumstances, thereby decreasing demand for our products. In addition, as noted above, potential customers for our products have either shut down or limited their operations which has affected and may continue to affect our ability to perform on-site demonstrations and other marketing activities. Potential customers also may be unwilling or unable to invest in new equipment or to introduce new treatments for their patients. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products.\nWe have generated net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. income tax purposes, but our ability to use these net operating losses may be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income.\nOur U.S. businesses have generated consolidated net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cU.S. NOLs\u201d) for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes of $19,595,073 as of December 31, 2020. These U.S. NOLs can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future U.S. taxable income. The utilization of these U.S. NOLs would have a positive effect on our cash flow. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these U.S. NOLs and realize the positive cash flow benefit. A portion of our U.S. NOLs have expiration dates. There can be no assurance that, if and when we generate taxable income in the future from operations or the sale of assets or businesses, we will generate such taxable income before such portion of our U.S. NOLs expire. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d), federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), federal NOL carryforwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of such loss. Due to our cumulative losses through December 31, 2020 we do not anticipate that such provision of the CARES Act will be relevant to us. The deductibility of federal NOLs may be limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to TCJA or the CARES Act.\nWe have generated net operating loss carryforwards for Canadian income tax purposes, but our ability to use these net operating losses may be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income in Canada.\nOur Canadian businesses have generated net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cCanadian NOLs\u201d) for Canadian federal and provincial income tax purposes. These Canadian NOLs can be available to reduce Canadian income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future Canadian taxable income. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these Canadian NOLs. Our Canadian NOLs have expiration dates. There can be no assurance that, if and when we generate Canadian taxable income in the future, we will generate such taxable income before our Canadian NOLs expire.\nWe have generated U.S. NOLs, but our ability to reserve and use these U.S. NOLs may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes.\nOur ability to utilize the U.S. NOLs after an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to the rules of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) Section 382. An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, five (5%) percent or more of the value of our shares or are otherwise treated as five (5%) percent shareholders under Code Section 382 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of the value of our shares by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the value of the shares owned by these shareholders over a three-year rolling period. An ownership change could also be triggered by other activities, including the sale of our shares that are owned by our five (5%) shareholders. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 would impose an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income we may offset with U.S. NOLs. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our shares on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect on the date of the ownership change. The long-term tax-exempt rate is published monthly by the IRS. Any unused Section 382 annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective U.S. NOLs (if any). In the event an ownership change as defined under Section 382 were to occur, our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs would become substantially limited. The consequence of this limitation would be the potential loss of a significant future cash flow benefit because we would no longer be able to substantially offset future taxable income with U.S. NOLs. There can be no assurance that such ownership change will not occur in the future.\nWe have generated Canadian NOLs, but our ability to reserve and use these Canadian NOLs may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes.\nOur ability to utilize the Canadian NOLs after a \u201closs restriction event\u201d is subject to the rules of the Income Tax Act (Canada). A loss restriction event will occur if, among other things, there is change of control (which would generally occur if a person or group of related persons acquired more than 50% of our voting shares). If we experience a \u201closs restriction event\u201d: (i) we will be deemed to have a year-end for Canadian tax purposes and (ii) we will be deemed to realize any unrealized capital losses and our ability to utilize and carry forward Canadian NOLs will be restricted.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and cannot be certain that it will be successfully commercialized.\nWe are focused primarily on the development of our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays. Accordingly, our near-term prospects, including our ability to generate material product revenue, or enter into potential strategic transactions, will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of this product and the related assays, which in turn will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 the successful completion of clinical validation and verification of our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays, which may take significantly longer than we anticipate and will depend, in part, upon the satisfactory performance of our strategic partner and third-party contractors;\n\u00b7 the ability of our strategic partner to manufacture supplies of our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic instrument and the related assays and to develop, validate and maintain viable commercial manufacturing processes that are compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, to the extent applicable;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully market our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays, whether alone or in partnership with others;\n\u00b7 the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays compared to alternative and competing products;\n\u00b7 the acceptance of our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays by veterinarians, pet owners and the animal health community;\n\u00b7 our ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our business; and\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights, and avoid or prevail in any third-party patent interference, patent infringement claims or administrative patent proceedings initiated by third parties or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d).\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or commercializing our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays or any of our future products. If we are unsuccessful or are significantly delayed in developing and commercializing our products, our business and prospects will be materially adversely affected, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\nWe face unproven markets for our products.\nThe companion animal diagnostic and medical device markets are less developed than the related human markets and as a result no assurance can be given that our products will be successful. Veterinarians, pet owners or other veterinary health providers in general may not accept or utilize any products that we may develop. The companion animal care industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our products obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. We must continuously enhance our product offerings to keep pace with evolving standards of care. If we do not update our product offerings to reflect new scientific knowledge or new standards of care, our products could become obsolete, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully develop and commercialize our existing and any future products will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to convince the veterinary community of the clinical utility of our products and their potential advantages over existing tests and devices;\n\u00b7 the willingness or ability by pet owners to pay for our products and the willingness of veterinarians to recommend our products;\n\u00b7 the willingness of veterinarians to utilize our diagnostic tests and devices; and\n\u00b7 where applicable, the willingness of testing labs to buy our assay equipment.\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to complete development, supply the market, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.\nIn addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we will seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers may decline to enter into long-term contracts, and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe commercial potential of our products is difficult to predict. The market for any product, or for companion animal diagnostics and medical devices overall, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that the emerging nature of our industry and our unproven business plan make it difficult to estimate the commercial potential of any of our proposed or future products. The market for any product that we seek to commercialize will depend on important factors such as the cost, utility and ease of use of our products, changing standards of care, preferences of veterinarians, the willingness of pet owners to pay for such products, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the product development process or after commercial introduction. If the market potential for our proposed and future products is less than we anticipate due to one or more of these factors, it could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the willingness of pet owners to pay for the use of our products may be less than we anticipate and may be negatively affected by overall economic conditions. Because relatively few pet owners purchase insurance for their companion animals, pet owners are more likely to have to pay for the use of our products directly and may be unwilling or unable to pay for any such use.\nOur proposed and future products will face significant competition and may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of veterinary diagnostics and medical devices is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete effectively with other products in the market and identify potential partners for continued development and commercialization.\nThere are a number of competitors in the diagnostic market that have substantially greater financial and operational resources and established marketing, sales and service organizations. We expect to compete primarily with commercial clinical laboratories, hospitals\u2019 clinical laboratories and other veterinary diagnostic equipment manufacturers. Our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Inc., Abaxis, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoetis Inc., Heska Corporation and Zoetis Inc. We must develop our distribution channels and build our direct sales force in order to compete effectively in these markets. If we are unable to effectively manage our distribution channels in our highly competitive industry, we may fail to retain customers or obtain new customers and our business will suffer.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health diagnostics and medical devices. We also expect to compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the fields of animal diagnostics and medical devices. If such competing products are commercialized prior to our products, or if our intellectual property protection fails to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for our products, we may be unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we participate. Contractual agreements between clinics and from competitors may limit practices\u2019 ability to use other tests and technologies due to predetermined minimums in those agreements.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of our proposed and future products may be subject to extensive regulation. We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our proposed or future diagnostic or medical device products under applicable regulatory requirements or maintain any regulatory approval obtained. The denial, delay or loss of any regulatory approval would prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of our product candidates may be subject to extensive regulation. We may not be able to market and sell any point-of-care diagnostic products or medical devices without pre-marketing approval from the USDA-CVB and/or FDA-CVM. To gain approval to market a pet point-of-care diagnostic product kit or a medical device, we must provide the results of specific tests required to be conducted in accordance with USDA-CVB and/or FDA-CVM\u2019s guidance demonstrating data from Assay Validation Studies that demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity and ruggedness, and stability. In addition, we must provide manufacturing data meeting Good Manufacturing Procedures (\u201cGMP\u201d). The USDA-CVB and/or FDA-CVM may also require us to conduct costly postapproval testing and/or collect post-approval safety data to maintain our approval for any diagnostic or medical device. The results of our development activities, and the results of any previous studies conducted by us or third parties, may not be predictive of future results of future studies, and failure can occur at any time during or after the completion of development activities by us or our contract research organizations or CROs.\nThe USDA-CVB and/or FDA-CVM can delay, limit, deny or revoke approval of any of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 if they disagree with our interpretation of data from our studies or other development efforts;\n\u00b7 if they require additional studies or changes its approval policies or regulations;\n\u00b7 if they do not approve of the specifications of our proposed and future products;\n\u00b7 if they fail to approve the manufacturing processes of our third-party contract manufacturers; and\n\u00b7 if any approved product subsequently fails post-approval testing required by them.\nFurther, even if we receive approval of our products, such approval may be for a more limited claim than we originally requested, the USDA-CVB may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our products and we may be required to conduct costly post-approval testing. Any delay or failure in obtaining applicable regulatory approval for the intended claims of our product candidates would delay or prevent commercialization of such products and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nOur strategic partnerships are important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these partnerships, or if these partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into a number of strategic partnerships that are important to our business and we expect to enter into similar partnerships as part of our growth strategy. These partnerships may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 partners may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these partnerships;\n\u00b7 partners may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7 partners may not pursue development of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development based on development results, changes in the partners\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7 partners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause partners to cease to devote resources to the development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 disagreements with partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research and development of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7 partners may not properly maintain or defend their intellectual property rights or may use proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate the intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7 partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7 partners may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;\n\u00b7 there may be conflicts between different partners that could negatively affect those partnerships and potentially others; and\n\u00b7 the number and type of our partnerships could adversely affect our attractiveness to future partners or acquirers.\nIf any partnerships we enter into do not result in the successful development of our product candidates or if one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may not be able to successfully develop our product candidates, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization also apply to the activities of our partners and there can be no assurance that our partnerships will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a partner of ours is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities, the partner might deemphasize or terminate the development of any technology licensed to it by us. If one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new partners and our perception in the business and financial communities and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe may in the future determine to partner with additional life science and technology companies for development of additional products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed partnership and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to access technologies that are important for the future development of our business. If we elect to fund and undertake development activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of our partnership arrangements, we are required to make significant milestone and other payments to our strategic partners. The timing of any such payments is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we are not able to make such payments when due, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC, or Qorvo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qorvo, Inc. Under this agreement, Qorvo is responsible for the development of certain assay cartridges and the related instrument. We agreed to pay the associated non-recurring engineering costs of up to $500,000 per assay cartridge and the instrument and are responsible for the validation of the assay cartridges and the instrument. Under the terms of this agreement, we were required to pay Qorvo additional milestone payments in cash or, if elected by Qorvo, additional unregistered common shares having a value calculated as specified in the agreement. All of the milestones under this agreement have been met and we paid Qorvo a total of $10.0 million in cash in connection therewith. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for the cost of additional development work undertaken by Qorvo on our behalf.\nIn May 2018, we entered into a development, commercialization and exclusive distribution agreement with Seraph Biosciences, Inc., or Seraph. Under this agreement, we are responsible for development and validation, and their associated costs. Seraph is entitled to additional payments for development costs. Seraph will be entitled to receive up to an additional $7,000,000, payable 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in additional unregistered common shares, upon the achievement of a series of staged, specified milestones, including completion of laboratory studies and field studies, production and commercial shipment of products. In addition, we have agreed to pay Seraph license fees based on a percentage of gross profit from commercial sales of ZM-020. At December 31, 2020, all milestone payments under our agreement with Seraph remain unpaid.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct certain portions of our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have used contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct our manufacturing and research and development activities. We expect to continue to do so, including with respect to our manufacturing, clinical validation, verification and beta testing of our proposed and future diagnostic and medical device products. These CMOs and CROs are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or manage the risks associated with their activities on our behalf. We are responsible to regulatory authorities for ensuring that products subject to regulatory authority are manufactured using good manufacturing practices and studies are conducted in accordance with the development plans and trial protocols, and any failure by our CMOs and CROs to do so may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, subject us to penalties, or harm our credibility with regulators.\nOur agreements with our CMOs and CROs may allow termination by the CMOs and CROs in certain circumstances with little or no advance notice to us. These agreements generally will require our CMOs and CROs to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of the CMOs\u2019 and CROs\u2019 services under the agreements. If the CMOs and CROs conducting our manufacturing and studies do not comply with their contractual duties or obligations to us, or if they experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our development protocols or quality expectations or for any other reason, we may need to secure new arrangements with alternative CMOs and CROs, which could be difficult and costly. In such event, our studies also may need to be extended, delayed or terminated as a result, or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed, and we may be required to expend substantial additional resources.\nThe failure of any CMO and CRO to perform adequately or the termination of any arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.\nWe will rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our product candidates or products could be delayed.\nWe do not have the capability to manufacture our proposed and future products and do not intend to develop that capability. As a result, we will rely on CMOs to produce our proposed and future products. We expect to enter into contracts with CMOs for the commercial scale production of the products we intend to commercialize. Reliance on CMOs involves risks, including:\n\u00b7 the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u00b7 inability to access production facilities on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 inability or delay in increasing manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7 manufacturing and product quality issues related to the scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u00b7 costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for commercial level activity;\n\u00b7 a failure to satisfy any applicable regulatory requirements on a consistent basis;\n\u00b7 the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7 termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u00b7 the reliance on a single source of supply which, if unavailable, would delay our ability to complete the development and testing and commercialization of our products;\n\u00b7 the lack of qualified backup suppliers for supplies that are currently purchased from a single source supplier;\n\u00b7 operations of our CMOs or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the CMO or supplier;\n\u00b7 carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and\n\u00b7 the failure to deliver products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nAny of these risks could cause the delay of validation studies, clinical trials, regulatory submissions, the receipt of any required approvals or the commercialization of our products, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully. Furthermore, if our CMOs fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue.\nEven if a product receives regulatory approval, it may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nEven if we obtain USDA-CVB or other regulatory approvals for a specific product, that product may not achieve market acceptance among veterinarians and pet owners and may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the claims for which our products are approved or intended;\n\u00b7 the acceptance by veterinarians and pet owners of the product as safe and effective;\n\u00b7 the proper training and use of our products by veterinarians;\n\u00b7 the potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative diagnostics or medical devices;\n\u00b7 the cost of our products in relation to alternative diagnostics and willingness to pay for our products, if approved, on the part of veterinarians and pet owners;\n\u00b7 the willingness of pet owners to pay for the use of our products, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u00b7 the relative convenience and ease of use; and\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our products fail to achieve market acceptance or commercial success, our business could fail and you could lose your entire investment.\nIf we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell our existing or future products or generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have a fully staffed sales organization. We intend to commercialize our products with a direct sales force and through third-party distributors. To achieve this, we will be required to build a direct sales organization and to establish relationships with distributors of veterinary products. We also will have to build our marketing, sales, managerial and other non-technical capabilities and make arrangements with third parties for distribution and to perform certain of these other services, and we may not be successful in doing so. Building an internal sales organization is time consuming and expensive and will significantly increase our compensation expense. We may be unable to secure third-party distribution contracts with distributors on favorable terms or at all. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of diagnostic products or medical devices for companion animals and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. If we are unable to build an effective sales organization and/or if we are unable to secure relationships with third-party distributors for our products, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products, our future product revenue will suffer and we would incur significant additional losses.\nIn jurisdictions outside of the United States we intend to utilize companies with an established commercial presence to market our products in those jurisdictions, but we may be unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, it at all.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our existing or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts and commercialize any of our existing or future products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly Robert Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, Ann Marie Cotter, our Chief Financial Officer, Stephanie Morley, DVM, our President and Chief Medical Officer, and Bruk Herbst, our Chief Commercial Officer. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our existing or future product pipeline, completion of our planned development efforts or the commercialization of our product candidates. Although we have entered employment agreements with Mr. Cohen, Dr. Morley and Mr. Herbst for one-year terms (automatically extending for one-year terms thereafter) there can be no assurance that any of Mr. Cohen, Dr. Morley or Mr. Herbst will extend their terms of service.\nConsolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians will be our primary customers for our proposed and future products. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the consolidation of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. If this trend continues, these large clinics and hospitals could attempt to leverage their buying power to obtain favorable pricing from us and other similar companies. Any resulting downward pressure on the prices of any of our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe will need to significantly expand our organization and systems to support our future expected growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we will not be successful, and our business could fail.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds in the future through debt financing which may impose operational restrictions on our business and may result in dilution to existing or future holders of our common shares.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future to help fund our business operations. Debt financing, if available, may require restrictive covenants, which may limit our operating flexibility and may restrict or prohibit us from:\n\u00b7 paying dividends and/or making certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u00b7 incurring additional indebtedness or issuing certain preferred shares;\n\u00b7 selling some or all of our assets;\n\u00b7 entering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 creating certain liens or encumbrances;\n\u00b7 merging, consolidating, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7 designating our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nDebt financing may also involve debt instruments that are convertible into or exercisable for our common shares. The conversion of the debt to equity financing may dilute the equity position of our existing shareholders.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of diagnostic products and medical devices. We may become subject to product liability claims resulting from the use of our product candidates. We do not currently have product liability insurance and we may not be able to obtain or maintain this type of insurance for any future trials or product candidates. In addition, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. Being unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could adversely dilute your ownership of our company.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other complementary assets and businesses and may also pursue strategic alliances. We have no experience in acquiring other assets or businesses and have limited experience in forming such alliances. We may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or become subject to possible stockholder claims in connection with any related-party or third-party acquisitions or other transactions. We also could experience adverse effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles and impairment charges relating to write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets from time to time following an acquisition. Integration of an acquired company requires management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license or strategic alliance.\nTo finance future acquisitions, we may choose to issue our common shares as consideration, which would dilute your ownership interest in us. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nVarious government regulations could limit or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our products or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn the U.S., the manufacture and sale of certain diagnostic products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA or the EPA. While our point-of-care Bulk Acoustic Wave sensor-based diagnostic platform and Raman spectroscopy-based diagnostic platform and our reference lab-based diagnostic test for canine cancer do not require approval by the USDA-CVB prior to sale in the U.S., these diagnostic solutions will be subject to postmarketing oversight by the FDA-CVM. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and potentially more stringent laws in foreign countries.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products; our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws; and immigration and travel restrictions. These legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.\nAny failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB obligations and continued regulatory oversight, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, any product candidates, if approved, will be subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements and could be subject to other restrictions. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with our products could result in significant penalties.\nIf the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB approves any of our existing or future diagnostic product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration, and product listing, as well as continued compliance with GMP, Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) and Good Clinical Practices (\u201cGCP\u201d) for any studies that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u00b7 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;\n\u00b7 fines, warning letters or holds on promotional materials and claims;\n\u00b7 refusal by the FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u00b7 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA-CVM\u2019s or USDA-CVB\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms with respect to veterinary diagnostics, medical devices and test kits may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our existing or future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated and/or licensed products. In addition, FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Similar changes in laws or regulations can occur in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations in the United States may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any of our existing or future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u00b7 changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u00b7 recall, replacement or discontinuance of certain products; and\n\u00b7 additional record-keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is limited.\nOur diagnostic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these technology licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses. However, we have filed four U.S. patent applications and two Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications for U.S. and international protection of our diagnostic tests. These applications cover tests developed for our ZM-017, ZM-022 and ZM- 020 technology platforms. Even if such patents are issued, we do not expect that all of the patents will provide significant protection for our intellectual property.\nSome of our products may or may not be covered by a patent. Further if an application is filed, it is not certain that a patent will be granted or if granted whether it will be held to be valid. All of which may impact our market share and ability to prevent others (competitor third parties) from making, selling, or using our products.\nWe intend to rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our proposed and future products. We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights, and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. Any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations regardless of its outcome.\nIf we are unable to obtain trademark registrations for our products our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have pending trademark applications for our company name and composite marks comprised of our company name, logo and/or slogan in the U.S., Canada, European Union, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. In addition, we have approved pending trademark applications for our \u201cVoice of the Vet\u201d mark in the U.S. and Canada. We have secured two registrations in the European Union for our company name, company name and logo, and for the mark \u201cVoice of the Vet powered by Zomedica\u201d (and Design). We also have secured registrations in Brazil for our company name and logo. While we cannot make assurances that any pending trademark applications will mature to registration, most of these applications are now poised to mature to registration.\nWe have also filed for protection of several product names in the U.S., Canada and European Union. Currently, no significant hurdles have been encountered in the registration process. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB if it is a regulated product. The FDA-CVM typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA-CVM or the USDA-CVB object to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA-CVM and the USDA-CVB.\nThird parties may have intellectual property rights, which may require us to obtain a license or other applicable rights to make, sell or use our products. If such rights are not granted or obtained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, or license from third parties, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we believe our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to conduct our business without incurring liability to third parties, our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of such persons. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur diagnostic technologies depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from marketing our diagnostic product candidates.\nOur diagnostic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses. We do not control the prosecution, maintenance or filing of the patents and other intellectual property licensed to us, or the enforcement of these intellectual property rights against third parties. The patents and patent applications underlying our licenses were not written by us or our attorneys, and we do not have control over the drafting and prosecution of such rights. Our partners might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of patents and patent applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the intellectual property rights and had control over such drafting and prosecution. We cannot be certain that drafting and/or prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications has been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical or animal health companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, such litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Our Preferred Shares\nWe will be obligated to pay a significant portion of our net sales to the holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares. This payment obligation will materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources, may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital, and could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.\nWe are obligated to make annual payments to the holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares in an amount equal to nine percent of the net sales (as defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares), if any, of our company and our affiliates (the \u201cNet Sales Returns \u201d) until such time as the holders have received total Net Sales Returns equal to nine times the aggregate stated value of the outstanding Series 1 Preferred Shares. Such payments will materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources which could result in a shortage of capital necessary to fund our operations or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Our obligation to make these payments may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. This payment obligation also may adversely affect investor perceptions of our company which could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares.\nIn the event of a sale of our company, holders of our Series 1 Preferred Shares will be entitled to a substantial premium on the purchase price they paid for their Series 1 Preferred Shares, which will reduce the sale proceeds to be received by holders of our common shares.\nIn the event that our company is the subject of a \u201cfundamental transaction\u201d (defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares to include an amalgamation, merger or other business combination transaction involving our company in which our shareholders do not have the right to cast more than 50% of the votes that may be cast for the election of directors, or a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties and/or assets of our company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to a third party) the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares will have the right, in preference to the holders of our common shares, to receive a portion of the aggregate consideration paid in the fundamental transaction that will represent a substantial premium on the purchase price they paid for their Series 1 Preferred Shares. Such premium will reduce the proceeds of any such fundamental transaction that would be received by holders of our common shares.\nIn the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares will have a liquidation preference over holders of our common shares and if the net assets of our company available for distribution to holders of our equity securities is not sufficient to pay this liquidation preference in full, holders of our common shares would receive no liquidating distribution in respect of their common shares.\nIn the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares will have a liquidation preference equal to the stated value of the Series 1 Preferred Shares less the Net Sales Returns (as defined in the Series 1 Preferred Shares) paid on the Series 1 Preferred Shares before holders of our common shares would be entitled to any proceeds of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. If the net assets of our company available for distribution to holders of our equity securities is not sufficient to pay this liquidation preference in full, holders of our common shares would receive no liquidating distribution in respect of their common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nThe trading price of our common shares has recently increased significantly to a level that we do not believe is consistent with any recent change in our financial condition or results of operations. If the trading price of our common shares decreases rapidly, investors purchasing our common shares in this offering could lose a significant portion of their investment.\nThe trading price of our common shares has recently increased significantly. On December 31, 2020, the last reported sale price of our common shares on the NYSE American was $0.231 per share. We believe that the sharp increase in the trading price of our common shares is the result of a number of factors outside our control, including social media posts that have drawn attention to our company and increased trading in our common shares by retail investors. These social media posts were not sponsored or endorsed by us. There has been no recent change in our financial condition or results of operations that is consistent with the increase in the trading price of our common shares. The recent increase in the trading price of our common shares may not be sustained. In the event of a rapid decrease in the trading price of our common shares, investors purchasing our common shares in this offering could some a significant portion of their investment.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAlthough we have research coverage by securities and industry analysts, if coverage is not maintained, the market price for our stock may be adversely affected. Our stock price also may decline if any analyst who covers us issues an adverse or erroneous opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our product validations and operating results fail to meet analysts\u2019 expectations. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and possibly adversely affect our ability to engage in future financings.\nWe expect that the price of our common shares will fluctuate substantially.\nYou should consider an investment in our common shares risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. The price of our common shares that will prevail in the market after the sale of our common shares by a selling shareholder may be higher or lower than the price you have paid. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common shares. These risks include those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report as well as, among other things:\n\u00b7 any delays in, or suspension or failure of, our existing and future studies;\n\u00b7 announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of any of our existing or future product candidates or of regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u00b7 delays in the commercialization of our existing or future product candidates;\n\u00b7 manufacturing and supply issues related to our development programs and commercialization of our existing or future product candidates;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our product candidates;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of new product candidates, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 announcements relating to future development or license agreements including termination of such agreements;\n\u00b7 adverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or those of our principal collaborators;\n\u00b7 commencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 any major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7 new legislation in the United States and abroad relating to the prescription, sale, distribution or pricing of pet pharmaceuticals or diagnostic products;\n\u00b7 product liability claims, other litigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or future products;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the animal health industry, in general, or in the pet therapeutics sector, in particular, including performance of our competitors; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, or the market for stocks in our industry, in particular, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common shares. Any sudden decline in the market price of our common shares could trigger securities class-action lawsuits against us. If any of our shareholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our stock price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act and if we take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d our common shares could be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or SOX, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive if we choose to continue to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, however, and, as a result, we are required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOur Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize us to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval and we may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions that could dilute your ownership interest, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares\nOur Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), or ABCA to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors may determine from time to time to raise additional capital by issuing common shares, preferred shares or other equity securities. We are not restricted from issuing additional securities, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares or preferred shares. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares, or both. Holders of our common shares are not entitled to pre-emptive rights or other protections against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, the then-current holders of our common shares. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making offerings of debt or preference shares, upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, may receive distributions of our available assets before the holders of our common shares.\nWe have incurred significant costs as a result of operating as a U.S. and Canadian public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a U.S. and Canadian publicly traded company, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses and will incur additional expenses related to U.S. compliance after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities have created uncertainty for U.S. and Canadian public companies and increased our costs and time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nThe Company\u2019s attempt in December 2020 to obtain shareholder approval for a domestication to the State of Delaware was unsuccessful. As a result, the Company will have to continue to comply with legal requirements applicable to a publicly traded company in both Canada and the U.S., resulting in additional legal and financial compliance costs and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other U.S. public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d These exceptions provide for, but are not limited to, relief from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, less extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. To the extent we are no longer eligible to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, we may be unable to realize our anticipated cost savings from those exemptions.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nAs a Canadian public company, we are permitted to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of U.S. public companies required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. We were required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our management has reported on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. Additionally, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, and the Canadian requirements permit this relaxation of the strict requirements of Section 404. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nIn connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nIf we sell common shares in future financings, shareholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our share price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional common shares at a discount from the existing trading price of our common shares. As a result, our shareholders would experience immediate dilution upon the sale of any shares of our common shares at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred shares or common shares. If we issue common shares or securities convertible into common shares, our common shareholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our share price may decline.\nFuture sales of our common shares by our shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of February 26, 2021, we had 947,248,207 common shares outstanding. Substantially all of our outstanding common shares have been registered for resale or other disposition by the holders thereof or are otherwise freely tradable by the holders thereof.\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares by our shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nWe have never and do not, in the future, intend to pay dividends on our common shares, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our common shares.\nWe have never paid and do not expect to pay dividends on our common shares in the future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common shares. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common shares. There is no assurance that our common shares will appreciate in price.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common shares may not develop or be sustained, and you may not be able to sell your common shares.\nOur common shares trade on the NYSE American exchange. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell the common shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling common shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications or technologies using our common shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with such requirements, our common shares would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our common shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. Although the trading price of our common shares on the date of this report exceeded $0.20 per share, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the trading price of our common shares was well below $0.20 for a significant period of time. We received a deficiency letter from the NYSE American indicating that we were not in compliance with the listing requirements, because our common shares had been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period time. Such deficiency was resolved in January 2021.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common shares from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our common shares would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common shares are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may in future implement the reduction in the stated capital account applicable to our common shares that has been approved by shareholders, and if we do, there may be an adverse effect on holders of common shares or the Company in connection with certain transactions, unless we are able to add back some or all of the stated capital reduction to the stated capital account at that time.\nAt the Company\u2019s annual and special meeting of shareholders held on September 25, 2020, the shareholders approved a special resolution under the ABCA authorizing the reduction of the stated capital account applicable to the common shares to US $1.00 in the aggregate without payment to the shareholders. The special resolution provided that the reduction would be effective upon the date determined by any director or officer of the Company. As of the date hereof, the reduction has yet to be implemented. However, it could be implemented in the future, and if it is implemented, the reduction is expected to apply to the entire stated capital account applicable to the common shares at that time, including stated capital referenceable to common shares issued after the date of the meeting where the special resolution was approved. As disclosed in the proxy circular prepared in connection with the annual and special meeting, the stated capital reduction is not expected to result in any immediate Canadian tax consequences to shareholders, and should not constitute a taxable event to shareholders under United States tax requirements. However, the reduction in stated capital could have future Canadian federal income tax consequences to shareholders or the Company, in connection with certain transactions, including a repurchase of the common shares by the Company or certain reorganization transactions. The Company currently intends that, if the stated capital reduction is implemented, the amount of the reduction will be added back to the stated capital account (or the portion thereof that is permitted to be added back under Canadian federal income tax legislation will be so added) in the future in accordance with procedures contained in the ABCA. Such add back would be intended to be effected prior to implementation of any transaction where the previous reduction of stated capital could have an adverse impact on shareholders or the Company. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effect the add back, or that the amount added back will avoid any adverse tax consequences to shareholders or the Company.", "PERMNO": 17103, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZOM"}
