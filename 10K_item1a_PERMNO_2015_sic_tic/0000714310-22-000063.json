{"cik": "714310", "company": "VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect Valley are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Valley. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently believes are immaterial may also impair Valley\u2019s business operations. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to our Pending Merger with Bank Leumi USA\nValley is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration.\nValley has incurred and expects to incur certain non-recurring costs associated with the pending merger. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, severance/employee benefit-related costs, public company filing fees and other regulatory fees, printing costs and other related costs. Some of these costs are payable by Valley regardless of whether or not the merger is completed.\nValley is expected to incur substantial costs in connection with the integration of Valley and Bank Leumi USA. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, payroll, compliance, treasury management, vendor management, risk management, lines of business, pricing and benefits. Valley has assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred, however, there are many factors beyond Valley\u2019s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs. Moreover, many of the costs that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration costs may result in Valley taking charges against earnings following the completion of the merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. While Valley provided an assumption about the amount and timing of \"cost synergies\" when it announced the merger, those assumptions have not been updated and the amount of actual cost synergies may differ from amounts previously disclosed.\nCombining Valley and Bank Leumi USA may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and Valley may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nTo realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from the merger, Valley and Bank Leumi USA must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those synergies to be realized. If Valley and Bank Leumi USA are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual synergies and anticipated benefits of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses.\nValley and Bank Leumi USA have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Valley\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of both companies in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer relations or result in decreased revenue or reputational harm. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses, difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies\u2019 ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Any disruption to either company\u2019s business could cause its customers to remove their accounts and move their business to a competing financial institution. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Valley and Bank Leumi USA during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on Valley.\n2021 Form 10-K 20\nValley may be unable to retain Valley or Bank Leumi USA personnel successfully while the merger is pending or after the merger is completed.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on Valley\u2019s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by Valley and Bank Leumi USA. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Valley or Bank Leumi USA, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with Valley after the merger is consummated. If Valley and Bank Leumi USA are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Valley and Bank Leumi USA could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, Valley\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Valley and Bank Leumi USA to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause Valley\u2019s or Bank Leumi USA\u2019s businesses to suffer. In addition, Valley and Bank Leumi USA may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on Valley following the merger.\nVarious consents, approvals and authorizations must be obtained from certain governmental authorities, as a condition to closing of the merger. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to any or all of the following: an adverse development in either party\u2019s or its affiliates\u2019 regulatory standing, or any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment, including as a result of changes in regulatory agency leadership.\nEven if the specified regulatory approvals are granted, they may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of Valley\u2019s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger Agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of Valley following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger.\nThe market price of Valley Common Stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of Valley Common Stock currently.\nValley\u2019s business differs from that of Bank Leumi USA. Accordingly, the results of operations of Valley and the market price of Valley Common Stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Valley and Bank Leumi USA.\nThe future results of Valley following the merger may suffer if Valley does not effectively manage its expanded operations.\nFollowing the merger, the size of the business of Valley will increase beyond its current size. Valley\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. Valley may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of its business. There can be no assurances that Valley will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nBank Leumi USA is subject to regulatory risks in connection with its international private banking business, and these risks may adversely affect Valley after completion of the merger.\nBank Leumi USA operates a private banking business with domestic clients and international clients primarily domiciled in Latin America. The risk of noncompliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d) and the rules of the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) can be heightened for financial institutions that have a significant number of international customers, and can be particularly acute for financial institutions that have a significant number of customers from, or do business in, Latin America. AML laws and OFAC rules and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\n2021 Form 10-K\nFollowing the completion of the merger, Valley will be responsible for maintaining a compliance program that is effective in combating the increased legal and regulatory risks associated with Bank Leumi USA\u2019s international private banking business. Valley will evaluate on an ongoing basis whether enhancements are appropriate so that Valley continues to maintain an effective compliance program following the completion of the merger, Valley may not be able to eliminate all attempts by customers to use Valley to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. If Valley\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or fail to prevent violations of applicable laws or regulations, the OCC, along with other banking agencies, have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on Valley, and Valley\u2019s business and reputation could suffer. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBank Leumi USA and its subsidiaries are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, the results of which could have an adverse effect on Valley after completion of the merger.\nBank Leumi USA and its subsidiaries are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings and may from time to time be involved in government and regulatory investigations and inquiries, relating to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of their businesses. For example, Bank Leumi USA is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, captioned Bassem Al-Tamimi, et al v. Sheldon Adelson, et al., Docket No. 1:16-cv-00445. The plaintiffs, both Palestinian nationals and Palestinian Americans, generally allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to expel all non-Jews from a territory in the Middle East. Bank Leumi USA believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend against this action vigorously. However, the ultimate outcome of this matter, any future similar matters, and any other legal proceedings in which Bank Leumi USA is or may become involved cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse judgments, fines or penalties in one or more of the legal proceedings in which Bank Leumi USA and its subsidiaries are or may become involved could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. The full extent and duration of the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects are currently unknown and could be significant.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deterioration in business, economic, and market conditions and household incomes, including in the states of New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama where we conduct nearly all of our business. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our capital and liquidity, and on our business, results of operations, financial position and prospects generally will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:\nThe duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. COVID-19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the pandemic, future resurgences of COVID-19 (including the Delta and Omicron variants and any future variants) in our primary market areas, the efficacy of vaccines and the timing of the distribution and public acceptance of such vaccines or other treatments, continue to be impossible to predict. There remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery and the return of business and consumer confidence.\nThe response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities. While many responsive measures, such as curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 and deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses, have been eliminated or curtailed due to the availability of vaccines, we cannot predict whether such measures will be reintroduced. Furthermore, vaccine and mask mandates throughout our market areas are inconsistent and may inhibit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. These measures are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether and to what extent governmental and nongovernmental authorities will continue to implement policy measures to assist us and our customers and the failure to do so could have adverse effects on our business.\nThe effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties, including inflationary pressure, supply chain challenges, unemployment, labor market shortages and vaccine mandates, are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly and we anticipate will continue to do so. As a result, our credit, operational, and other risks have generally increased and, for the foreseeable future, are expected to remain elevated or increase further.\nThe effect on economies and markets. Whether current and/or future actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 in the future is unclear. National, regional, and local economies (including the local economies in the markets areas which we serve) recovered in 2021 but could deteriorate in\n2021 Form 10-K 22\n2022 and beyond due to the Delta and Omicron variants and any future variants. Markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. Governmental actions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can provide no assurance that governmental or non-governmental mitigation efforts will continue or be effective in the future.\nIn 2021, our provision expense for credit losses decreased significantly as compared to 2020. However, with recent increases in COVID-19 infection rates in our market areas, the level of our provision expense remains subject to meaningful uncertainty.\nGovernments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures. For example, on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy. The FRB has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well. Since March 15, 2020, these have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25 percent, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. However, given the increase in inflation in 2021, it is expected that the FRB will raise interest rates and wind down U.S. Treasury securities purchases in 2022.\nWhile there is evidence that our actions and those of governments and others have assisted our customers, counterparties, and third-party service providers and advanced our business and the economy generally it is uncertain what the effect will be once those policies are discontinued. For example, while the FRB\u2019s monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers, this policy and sudden shifts may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interest rate risk.\nIn order to safeguard the health and wellness of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, we modified our business practices. While many of these restrictions were lifted in 2021, we still have not lifted all safeguards and we may choose, or be required, to implement new restrictions in the future including vaccine and mask mandates. These measures, and further actions we may take as required by government authorities or that we otherwise determine are in the best interests of our customers and employees, could increase certain risks, including cybersecurity risks, impair our ability to perform critical functions and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are unable to estimate the near-term and ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business and operations at this time. The pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, additional increases in our allowance for credit losses, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources, further reduced demand for our products and services, and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, sustained adverse effects may impair our capital and liquidity positions, require us to take capital actions, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, result in downgrades in our credit ratings, and the reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in future periods.\nWe may be required to consult with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) before declaring cash dividends on our common stock, which ultimately may delay, reduce, or eliminate such dividends and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. We may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations, financial condition or other metrics which could be adversely impacted by the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remains unknown.\nIn July 2020, the FRB updated its supervisory guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the situations in which bank holding companies, like Valley, may expect an expedited consultation in connection with the declaration of dividends that exceed quarterly earnings. To qualify, amongst other criteria, total commercial real estate loan concentrations cannot represent 300 percent or more of total capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio cannot increase by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months. Currently, we believe that Valley does not meet the standard for expedited consultation and approval of its dividend, should it be required. As a result, Valley could be subject to a lengthier and possibly more burdensome review process by the FRB when considering paying dividends that exceed quarterly earnings. The delay, reduction or elimination of our quarterly dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See additional information regarding our quarterly cash dividend and the current rate of earnings retention in the \"Capital Adequacy\" section of the MD&A.\n2021 Form 10-K\nRisks Associated with Our Business Model\nOur investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects, community development and, prior to 2019, renewable energy resources. Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. Third parties perform diligence on these investments for us on which we rely both at inception and on an on-going basis. We are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our financial results. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside our control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed.\nWe previously invested in mobile solar generators sold and leased back by DC Solar and its affiliates (DC Solar). DC Solar had its assets frozen in December 2018 by the U.S. Department of Justice. DC Solar and related entities are in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A group of investors who purchased mobile solar generators from, and leased them back to, DC Solar, including us received tax credits for making these renewable resource investments. During the fourth quarter 2019, several of the co-conspirators pleaded guilty to fraud in the on-going federal investigation. Based upon this new information, Valley deemed that its tax positions related to the DC Solar funds did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in Valley's tax reserve assessment at December 31, 2019. As a result, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, included an increase to our provision for income taxes of $31.1 million, reflecting the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions related to tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the DC Solar funds plus interest. The principals pled guilty to fraud in early 2020. During 2021, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit connected with our investment in DC Solar.\nWhile we believe that Valley was fully reserved for the tax positions related to DC Solar at December 31, 2021, we continue to evaluate all our existing tax positions each quarter under U.S. GAAP.\nWe recently implemented new deposit services for businesses in the state licensed cannabis industry which could expose us to additional liabilities and regulatory compliance costs.\nIn 2020, we implemented specialized deposit services intended for a limited number of state licensed medical-use cannabis business customers. Medical use cannabis, as well as recreational use businesses are legal in numerous states and the District of Columbia, including our primary markets of New Jersey, New York, and Florida. However, such businesses are not legal at the federal level and cannabis remains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In 2014, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published guidelines for financial institutions servicing state legal cannabis businesses. We have implemented a comprehensive control framework that includes written policies and procedures related to the on-boarding of such businesses and the monitoring and maintenance of such business accounts that comports with the FinCEN guidance. Additionally, our policies call for due diligence review of the cannabis business before the business is on-boarded, including confirmation that the business is properly licensed and maintains the license in good standing in the applicable state. Throughout the relationship, our policies call for continued monitoring of the business, including site visits, to determine if the business continues to meet our requirements, including maintenance of required licenses and calls for undertaking periodic financial reviews of the business. The Bank\u2019s program originally was limited to offering depository products to medical cannabis businesses. Deposit transactions are monitored for compliance with the applicable state medical program rules and other regulations before approval and acceptance by the Bank\u2019s BSA/AML Department. More recently, the Bank has agreed to limited lending on real estate and expanded to licensed recreational dispensaries. The Bank may offer additional banking products and services to such customers in the future.\nWhile we believe our policies and procedures will allow us to operate in compliance with the FinCEN guidelines, there can be no assurance that compliance with the FinCEN guidelines will protect us from federal prosecution or other regulatory sanctions. Federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutors will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis. Any change in the federal government\u2019s enforcement position, could potentially subject us to criminal prosecution and other regulatory sanctions. While we also believe our BSA/AML policies and programs for this new business are sufficient, the medical and recreational cannabis business is considered high-risk, thus increasing the risk of a regulatory action against our BSA/AML program that has adverse consequences, including but not limited to, preventing us from undertaking mergers, acquisitions and other expansion activities.\n2021 Form 10-K 24\nThe loss of or decrease in lower-cost funding sources within our deposit base, including our inability to achieve deposit retention targets under our branch transformation strategy, may adversely impact our net interest income and net income.\nChecking and savings, NOW, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or money market or fixed income mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return trade-off. Additionally, our customers largely bank with us because of our local customer service and convenience. For certain customers, this convenience could be negatively impacted by recent branch consolidation activity undergone as part of our branch transformation strategy. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, Valley could lose a low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing Valley\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect our asset quality and profitability for those loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within our loan portfolio.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2021 approximately 75 percent of our total loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and could deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A downturn in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected. Any declines in home or commercial real estate prices in the New Jersey, New York and Florida markets we primarily serve, along with the unpredictable long-term impact and path of the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios. Unexpected decreases in home or commercial real estate prices coupled with slow economic growth and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses. In that event, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur future goodwill impairment.\nIf our estimates of the fair value of our goodwill change as a result of changes in our business or other factors, we may determine a goodwill impairment charge is necessary. Estimates of the fair value of goodwill are determined using several factors and assumptions, including, but not limited to, industry pricing multiples and estimated cash flows. Based upon Valley\u2019s 2021 goodwill impairment testing, the fair values of its four reporting units, wealth management, consumer lending, commercial lending, and investment management, were in excess of their carrying values. No assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2021, our goodwill totaled $1.5 billion. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOur market share and income may be adversely affected by our inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers, digital fintech start-up firms and other financial services providers which have advanced technological capabilities.\nValley faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than Valley to deal with the potential negative changes in the financial markets and regulatory landscape. Many of these competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. Valley competes with other providers of financial services such as commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, money market and mutual funds, mortgage companies, title agencies, asset managers, insurance companies, and a large list of other local, regional and national institutions which offer financial services.\nAdditionally, the financial services industry is facing a wave of digital disruption from fintech companies and other large financial services providers. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services which increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. These competitors provide innovative web-based solutions to traditional retail banking services and products. Fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts, including Valley.\nRegulatory changes may continue to allow new entrants into the markets in which we operate. The result of these regulatory changes will likely cause other non-traditional financial services companies to compete directly with Valley. Many\n2021 Form 10-K\nof the companies have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts, including Valley.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. As a result of COVID-19, customers have become more reliant on, and their expectations have increased with respect to, this technology. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Many of Valley\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Valley may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on Valley\u2019s business and, in turn, Valley\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully implement our growth strategies could cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses which may not be recouped and adversely affect our future profitability.\nFrom time to time, Valley may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Valley may invest significant time and resources to develop and market new lines of business and/or products and services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting customer preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Additionally, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of Valley\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans, as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur future losses in connection with repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market.\nWe engage in the origination of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market, while typically retaining the loan servicing. In connection with such sales, we make representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. The aggregate principal balances of residential mortgage loans serviced by the Bank for others approximated $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Over the past several years, we have experienced a nominal amount of repurchase requests, and only a few of which have actually resulted in repurchases by Valley (only five and two loan repurchases in 2021 and 2020, respectively). None of the loan repurchases resulted in a material loss. As of December 31, 2021, no reserves pertaining to loans sold were established on our financial statements. While we currently believe our repurchase risk remains low based upon our careful loan underwriting and documentation standards, it is possible that requests to repurchase loans could occur in the future and such requests may have a negative financial impact on us.\n2021 Form 10-K 26\nNet gains on sales of residential mortgage loans are a significant component of our non-interest income and could fluctuate in future periods.\nNet gains on sales of residential mortgage loans represented approximately 17 percent and 23 percent of our non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our net gains on sales of loans for each period are comprised of both gains on sales of residential mortgages and the net change in the mark to market gains and losses on our loans held for sale carried at fair value at each period end. Our ability or decision to sell a portion of our mortgage loan production in the secondary market is dependent upon, amongst other factors, the levels of market interest rates, consumer demand marketable loans, our sales and pricing strategies, the economy and our need to maintain the appropriate level of interest rate risk on our balance sheet. A change in one or more of these or other factors could significantly impact our ability to sell mortgage loans in the future and adversely impact the level of our non-interest income and financial results.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them, in particular due to an increasingly competitive labor market. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel, including, but not limited to, the executive officers disclosed in Item 1 of this Annual Report, could have a material adverse impact on our business because we would lose the employees\u2019 skills, knowledge of the market, and years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nClimate change and severe weather could significantly impact our ability to conduct our business.\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, seal level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives.\nA significant portion of our primary markets is located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather, or in response to climate change, that could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Many areas in New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama in which our branches operate are subject to severe flooding from time to time and significant disruptions related to the weather may become common events in the future. Heavy storms and hurricanes can also cause severe property damage and result in business closures, negatively impacting both the financial health of retail and commercial customers and our ability to operate our business. The risk of significant disruption and potential losses from future storm activity exists in all of our primary markets.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the OCC, along with other banking agencies, have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on us. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings.\nValley\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on\n2021 Form 10-K\ninterest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond Valley\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, competition, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the FRB. Changes in interest rates driven by such factors could influence not only the interest Valley receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) Valley\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of Valley\u2019s financial assets, including the held to maturity and available for sale investment securities portfolios, and (iii) the average duration of Valley\u2019s interest-earning assets and liabilities. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk). The FRB has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between 0.00 and 0.25 percent during 2021. Although, the FRB is expected to increase the target federal funds rate and effectively increase interest rates in 2022, we can give no assurances that market interest rates will increase, decrease or remain unchanged. Any substantial or unexpected change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See additional information in the \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d and \u201cInterest Rate Sensitivity\u201d sections of our MD&A.\nThe replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on Valley\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain loans made by us and financing extended to us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In addition, we also have investments, interest rate derivatives and borrowings that reference LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Subsequently, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration announced its plan to extend the date most U.S. dollar LIBOR values would cease being computed to June 30, 2023. On the same date, the FRB, FDIC and OCC issued a joint statement instructing banks to cease entering into new LIBOR-based loan agreements by no later than December 31, 2021. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) has recommended the use of a SOFR. On April 6, 2021, the State of New York enacted legislation which provides that any contract governed by New York law and which references LIBOR and which does not contain effective \u201cfallback provisions\u201d will be deemed to be replaced by the\u201crecommended benchmark replacement.\u201d Under the statute, the \u201crecommended benchmark replacement\u201d should be based on the SOFR. Similar legislation, which would cover all U.S. contracts, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2021.\nSOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between the Bank's costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may cause us to incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. These reforms may cause new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of multiple alternative reference rates. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us.\nHigher charge-offs and weak credit conditions could require us to further increase our allowance for credit losses through a provision charge to earnings.\nThe process for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is critical to our financial results and conditions. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. If our judgment proves to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan and held to maturity debt securities portfolios, as well as unfunded credit commitments. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, bank regulators review the classification of our loans in their examination of us and we may be required in the future to change the internal classification on certain loans, which may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. If actual net charge-offs were to exceed Valley\u2019s allowance, its earnings would be negatively impacted by additional provisions for credit losses. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by the OCC or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n2021 Form 10-K 28\nAn increase in our non-performing assets may reduce our interest income and increase our net loan charge-offs, provision for loan losses, and operating expenses.\nNon-performing assets (including non-accrual loans, other real estate owned, and other repossessed assets) totaled $245.4 million at December 31, 2021. Our non-accrual loans increased from 0.26 percent of total loans at December 31, 2016 to 0.70 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021 partially due to a significant increase in non-accrual taxi medallion loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Due to continued negative trends in estimated fair valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral, a weak operating environment for ride services and uncertain borrower performance, the remainder of our previously accruing taxi medallion loans were placed on non-accrual status during the first quarter 2020. At December 31, 2021, the non-accrual taxi medallion loans totaling $86.0 million had related reserves of $58.5 million, or 68.0 percent of such loans, within the allowance for loan losses.\nThese non-performing assets can adversely affect our net income mainly through decreased interest income and increased operating expenses incurred to maintain such assets or loss charges related to subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of foreclosed assets. Adverse changes in the value of our non-performing assets, or the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment within both New York City and Chicago due to the COVID-19 pandemic could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in non-performing loans in the future, or that our non-performing assets will not result in lower financial returns in the future.\nGeneral Commercial, Operational and Financial and Regulatory Risks\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nManagement periodically reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on our systems of controls and procedures, and if our system fails, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures, including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders, may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented, thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (including, for example, electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. We maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, (i) changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure or internal controls, (ii) changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition, (iii) changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services and (iv) changes in the vendor\u2019s strategic focus. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by changing economic conditions.\nFinancial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets. Weak economic conditions could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Volatility in the housing markets, real estate values and unemployment levels could result in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. The majority of Valley\u2019s lending is in northern and central New Jersey, the New\n2021 Form 10-K\nYork City metropolitan area, Florida and Alabama. As a result of this geographic concentration, a significant broad-based deterioration in economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of Valley\u2019s loan portfolio, results of operations and future growth potential. Adverse economic conditions in our market areas can reduce our rate of growth, affect our customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and adversely impact our financial condition and earnings. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the outbreak of pandemic disease, acts of terrorism, and other external events.\nThe emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, such as COVID-19, could lead to additional quarantines, business shutdowns, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability. Additionally, New York City and New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the United States. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have established and regularly test disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals.\nWe may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy. Any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, these acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of The Westchester Bank and pending acquisition of Bank Leumi USA, could involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management's attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers, and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates, integrating acquired institutions, or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for acquisitions can be intense, and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions, or if such transactions are completed, that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations. Ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nThe future impact of changes to the Internal Revenue Code is uncertain and may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. Congress passed significant reform of the Internal Revenue Code, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) at the end of 2017. While the decline in the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent lowered Valley\u2019s income tax expense as a percentage of its taxable income in 2018 and subsequent years, other provisions of the Tax Act negatively impacted Valley's consolidated financial statements and it may adversely affect Valley in the future. For example, under the provisions of the Tax Act, the $2.5 million, $3.3 million and $2.5 million of the Bank's total FDIC insurance assessment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was non-tax deductible based upon the asset size of the Bank. If Valley's total assets were to exceed $50 billion at any year-end which is likely at the end of 2022 due to the pending acquisition of Bank Leumi USA, its entire FDIC insurance assessment would be non-tax deductible in that fiscal year. The future impact of the Tax Act or subsequent amendments to the tax rates and laws on our business may be adverse.\nOur adoption of the CECL model for determining our allowance for credit losses has added volatility and could add additional volatility, to our provision for credit losses and earnings.\nEffective January 1, 2020, Valley adopted the FASB's new accounting guidance on the impairment of financial instruments, commonly known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The CECL model requires the allowance for credit losses for certain financial assets, including loans, held to maturity securities and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, to be calculated based on current expected credit losses over the lives of the assets rather than incurred losses as of a point in time.\nOur estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses. Accordingly, our actual allowance for credit losses may be materially different than the amounts reported due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process, including future loss\n2021 Form 10-K 30\nestimates based upon our reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Also, the future amount could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date.\nWe may be unable to adequately manage our liquidity risk, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities, or pay regular dividends on our common stock.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that Valley will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources, such as the FHLB and certain brokered deposit channels established by the Bank.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could have a detrimental impact to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness, or downturn, in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.\nCyber attacks could compromise our information or result in the data of our customers being improperly divulged or our systems being disrupted which could expose us to liability, losses and escalating operating costs.\nValley regularly collects, processes, transmits and stores confidential information regarding its customers, employees and others for whom it services loans. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on Valley\u2019s behalf. Information security risks have increased because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. Many financial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, denial-of-service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and other means. In addition, recently there have been well-publicized \u201cransomware\u201d attacks against various U.S. companies with the intent to materially disrupt their computer network and services. Valley frequently experiences attempted cybersecurity attacks against its systems. In 2021, there was a breach by a threat actor of a legacy network from an acquired bank. The breach resulted in the unauthorized access of certain data stored on the legacy network. The legacy network was isolated from Valley\u2019s network, which was not affected by the incident. There can be no assurances that Valley will not incur breaches of our systems or that of our vendors which may expose the data of our customers or disrupt our services, exposing us to significant damage, on-going operational costs and/or reputational harm.\nCyber risk exposure will remain elevated or increase in the future due to, among other things, the increasing size and prominence of Valley in the financial services industry, our expansion of internet and mobile banking tools and new products based on customer needs, and the system and customer account conversions associated with the integration of merger targets. Successful attacks on any one of many our third-party service providers may adversely affect our business and result in the disclosure or misuse of our confidential information or that of our customers. There can be no assurance that we or our third-party service providers will not suffer a cyber attack that exposes us to significant damages, operational costs, or reputational harm.\nExtensive regulation and supervision have a negative impact on our ability to compete in a cost-effective manner and may subject us to material compliance costs and penalties.\nValley, primarily through its principal subsidiary and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Many laws and regulations affect Valley\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. They encourage Valley to ensure a satisfactory level of lending in defined areas and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti-money laundering and customer identification. Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect Valley in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject Valley to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or\n2021 Form 10-K\nincrease the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Valley\u2019s compliance with certain of these laws will be considered by banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions.\nIn addition, we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny from the current presidential and congressional administrations as compared to prior administrations. Changes in key personnel at our federal regulators may result in differing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties than was previously the case.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties also may challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards could cause us to change the manner in which we report our financial results and condition in adverse ways and could subject us to additional costs and expenses.\nValley\u2019s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of Valley\u2019s assets or liabilities and financial results. Valley identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of Valley\u2019s external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Such changes are expected to continue and may accelerate dependent upon the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board commitments to achieving convergence between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Changes in U.S. GAAP and changes in current interpretations are beyond Valley\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how Valley reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, Valley could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently (also retroactively) which may result in Valley restating prior period financial statements for material amounts. Additionally, significant changes to U.S. GAAP may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations.\nClaims and litigation could result in significant expenses, losses and damage to our reputation.\nFrom time to time as part of Valley\u2019s normal course of business, customers, bankruptcy trustees, former customers, contractual counterparties, third parties and current and former employees make claims and take legal action against Valley based on actions or inactions of Valley. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to Valley, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of Valley and its products and services. This may also impact customer demand for Valley\u2019s products and services. Any financial liability could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Any reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on Valley\u2019s business.\n2021 Form 10-K 32\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Securities\nWe may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend on our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations, financial condition or other metrics. This reduction or elimination of our dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make distributions to us, we may be unable to make dividend payments to our preferred and common shareholders or interest payments on our long-term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and non-banking subsidiaries and depend on dividends, distributions, and other payments from the Bank and its non-banking subsidiaries to fund cash dividend payments on our preferred and common stock and to fund most payments on our other obligations. Regulations relating to capital requirements affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us. Additionally, if our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our preferred and common shareholders or interest payments on our long-term borrowings and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Furthermore, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nValley\u2019s shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of Valley after the acquisition of Bank Leumi USA.\nValley\u2019s shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Valley board and on other matters affecting Valley. Upon completion of the merger, Valley anticipates that shares of Valley common stock held by former Bank Leumi USA shareholders will represent approximately 16.8 percent of the outstanding shares of Valley common stock expected to be issued and outstanding as of immediately following and giving effect to the completion of the merger, with Bank Leumi Le-Israel B.M. and its subsidiaries beneficially owning approximately 14.2 percent of the outstanding shares of Valley common stock expected to be issued and outstanding as of immediately following and giving effect to the completion of the merger, and the shares of Valley common stock held by existing Valley shareholders will represent approximately 83.2 percent of the outstanding shares of Valley common stock expected to be issued and outstanding as of immediately following and giving effect to the completion of the merger, in each case based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Accordingly, Valley\u2019s shareholders may have less influence on the management and policies of Valley after completion of the merger than they now have on the management and policies of Valley.\nThe Bank Leumi USA acquisition, and future acquisitions, may dilute shareholder value, especially tangible book value per share.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other financial institutions. If the Bank Leumi USA acquisition is completed, we will issue approximately 84.9 million shares of Valley common stock. While there are many variables, we anticipate that tangible book value will be diluted by 1 percent with an earn back period expected to be approximately one year or longer depending on the speed of achieving cost savings and the amount of savings. Future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt, or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisitions.\nFuture offerings of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.\nIn the future, we may increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s actual or projected capital ratios fall below or near the current (Basel III) regulatory required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock, and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the\n2021 Form 10-K\nholders of our common stock. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more details on our common and preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 80072, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "VLY"}
