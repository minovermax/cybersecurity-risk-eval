{"cik": "1288403", "company": "W&T OFFSHORE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results of operations. We have provided below a list of known material risk factors that should be reviewed when considering buying or selling our securities. These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry, Our Business and Our Financial Condition\nFurther declines in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices or an extended period of currently depressed prices will adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments and to implement our business strategy.\nThe price we receive for our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production directly affects our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities and are subject to wide price fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. The continuing depressed prices for our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production have substantially decreased our revenues on a per unit basis and have also reduced the amount of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the volume of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in global supply and demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil, NGLs, natural gas and liquefied natural gas;\n\u00b7\nacts of war, terrorism or political instability in oil producing countries;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions and events, including embargoes, affecting oil-producing activities;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global crude oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7\ngeographic differences in pricing.\nThe prices of crude oil, domestic natural gas and NGLs have declined substantially since June 2014. The price of West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil has decreased from over $100.00 per barrel in the middle of June 2014 to below $30.00 per barrel in January and February 2016. This decrease in prices has impacted companies throughout the oil and gas industry. Natural gas and NGLs prices have been negatively affected by excess natural gas production, high levels of stored natural gas and weather conditions affecting demand. In recent months, Henry Hub spot prices for natural gas declined below $1.80 per Mcf in December 2015 compared to more than $4.40 per Mcf in January 2014. Recent development activities in shale and other resource plays have the potential to yield a significant amount of natural gas and NGLs production, as well as natural gas and NGLs produced in connection with domestic oil drilling activities. The potential increases in natural gas supplies resulting from the large-scale development of these unconventional resource reserves could continue to have an adverse impact on the price of natural gas and NGLs. An environment of further or continued lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices would materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, ability to repay any borrowing base\ndeficiencies under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), to secure supplemental bonding, to secure collateral for such bonding, if required, and to meet our other financial obligations.\nThe borrowing base under our Credit Agreement may be reduced by our lenders and we are required to repay borrowings that exceed the borrowing base within 90 days in three equal monthly payments.\nAs of the time of the filing of this report, we have substantially borrowed the entire availability on our revolving bank credit facility under the Credit Agreement. Availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement is determined by establishment of a borrowing base, which is periodically redetermined during the year based on our lenders\u2019 view of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and on our proved reserves. The borrowing base under the Credit Agreement was reduced during 2015, and was $350 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to $750 million as of December 31, 2014. The lower borrowing base was primarily due to declines in commodity prices. On February 26, 2015, we announced that we had borrowed $340 million, which was substantially all of our available borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Our current borrowing base is in the process of being redetermined by our lenders and we expect there will be a reduction in our borrowing base. The borrowing base could be further reduced in the future as a result of the continued impact of low commodity prices, our lenders\u2019 outlook for future prices or our inability to replace reserves as a result of constrained capital spending. To the extent borrowings and letters of credit outstanding exceed the redetermined borrowing base, such excess or deficiency is required to be repaid within 90 days in three equal monthly payments. In addition to the borrowing base limitation, the Credit Agreement limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness if we cannot comply with specified financial covenants and ratios.\nWe may not have the financial resources in the future to repay an excess or deficiency resulting from a borrowing base redetermination as required under our Credit Agreement, which could result in an event of default. Additionally, a material reduction of our current cash position could substantially limit our ability to comply with other cash needs, such as collateral needs for existing or additional supplemental surety bonds issued to BOEM for our decommissioning obligations. Further, the failure to repay an excess or deficiency that may result from a borrowing base redetermination under our Credit Agreement may result in a cross-default under our $300 million second lien term loan (the \u201c9.00% Term Loan\u201d) and our senior notes (the \u201c8.50% Senior Notes\u201d). Sustained or lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future would continue to adversely affect our cash flow, which could result in further reductions in our borrowing base, adversely affect prospects for alternate credit availability or affect our ability to satisfy our covenants and ratios under our Credit Agreement.\nWe may be unable to provide the financial assurances demanded by the BOEM to cover our lease decommissioning obligations in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM. If extensions and modifications to the BOEM\u2019s current or future demands are needed and cannot be obtained, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases.\nThe BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations or post surety bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such decommissioning obligations will be satisfied. Prior to 2015, we were partially exempt from providing such financial assurances under our corporate structure. The significant and sustained decline in crude oil and natural gas prices, however, has resulted in the Company no longer meeting the relevant financial strength and reliability criteria for such exemptions set forth in the current regulations and procedures of the BOEM. As a result, we were notified by the BOEM in 2015 that the Company was no longer eligible for any exemption from providing financial assurances to the BOEM. Since receiving such notification, we have had discussions with the BOEM as to the amount and the properties in which the BOEM is seeking financial assurances, and with surety bond issuers as to the amount, terms, availability, cost and collateral requirements of obtaining additional surety bonds.\nIn February and March 2016, we received several demands from the BOEM ordering the Company to secure financial assurances in the form of additional surety bonds in the aggregate of $260.8 million, with amounts specified with respect to certain designated leases and rights of way. The bonds are to be secured on or before March 29, 2016. As of the date of filing this Form 10-K, we have not obtained these additional supplemental bonds, or acceptable replacement collateral or other financial assurances. We may seek to utilize different forms of financial assurances, but cannot provide assurance these different forms of collateral will be acceptable to the BOEM.\nWe could in the future receive further demands from the BOEM for additional surety bonds covering our obligations under other leases or the BOEM could increase the amount of financial assurance required for certain leases. In addition, the BOEM has issued proposed guidance describing revised supplemental bonding procedures related to obligations for decommissioning activities on the federal OCS. Were the BOEM to finalize this proposed guidance and issue revised regulations and procedures on supplemental bonding, this could result in additional demands for surety bonds or other financial assurances.\nIf we fail to comply with the current or future orders of the BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, ordering suspension of operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to post cash collateral pursuant to our agreements with sureties under our existing bonding arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to execute our capital expenditure plan, our ARO plan and comply with our existing debt instruments.\nPursuant to the terms of our agreements with various sureties under our existing bonding arrangements or under any additional bonding arrangements we may enter into, we may be required to post collateral at any time, on demand, at the surety\u2019s discretion. We have received demands for additional collateral from several of our existing sureties. The additional collateral we may be required to provide to support surety bond obligations would probably be in the form of cash or letters of credit. Given current commodity prices\u2019 effect on our creditworthiness and the willingness of the surety to post bonds without the requisite collateral, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for current bonds or for additional bonds to comply with supplemental bonding requirements of the BOEM.\nIf we are required to provide collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit, our liquidity position will be negatively impacted and may require us to seek alternative financing. To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing; we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures in future years. In addition, a reduction in our liquidity may impair our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness. Moreover, if we default on our Credit Agreement, then we would need a waiver or amendment from our bank lenders to prevent the acceleration of the outstanding debt under our Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that the bank lenders will waive or amend the Credit Agreement. Realization of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects, and we may have difficulty paying our debts as they become due.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.2 billion in principal amount of debt and in February 2016, we borrowed $340 million on our revolving bank credit facility, which was substantially the amount available. Our debt obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures and ARO, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nlimit our opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt obligations or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt obligations;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay our expenses and fund our working capital needs and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as commodity prices, other economic conditions and governmental regulation. We have fully drawn on our revolving bank credit facility for liquidity, and the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement is subject to redetermination. Substantially all of our oil, NGLs and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under our Credit Agreement and under our 9.00% Term Loan. Sustained or lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future will continue to adversely affect our cash flow and could result in further reductions in our borrowing base, reduce prospects for alternate credit availability, and affect our ability to satisfy the covenants and ratios under our Credit Agreement. Further asset sales may also reduce available collateral and availability under our Credit Agreement. In addition, we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nIf we are unable to service our indebtedness and other obligations, we may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to restructure or refinance our debt, reduce capital expenditures, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or such alternative strategies may yield insufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness is uncertain and will be affected by our future performance and events or circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under such indebtedness, the potential acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could lead to a restructuring.\nWe may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets to meet our obligations.\nSustained or lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices will adversely affect our cash flow and may lead to further reductions in the borrowing base, which could also lead to reduced prospects for alternate credit availability. The capital markets we have historically accessed as an alternative source of equity and debt capital are currently constrained to such an extent that they are virtually inaccessible. Other capital sources may arise with significantly different terms and conditions. These limitations in the capital markets may affect our ability to grow and limit our ability to replace our reserves of oil and gas.\nOur plans for growth require regular access to the capital and credit markets. If the debt or equity capital markets do not improve, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plans, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nIf crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices stay at their current levels or decrease further, we will likely be required to further write down the carrying values and/or the estimates of total reserves of our oil and natural gas properties.\nAccounting rules applicable to us require that we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties quarterly for possible impairment. Impairment of proved properties under our full cost oil and gas accounting method is largely driven by the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves estimated using SEC mandated 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month commodity prices. In addition to commodity prices, impairment assessments of proved properties include the evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors. As crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices declined in 2015, we incurred impairment charges in each quarter in 2015 totaling $987 million for the year. Such write-downs constitute a non-cash charge to earnings. Prices in January and February of 2016 were substantially below average prices in 2015. As a result, we anticipate further material impairment charges will likely occur in 2016. You should not assume that the $966 million present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved oil and gas reserves, PV-10, or our $617 million PV-10 after ARO, from our proved oil and natural gas reserves shown elsewhere in this Form 10-K represents a current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO are not financial measures defined under GAAP. For additional information about our proved reserves and a reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Properties - Proved Reserves under Part I, Item 2 in this Form 10-K.\nIn accordance with SEC requirements, we determine the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the related PV-10 and the standardized measure using the 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and estimated costs in effect on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. For example, the average price before adjustments used in the standardized measure of discounted cash flows for December 31, 2015 for WTI crude oil was $46.79 per barrel and the price of WTI crude oil during January and February 2016 has dropped below $30.00 per barrel on various days during these two months. No assurance can be given that we will not experience additional ceiling test impairments in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods taken. As a result of lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and a corresponding reduction in our capital expenditure budget for 2016, we may also reduce our estimates of the reserve volumes that may be economically recovered, which would reduce the total value of our proved reserves. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and Critical Accounting Policies - Impairment of oil and natural gas properties under Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the ceiling test, including a sensitivity analysis of our December 31, 2015 ceiling test write down based on updated pricing.\nWe may be limited in our ability to maintain proved undeveloped reserves under current SEC guidance.\nCurrent SEC guidance requires proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. If current low price conditions persist, we also may be compelled to further postpone the drilling of proved undeveloped reserves until prices recover. If we postpone drilling of proved undeveloped reserves beyond this five-year development horizon, we may have to write off reserves previously recognized as proved undeveloped. In addition, if we are unable to demonstrate funding sources for our development plan with reasonable certainty, we may have to write-off all or a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves.\nOur proved undeveloped reserves require additional future expenditures and/or activities to convert these into producing reserves. As circumstances change, we cannot provide assurance that all future expenditures will be made and that activities will be entirely successful in converting these reserves. Additionally, we are not the operator for approximately 12% of our proved undeveloped reserves, so we may not be in a position to control the timing of all development activities. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all of our undeveloped will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nRelatively short production periods for our Gulf of Mexico properties subject us to high reserve replacement needs and require significant capital expenditures to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies whose reserves have longer production periods. Our failure to replace those reserves would result in decreasing reserves, production and cash flows over time.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities at sufficient levels or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves during the initial few years of production. The majority of our current production is from the Gulf of Mexico. Reserves in the Gulf of Mexico generally decline more rapidly than from reserves in many other producing regions of the United States. Our independent petroleum consultant estimates that 55% of our total proved reserves will be depleted within three years. As a result, our need to replace reserves and production from new investments is relatively greater than that of producers who recover lower percentages of their reserves over a similar time period, such as those producers who have a larger portion of their reserves in areas other than the Gulf of Mexico. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves in sufficient quantities to sustain our current production levels or to grow production beyond current levels. In addition, due to the significant time requirements involved with exploration and development activities, particularly for wells in the deepwater or wells not located near existing infrastructure, actual oil and natural gas production from new wells may not occur, if at all, for a considerable period of time following the commencement of any particular project.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves. If we are not able to replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production at current levels.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and acquisitions with cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, securities offerings and bank borrowings. The capital markets we have historically accessed are currently constrained and we believe our access to capital markets remains limited at this time. We have substantially reduced our capital budget for 2016 in order to conserve capital and due to the lower returns from drilling in light of currently depressed oil and gas prices. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. Any reductions in our capital expenditures to stay within internally generated cash flow (which could be adversely affected by declining commodity prices) and cash on hand will make replacing produced reserves more difficult. These limitations in the capital markets and our recently constrained capital budget adversely affect our ability to sustain our production at current levels, which are expected to be slightly lower in 2016, but then lower in future years due to natural production declines. We cannot be certain that financing for future capital expenditures will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. For additional financing risks, see \u201c- Risks Related to Financings.\u201d\nAdditional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill-response plans, and other related restrictions arising after the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, the federal government, acting through the U.S. Department of the Interior and its implementing agencies that have since evolved into the present day BOEM and BSEE, have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. These governmental agencies have implemented and enforced new rules, Notices to Lessees and Operators and temporary drilling moratoria that impose safety and operational performance measures on exploration, development and production operators in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise resulted in a temporary cessation of drilling activities. Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory restrictions in addition to any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development and oil spill-response plans could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, developing and implementing new, more restrictive requirements.\nAmong other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding requirements and incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. Since the adoption of these new regulatory requirements, the BOEM has been taking longer to review and approve permits for new wells than was common prior to the Deepwater Horizon incident. These new requirements also increase the cost of preparing permit applications and increase the cost of each new well, particularly for wells drilled in the deepwater on the OCS. Additional federal action is likely. For example, in April 2015, BSEE released a proposed rule containing more stringent standards relating to well control equipment used in connection with offshore well drilling operations. The proposed standards focus on blowout preventers, along with well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring, and subsea containment requirements. If similar material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations.\nFurther, the deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lack the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite our oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to future events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident. The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe could be exposed to uninsured losses in the future. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event not covered in whole or in part by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance. In May and June 2015, we renewed our insurance policies covering well control, hurricane damage, general liability and pollution. These policies reduce, but do not totally mitigate, our risk as we are exposed to amounts for retention and co-insurance, limits on coverage and some events that are not insured. These policies expire in May and June 2016. We also have other smaller per-occurrence retention amounts for various other events. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable, as gradual seepage and pollution are not covered under our policies. Because third-party drilling contractors are used to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of workmen\u2019s compensation laws in dealing with their employees.\nOPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill. We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $150 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS. As a result of the BP Deepwater Horizon incident, legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility to $300 million or more. If OPA is amended to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility to $300 million, we may experience difficulty in providing financial assurances sufficient to comply with this requirement. We cannot predict at this time whether OPA will be amended, or whether the level of financial responsibility required for companies operating on the OCS will be increased. In any event, if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we may be liable for costs and damages, which costs and liabilities could be material to our results of operations and financial position.\nFor some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Hurricane Remediation, Insurance Claims and Insurance Coverage under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information on insurance coverage.\nInsurance for well control and hurricane damage may become significantly more expensive for less coverage, and some losses currently covered by insurance may not be covered in the future.\nIn the past, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have caused catastrophic losses and property damage. Well control insurance coverage has become more limited at times and the cost of such coverage has become both more costly and more volatile at times. The insurance market may change dramatically in the future due to the major oil spills, such as BP\u2019s Macondo well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico occurring in 2010. As of December 31, 2015, virtually all of our PV-10 value of proved reserves is on platforms that are covered under our current insurance policies for named windstorm damage, but these policies only cover a portion of the risk.\nIn the future, our insurers may not continue to offer us the type and level of our current coverage, or our costs may increase substantially as a result of increased premiums and there could be an increased risk of uninsured losses that may have been previously insured. We are also exposed to the possibility that in the future we will be unable to buy insurance at any price or that if we do have claims, the insurance companies will not pay our claims. The occurrence of any or all of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity derivative positions may limit our potential gains.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risk in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we periodically enter into oil and natural gas price commodity derivative positions with respect to a portion of our expected production. While these commodity derivative positions are intended to reduce the effects of volatile crude oil and natural gas prices, they may also limit future income if crude oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by such positions. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u00b7\nour production is less than expected;\n\u00b7\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge arrangements; or\n\u00b7\nthe counterparties to the derivative contracts fail to perform under the terms of the contracts.\nSee Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 6 - Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on derivative transactions.\nCompetition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense; some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that may give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors have financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical expertise and personnel than we have. We actively compete with other companies in our industry when acquiring new leases or oil and natural gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. Our competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay or finance. On the acquisition opportunities made available to us, we compete with other companies in our industry for such properties through a private bidding process, direct negotiations or some combination thereof. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties that generate acceptable rates of return under forecast future prices and costs. Our competitors may have significantly more capital resources and less expensive sources of capital for these prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted. The availability of properties for acquisition depends largely on the divesting practices of other oil and natural gas companies, commodity prices, general economic conditions and other factors we cannot control or influence. Additional requirements and limitations recently imposed on us and our ability to finance such acquisitions may put us at a competitive disadvantage for acquiring properties. These risks are described above in the risk factor entitled: We may be unable to provide the financial assurances demanded by the BOEM to cover our lease decommissioning obligations in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM. If extensions and modifications to the BOEM\u2019s current or future demands are needed and cannot be obtained, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases.\nWe conduct exploration, development and production operations on the deep shelf and in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, which presents unique operating risks.\nThe deep shelf and the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico are areas that have had less drilling activity due, in part, to their geological complexity, depth and higher cost to drill and ultimately develop. There are additional risks associated with deep shelf and deepwater drilling that could result in substantial cost overruns and/or result in uneconomic projects or wells. Deeper targets are more difficult to interpret with traditional seismic processing. Moreover, drilling costs and the risk of mechanical failure are significantly higher because of the additional depth and adverse conditions, such as high temperature and pressure. For example, the drilling of deepwater wells requires specific types of rigs with significantly higher day rates, as compared to the rigs used in shallower water. Deepwater wells have greater mechanical risks because the wellhead equipment is installed on the sea floor. Deepwater development costs can be significantly higher than development costs for wells drilled on the conventional shelf because deepwater drilling requires\nlarger installation equipment, sophisticated sea floor production handling equipment, expensive state-of-the-art platforms and infrastructure investments. Deep shelf development can also be more expensive than conventional shelf projects because deep shelf development requires more drilling days and higher drilling and service costs due to extreme pressure and temperatures associated with greater depths. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our oil and natural gas exploration activities in the deep shelf, the deepwater and elsewhere will be commercially successful.\nOur estimates of future asset retirement obligations may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations are concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe are required to record a liability for the present value of our ARO to plug and abandon inactive non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or such requirements may be interpreted more restrictively, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated ARO in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimate of future ARO could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of platform damage.\nDuring 2015, the additional bonding requirements under the BOEM\u2019s existing NTL #2008-N07 have increased the costs of our operations and availability of such bonds has been decreasing rapidly due to the decreases in commodity prices. In addition, the demand received from the BOEM in February 2016 will increase our costs and impact our liquidity in the future. The BOEM\u2019s proposed guidance or any issuance of a revised NTL that will replace the existing NTL #2008-N07 on supplemental bonding is likely to further increase such costs and decrease such bond availability. In addition, increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment could result in increased costs for plugging and abandonment operations. These items have, and may, further increase our costs and may impact our liquidity adversely.\nWe may be obligated to pay costs related to other companies that have filed for bankruptcy or have indicated they are unable to pay their share of costs in joint ownership arrangements.\nIn our contractual arrangements of joint ownership of oil and gas interests with other companies, we are obligated to pay our share of operating, capital and decommission costs, and have the right to a share of revenues after royalties and certain other cash inflows. If one of the companies in the arrangement is unable to pay its agreed upon share of costs, generally the other companies in the arrangement are obligated to pay the non-paying company\u2019s obligations. Under joint operating agreements among working interest owners, the non-paying company would typically lose the right to future revenues, which would be distributed to the other companies in the arrangement. If future revenues are insufficient to defray these additional costs, especially in case where the well has stopped producing and is being decommissioned, we would be obligated to pay certain costs. In addition, the liability to the U.S. Government for obligations of lessees under federal oil and gas leases, including obligations for decommissioning costs, is generally joint and several among the various co-owners of the lease, which means that any single owner may be liable to the U.S. Government for the full amount of all lessees\u2019 obligations under the lease. In certain circumstances, we also could be liable for decommissioning liabilities on federal oil and gas leases that we previously owned and the assignee is bankrupt or unable to pay its decommissioning costs. For example, we have received a demand for payment of such costs related to property interests that were sold several years ago. These indirect obligations would affect our costs, operating profits and cash flows negatively and could be substantial.\nWe may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our non-operated properties.\nAs we carry out our drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. We have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties and their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\napproval of other participants in drilling wells and such participants\u2019 financial resources;\n\u00b7\nselection of technology; and\n\u00b7\nthe rate of production of the reserves.\nOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including adverse weather conditions, cost overruns, equipment shortages, geological issues and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of a natural gas or oil well does not assure us that we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells hinder our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities, involve a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nexplosions;\n\u00b7\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, such as tropical storms, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain insurance at reasonable rates;\n\u00b7\nfailure to receive payment on insurance claims in a timely manner, or for the full amount claimed;\n\u00b7\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u00b7\ncasing collapses or failures;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u00b7\nabnormally pressured formations or rock compaction; and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures, encountering NORM, and discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations;\n\u00b7\nrepairs required to resume operations; and\n\u00b7\nloss of reserves.\nOffshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks related to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from tropical storms, hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. Companies that incur environmental liabilities frequently also confront third-party claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment from a polluted site. Despite the \u201cpetroleum exclusion\u201d of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. We may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners, operators, other third parties, or at properties we have sold. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development and acquisitions or result in the loss of property and equipment.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties along the U.S. Gulf Coast and adjacent waters on and beyond the OCS means that some or all of our properties could be affected by the same event should the Gulf of Mexico experience:\n\u00b7\nsevere weather, including tropical storms and hurricanes;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory environment.\nBecause a majority of our properties could experience the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other operators who have properties over a wider geographic area. For example, net production of approximately 8.7 Bcfe was deferred as a result of damage caused primarily by Hurricane Ike in 2009 and Hurricane Isaac caused net production deferral of approximately 2.9 Bcfe in 2012. In 2015 and 2014, we experienced production deferrals of similar levels due to other events, such as pipeline shut-ins.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to immediately identify liabilities associated with these properties or obtain protection from sellers against them.\nOur business strategy includes growing by making acquisitions, which may include acquisitions of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped leasehold interests. Our acquisition of oil and natural gas properties requires assessments of many factors that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u00b7\nacceptable prices for available properties;\n\u00b7\namounts of recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs;\n\u00b7\nestimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u00b7\nestimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.\nOur assessment of the acquired properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we have historically not physically inspected every well, platform or pipeline. Even if we had physically inspected each of these, our inspections may not have revealed structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion, well bore issues or groundwater contamination. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities associated with such risks. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nWe may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses.\nIncreasing our reserve base through acquisitions is an important part of our business strategy. We may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses. In particular, we may face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel and operations in an effective manner. The failure to successfully integrate such properties or businesses into our business may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any acquisition we make may involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\na significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets;\n\u00b7\nthe incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets, including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets before our acquisition;\n\u00b7\nour lack of drilling history in the geographic areas in which the acquired business operates;\n\u00b7\ncustomer or key employee loss from the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nincreased administration of new personnel;\n\u00b7\nadditional costs due to increased scope and complexity of our operations; and\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our ongoing business.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that we acquire properties substantially different from the properties in our primary operating region or acquire properties that require different technical expertise, we may not be able to realize the economic benefits of these acquisitions as efficiently as with acquisitions within our primary operating region. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisition we may make.\nEstimates of our proved reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in the estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities of and present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of our reserves at December 31, 2015. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Oil and natural gas reserve quantities, under Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves information reported in Business under Part I, Item 1, Properties under Part I, Item 2 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our year-end reserve estimates, our independent petroleum consultant projected our production rates and timing of development expenditures. Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be under our control. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, which prices are not reflective of the lower prices realized in December 2015, January 2016 and February 2016. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rate of return.\nA prospect is an area in which we own an interest, could acquire an interest or have operating rights, and have what our geoscientists believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of economic accumulations of oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial seismic data processing and interpretation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure that the analysis we perform using data from other wells, more fully explored prospects and/or producing fields will accurately predict the characteristics and potential reserves associated with our drilling prospects. The recent downturn in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas pricing will also significantly impact the projected rates of return of our projects without the assurance of significant reductions in costs of drilling and development. To the extent we drill additional wells in the deepwater and/or on the deep shelf, our drilling activities could become more expensive. In addition, the geological complexity of deepwater, deep shelf and various onshore formations may make it more difficult for us to sustain our historical rates of drilling success. As a result, we can offer no assurance that we will find commercial quantities of oil and natural gas and, therefore, we can offer no assurance that we will achieve positive rates of return on our investments.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which in most cases are owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells because of a reduction in demand for our production or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipelines or gathering system capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver our production to market. We have, in the past, been required to shut in wells when hurricanes have caused or threatened damage to pipelines and gathering stations. For example, in September 2008, as a result of Hurricane Ike, two of our operated platforms and eight non-operated platforms were toppled and a number of platforms, third-party pipelines and processing facilities upon which we depend to deliver our production to the marketplace were damaged. In 2012, under threat of Hurricane Isaac, we shut in most of our offshore production for a period of 10 to 25 days. Similar shut-ins of lower magnitude occurred in 2013.\nIn some cases, our wells are tied back to platforms owned by parties who do not have an economic interest in our wells and we cannot be assured that such parties will continue to process our oil and natural gas.\nCurrently, a portion of our oil and natural gas is processed for sale on platforms owned by parties with no economic interest in our wells and no other processing facilities would be available to process such oil and natural gas without significant investment by us. In addition, third-party platforms could be damaged or destroyed by hurricanes which could reduce or eliminate our ability to market our production. As of December 31, 2015, 13 fields, accounting for approximately 12.8 Bcfe (or 13%) of our 2015 production, are tied back to separate, third-party owned platforms. There can be no assurance that the owners of such platforms will continue to process our oil and natural gas production. If any of these platform operators ceases to operate their processing equipment, we may be required to shut in the associated wells, construct additional facilities or assume additional liability to re-establish production.\nIf third-party pipelines connected to our facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport our crude oil and natural gas or if the prices charged by these third-party pipelines increase, our revenues or costs could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines that provide delivery options from our facilities. Because we do not own or operate these pipelines, their continued operation is not within our control. If any of these third-party pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport crude oil and natural gas, or if the gas quality specification for the natural gas pipelines changes so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas on those pipelines, our revenues could be adversely affected. For example, in 2013, various pipelines were shut down causing production deferral of approximately 6.3 Bcfe. Our Mississippi Canyon 506 field (Wrigley) was the field most significantly affected by the shutdowns, as it was shut down for all of 2013 and more than half of 2014.\nCertain third-party pipelines have submitted or have made plans to submit requests to increase the fees they charge us to use these pipelines. These increased fees could adversely impact our revenues or operating costs, either of which would adversely impact our operating profits, cash flows and reserves.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas and operational safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, such as:\n\u00b7\nland use restrictions;\n\u00b7\nlease permit restrictions;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, such as plugging and abandonment bonds;\n\u00b7\nspacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7\nsafety precautions;\n\u00b7\noperational reporting;\n\u00b7\nreporting of natural gas sales for resale; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries;\n\u00b7\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u00b7\nwell site reclamation costs; and\n\u00b7\ngovernmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. It is also possible that a portion of our oil and natural gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed explanation of regulations impacting our business.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws, endangered species laws and regulations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u00b7\nrequire the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u00b7\nlimit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas or that may affect certain wildlife, including marine mammals; and\n\u00b7\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u00b7\nthe assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\nloss of our leases;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations; and\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of injunctive relief.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the\nrelease or contamination and regardless of whether our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages. Examples of recent proposed and final regulations include the following:\n\u00b7\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Certain areas of the country currently in compliance with the ground-level ozone NAAQS standard may be reclassified as non-attainment and such reclassification may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.\n\u00b7\nReduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry. In August 2015, the EPA proposed rules that will establish emission standards for methane from certain new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, and transmission facilities as part of the Obama Administration\u2019s goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 emission levels by 2025. The EPA\u2019s proposed rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants and pneumatic pumps. The EPA is expected to finalize these rules in 2016.\n\u00b7\nEndangered Species. We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. Presence of these species in areas where we operate could cause increased costs arising from species protection measures, or could result in limitations or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities.\nThese and other regulatory changes could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays to or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our environmental and endangered species regulations.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC and CFTC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EP Act of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional operations to FERC annual reporting and posting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the CFTC, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation rules relating to the prices or futures of commodities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by Congress, the FERC, or the CFTC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability. See Business - Regulation under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for further description of our regulations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA has adopted two sets of rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one of which imposes preconstruction and operating permit requirements of certain large stationary sources. The EPA also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified\nlarge greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the greenhouse gases monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. The Obama Administration announced in January 2015 its goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 emission levels by 2025, and in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The EPA\u2019s proposed rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. Compliance with these proposed rules will require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and the increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nThe United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, many of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such climate effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See - Our business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses. - under this Item 1A.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation and regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the negative effect of commodity price changes, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nIn July 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDF Act\u201d), was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The DF Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the DF Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Colombia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us in connection with covered derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although the Company expects to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margins. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to the Company for its needs. The DF Act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe full impact of the DF Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company\u2019s business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The DF Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties or reduce liquidity. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the DF Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nFinally, the DF Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the DF Act is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe own a platform in a highly regulated National Marine Sanctuary, which increases our compliance costs and subjects us to risk of significant fines and penalties if we do not maintain rigorous compliance.\nWe own a platform located in a National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico that is subject to special federal laws and regulations. This production platform is not producing and will be plugged, abandoned and remediated according to regulations. Unique regulations related to operations in the Sanctuary include, among other things, prohibition of drilling activities within certain protected areas, restrictions on substances that may be discharged, depths of discharge in connection with drilling and production activities and limitations on mooring of vessels. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations or the imposition of injunctive relief, including cessation of production from wells associated with this platform.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by security breaches, including cyber-security breaches, which could affect our production of oil and natural gas or could affect other parts of our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record aspects of our business. Although we take measures to protect against cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to our confidential and proprietary information, our security measures may not be able to detect or prevent every attempted breach. Similar to other companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, although we have not suffered any material losses related to such attacks. Security breaches include, among other things, illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. A breach could result in an interruption in our operations, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, violation of privacy or other laws and exposure to litigation. Any of these security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of members of our senior management could adversely affect us.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management. The loss of the services of any of our senior management, including Tracy W. Krohn, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie L. Vazquez, our President; John D. Gibbons, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Thomas P. Murphy, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operations Officer; Stephen L. Schroeder, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer; and Thomas F. Getten, our Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, could have a negative impact on our operations. We do not maintain or plan to obtain for the benefit of the Company any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. See Executive Officers of the Registrant under Part I following Item 3 in this Form 10-K for more information regarding our senior management team.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for United States production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Moreover, President Obama has proposed, as part of the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2017, to impose an \u201coil fee\u201d of $10.25 on a per barrel equivalent of crude oil. This fee would be collected on domestically produced and imported petroleum products. The fee would be phased in evenly over five years, beginning October 1, 2016 if enacted as proposed.\nIt is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and production, and any such change could have a negative effect on the results of our operations.\nCounterparty credit risk may negatively impact the conversion of our accounts receivables to cash.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from crude oil, NGLs and natural gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic or other conditions. In recent years, market conditions resulting in downgrades to credit ratings of energy merchants affected the liquidity of several of our purchasers.\nRisks Related to Our Principal Shareholder, Tracy W. Krohn\nWe will be controlled by Tracy W. Krohn as long as he owns a majority of our outstanding common stock, and other shareholders will be unable to affect the outcome of shareholder voting during that time. This control may adversely affect the value of our common stock and inhibit a change of control.\nTracy W. Krohn owns and controls 40,049,164 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 52.3% of our voting interests as of February 15, 2016. As a result, Mr. Krohn has the ability to control the outcome of matters that require a simple majority of shareholders for approval. Mr. Krohn, subject to any duty owed to our minority shareholders under Texas law, is able to control all matters affecting us, including:\n\u00b7\nthe composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n\u00b7\nthe determination of incentive compensation, which may affect our ability to retain key employees;\n\u00b7\nany determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n\u00b7\nour acquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u00b7\nour financing decisions and our capital raising activities;\n\u00b7\nour payment of dividends on our common stock, subject to the restrictions in our Credit Agreement and indentures; and\n\u00b7\namendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws.\nMr. Krohn is generally not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party. In addition, his concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that might be beneficial to our business or shareholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nDue to Mr. Krohn\u2019s ownership and control, we are exempted from many New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) corporate governance rules, and, as a result, our other shareholders may not have the protections set forth in those rules, particularly in the event of conflicts of interest with Mr. Krohn.\nMr. Krohn owns a majority of our common stock, and, therefore, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. As such, we are not required to comply with certain corporate governance rules of the NYSE that would otherwise apply to us as a listed company on that exchange. These rules are generally intended to increase the likelihood that boards will make decisions in the best interests of shareholders. Should the interests of Mr. Krohn differ from those of other shareholders, the other shareholders will not be afforded the protections of having all of the other directors on the board being independent from our principal shareholder.", "PERMNO": 90533, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WTI"}
