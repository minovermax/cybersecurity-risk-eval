RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a business environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the\n- 12 -\nfuture could affect, our operations. You should carefully consider these risks. These risks are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the events or circumstances described in the followings risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or any combination of the foregoing, could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur risks are described in detail below; however, the more significant risks we face include the following:\n\u00b7\nif we are unable to attract new customers, or if our existing customers do not purchase additional products or services, the growth of our business and cash flows will be adversely affected;\n\u00b7\nour failure to sustain our historical renewal rates, pricing and terms of our customer contracts would adversely affect our operating results;\n\u00b7\nto the extent that future sales opportunities trend towards individual product sales rather than multi-product sales, the average sales price per customer of our solutions would likely decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase future revenue and profitability;\n\u00b7\nwe are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and result in slower growth;\n\u00b7\nwe expect to continue to develop and acquire new product and service offerings with no guarantee that we will be able to market, develop or integrate any new products effectively or efficiently;\n\u00b7\nif we do not successfully maintain the SciQuest brand, our revenues and earnings could be materially adversely affected.;\n\u00b7\neconomic factors can cause reductions in spending by our customers and potential customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, lengthen our sales cycles and make it difficult for us to forecast operating results accurately;\n\u00b7\nif we are unable to adapt our products and services to rapid technological change, our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected;\n\u00b7\na failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 information could expose us to litigation, materially damage our reputation and harm our business, and the costs of preventing such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nif we are not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government and industry-specific requirements, we could incur liability and our reputation and operating results could be harmed;\n\u00b7\nour future profitability and cash flows are dependent upon our ability to control expenses; and\n\u00b7\nour future revenue growth could be impaired if our investment in direct and indirect sales channels for our products is unsuccessful.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, or if our existing customers do not purchase additional products or services, the growth of our business and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenues and cash flows, we must regularly add new customers and sell additional products and services to our existing customers. If we are unable to hire or retain quality sales personnel, unable to generate sufficient sales leads through our marketing programs, unable to sell our products and services to potential or current customers or if our existing or new customers do not perceive our solutions to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we may not be able to increase sales and our operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, our revenue growth is partially dependent on the continued sale of our products across the entire addressable market for spend management solutions without regard to our historical vertical markets. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to sell our products services outside of our historical vertical markets, our revenue growth, cash flows and profitability may be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to sell new products and services to existing or new customers, our operating results will suffer, and our revenue growth, cash flows and profitability may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to sustain our historical renewal rates, pricing and terms of our customer contracts would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our license revenues from recurring subscription fees for our spend management solutions. Should our current customers lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of our solutions, the demand for our products and services will likely decline, which could materially and adversely affect our renewal rates, pricing and contract\n- 13 -\nterms. Our subscription agreements with customers are typically for either a term of ranging from three to five years in length or a one-year term with automatic renewal provisions. Our value proposition and high customer satisfaction rates have led to strong recurring revenue retention rates of approximately 100%, 96% and 98% for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We calculate recurring revenue retention rates for a particular period by dividing one by the subscription revenue for all customers at the end of the prior period multiplied by the subscription revenue for those same customers at the end of the current period. If our customers choose not to renew their subscription agreements with us at similar rates and on similar or more favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nTo the extent that future sales opportunities trend towards individual product sales rather than multi-product sales, the average sales price per customer of our solutions would likely decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase future revenue and profitability.\nOur solutions consist of individual products that can be deployed together as an integrated software suite or separately as individual solutions. We price our solutions in part based on the number of products purchased. Accordingly, multi-product sales of an integrated software suite will likely result in significantly higher subscription and service fees than sales of individual products even though the sales cycle will often be similar in terms of length and effort. Most of our customers do not currently utilize all, or even a majority, of our solutions, and we anticipate that many of the cross-selling opportunities into our installed customer base will be individual product sales as opposed to multi-product sales. To the extent that future sales opportunities trend towards individual product sales rather than multi-product sales, then the average sales price per customer of our solutions will likely decrease. Decreases in our average sales price per customer will require us to convert a greater number of sales opportunities, at potentially greater expense, in order to meet our revenue objectives. Thus, an increase in the number of individual product sales as compared to multi-product sales could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase future revenue and profitability.\nWe are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and result in slower growth.\nOur sales cycle may take several months to over a year. We may also experience unexpected delays that may lengthen the sales cycle for particular customers or potential customers. Such delays also make it more difficult to predict sales cycles and the timing of future revenues. During this sales cycle, we may expend substantial resources with no assurance that a sale will ultimately result. The length of a customer\u2019s sales cycle depends on a number of factors, many of which we may not be able to control, including the following:\n\u00b7\npotential customers\u2019 internal approval processes;\n\u00b7\nbudgetary constraints for technology spending;\n\u00b7\ncustomers\u2019 concerns about implementing new procurement methods and strategies; and\n\u00b7\nseasonal and other timing effects.\nAny lengthening of the sales cycle or unexpected delays with respect to particular customers or potential customers could delay our revenue recognition and cash generation and could cause us to expend more resources than anticipated. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales or if we experience delays, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe expect to continue to develop and acquire new product and service offerings with no guarantee that we will be able to market, develop or integrate any new products effectively or efficiently.\nExpanding our product and service offerings is an important component of our business strategy. Any new offerings that are not favorably received by prospective customers could damage our reputation or brand name. Expansion of our offerings will require us to devote a significant amount of time and money and may strain our management, financial and operating resources. We cannot be assured that our development or acquisition efforts will result in commercially viable products or services. In addition, we may bear development and acquisition costs in current periods that do not generate revenues until future periods, if at all. To the extent that we incur expenses that do not result in increased current or future revenues, our earnings may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully maintain the SciQuest brand, our revenues and earnings could be materially adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining and enhancing the SciQuest brand in a cost-effective manner is critical in expanding our customer base, particularly in the general commercial market. Some of our competitors have well-established brands. Although we believe that the SciQuest brand is well established in certain markets where we have a significant operating history, our brand may not be as well established throughout our entire addressable market. Promotion of our brand will depend largely on continuing our sales and marketing efforts and providing high-quality products and services to our customers. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments. We cannot be assured that these efforts will be successful in marketing the SciQuest brand.\n- 14 -\nFurthermore, our marketing efforts may be complicated by the third party actions, including the marketing efforts of our competitors, which may include incomplete, inaccurate and false statements about our company and our services. Our ability to respond to any misleading marketing efforts or other false statements may be limited under certain circumstances. If we are unable to successfully promote our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in attempting to do so, our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nEconomic factors can cause reductions in spending by our customers and potential customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, lengthen our sales cycles and make it difficult for us to forecast operating results accurately.\nOur revenues depend significantly on economic conditions in our addressable market as well as the economy as a whole. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, spending constraints by our customers and potential customers due to economic factors affecting particular customers, industries or the U.S. or global economy as a whole. Many of our customers and potential customers face significant budgetary constraints that have limited spending on technology solutions. Continued spending constraints may result in slower growth, or reductions, in revenues and profits in the future. In addition, economic factors or uncertainty may cause customers and potential customers to reduce or delay technology purchases, including purchases of our solutions. Our sales cycle may lengthen if purchasing decisions are delayed as a result of uncertain budget availability or if contract negotiations become more protracted or difficult as customers institute additional internal approvals for information technology purchases. Economic factors could also cause customers to attempt to cancel or not renew existing contracts. These economic factors could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or delayed payments, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events or any significant reduction in spending by our customers and potential customers would likely harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to adapt our products and services to rapid technological change, our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nRapid changes in technology, products and services, customer requirements and operating standards occur frequently. These changes could render our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. Any technological changes that reduce or eliminate the need for spend management solutions could harm our business. We must continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services, particularly in response to our competition.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nenhance our existing products and services;\n\u00b7\ndevelop new products, services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers and potential customers; and\n\u00b7\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nWe cannot be certain of our success in accomplishing the foregoing. If we are unable, for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt to changing market conditions or buyer requirements, our market share, business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nA failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 information could expose us to litigation, materially damage our reputation and harm our business, and the costs of preventing such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection and use of confidential information of our customers and their trading partners. We cannot be assured that our efforts to protect this confidential information will be successful. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. If any compromise of this information security were to occur, we could be subject to legal claims and government action, experience an adverse effect on our reputation and need to incur significant additional costs to protect against similar information security breaches in the future, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, because of the critical nature of data security, any perceived breach of our security measures could cause existing or potential customers not to use our solutions and could harm our reputation.\nIf we are not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government and industry-specific requirements, we could incur liability and our reputation and operating results could be harmed.\n- 15 -\nThere are a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Any failure to comply with such requirements could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers or cause existing customers to not renew their agreements with us. In addition, some of the industries we serve have industry-specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards. If we cannot comply or if we incur a violation in one or more of these requirements, which could result in significant liability and harm our reputation and operating results.\nOur future profitability and cash flows are dependent upon our ability to control expenses.\nOur operating plan to maintain profitability is based upon estimates of our future expenses. For instance, we expect our operating expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 in order to support anticipated revenue growth. If our future expenses are greater than anticipated, our ability to maintain profitability may be negatively impacted. Greater than anticipated expenses may negatively impact our cash flows, which could cause us to expend our capital faster than anticipated. Also, a large percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, which may make it difficult to reduce expenses significantly in the future.\nOur future revenue growth could be impaired if our investment in direct and indirect sales channels for our products is unsuccessful.\nWe have invested significant time and resources in developing our direct sales force and our indirect sales channels. Sales through our direct sales force represent the primary source of our revenues. We supplement our direct sales force with indirect sales channels for our products through relationships with suppliers, technology providers, consultants, ERP providers and purchasing consortia. We cannot be assured that our direct or indirect sales channels will be successful or that we will be able to develop additional indirect sales channels to support our direct sales channel. If our direct sales efforts, and to a lesser extent our indirect sales efforts, are not effective, our ability to achieve revenue growth may be impaired. As we develop additional indirect sales channels, we may experience conflicts with our direct sales force to the extent that these sales channels target the same customer bases. Successful management of these potential conflicts will be necessary in order to maximize our revenue growth.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, subject to claims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. Any such claims may require us to incur significant costs, to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or to develop or license substitute technology, which may harm our business.\nThe spend management market is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we seek to extend our solutions, we could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. While we believe that our products do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, particularly with respect to technology that we acquire through acquisitions of other companies.\nWe might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation, given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We generally provide in our customer agreements that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our technology provided to the customer, which could obligate us to fund significant additional amounts. If our products are found to have violated any third-party proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those products from the market, re-develop those products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop our products, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Withdrawal of any of our products from the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience service failures or interruptions due to defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes that comprise our solutions, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nTechnology solutions as complex as ours may contain undetected defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes that are part of the solutions we provide. If these defects lead to service failures, we could experience delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct the cause of the defects. Furthermore, from time to time, we have experienced immaterial service disruptions in the ordinary course of business. We cannot be certain that defects will not be found in new or\n- 16 -\nupgraded products or that service disruptions will not occur in the future, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause customers use our spend management solutions for critical business processes, any defect in our solutions, any disruption to our solutions or any error in execution could cause customers to not renew their contracts with us, prevent potential customers from purchasing our solutions and harm our reputation. Although most of our contracts with our customers limit our liability to our customers for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our customers\u2019 businesses, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration or to pay significant settlements or damages. We do not currently maintain any warranty reserves. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention and could cause our business to suffer.\nThe insurers under our liability insurance policy could deny coverage of a future claim for actual or alleged losses to our customers\u2019 businesses that results from an error or defect in our technology or a resulting disruption in our solutions, or our liability insurance might not be adequate to cover all of the damages and other costs of such a claim. Moreover, we cannot be assured that our current liability insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds our insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our liability insurance policy, including an increase in premiums or imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Even if we succeed in litigation with respect to a claim, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention will be diverted from our operations.\nProduct development delays could damage our reputation and sales efforts.\nDeveloping new products and updated versions of our existing products for release at regular intervals is important to our business efforts. At times, we may experience delays in our development process that result in new releases being delayed or lacking expected features or functionality. In addition, we have undertaken, and may in the future undertake, significant development efforts with respect to acquired products in order for these products to better integrate with our full product suite, which may cause interruptions or delays in our ability to sell these acquired products. New product or version releases that are delayed or do not meet expectations may result in customer dissatisfaction, which in turn could damage significantly our reputation and sales efforts. Such damage to our reputation and sales efforts could negatively impact our operating results.\nThe market for cloud-based spend management solutions is at a relatively early stage of development. If the market for our solutions develop more slowly than we expect, our revenues may decline or fail to grow and we may incur operating losses.\nWe derive, and expect in the near-term to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenues from our spend management solutions. Our current expectations with respect to growth may not prove to be correct. The market for our solutions is at a relatively early stage of development, making our business and future prospects difficult to evaluate. Should our prospective customers fail to recognize, or our current customers lose confidence in, the value or effectiveness of our solutions, the demand for our products and services will likely decline. Any significant price compression as a result of newly introduced solutions or consolidation among our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. A number of factors could affect our customers\u2019 assessment of the value or effectiveness of our solutions, including the following:\n\u00b7\ntheir comfort with current purchasing and spend management procedures;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and resources required to adopt new business procedures;\n\u00b7\nreductions in capital expenditures or technology spending budgets;\n\u00b7\nthe price, performance and availability of competing solutions or delivery platforms; or\n\u00b7\nsecurity and privacy concerns.\nThe failure to successfully integrate businesses that we have acquired or may acquire could adversely affect our business.\nAn element of our strategy is to broaden the scope and content of our products and services through the acquisition of existing products, technologies, services and businesses. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe integration of new operations, products, services and personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of resources from our existing businesses, sites and technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to generate revenues from new products and services sufficient to offset associated acquisition costs;\n\u00b7\nthe maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n- 17 -\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business requiring greater resources than anticipated;\n\u00b7\naccounting effects that may adversely affect our financial results;\n\u00b7\nthe impairment of employee and customer relations as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u00b7\ndilution to existing stockholders from the issuance of equity securities; and\n\u00b7\nliabilities or other problems associated with an acquired business.\nWe may also have difficulty in effectively assimilating and integrating future acquired businesses, or any future joint ventures, acquisitions or alliances, into our operations, and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.\nOur growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we will not be able to implement our business plan successfully.\nWe have experienced a period of significant growth in our operations and personnel, which places a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our business strategy includes preparing for significant future growth and expanding our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure to facilitate this growth. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to prepare for and manage this growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees, including managers, as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business would be materially harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. There is no assurance that we will do so effectively. The additional headcount and operating systems that we may add will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.\nIf we are unable to facilitate the use of our implementation services by our customers in an optimal manner, the effectiveness of our customers\u2019 use of our solutions would be negatively impacted, resulting in harm to our reputation, business and financial performance.\nThe use of our solutions typically includes implementation services to facilitate the optimal use of our solutions. Successful implementation projects can be critical to maintaining our high customer satisfaction rates and can also lower support costs. These activities require substantial involvement and cooperation from both our customers and their suppliers. For example, we typically work closely with customer personnel to improve the customer\u2019s business processes, enable the customer\u2019s suppliers on the SciQuest Supplier Network and support organizational activities to assist our customer\u2019s transition to our spend management solutions. In addition, our implementation services often include extensive end-user training in order to facilitate product adoption and maximize the benefits for the organization. If we do not receive sufficient support from either the customer or its suppliers, then the optimal use of our services by the customer may be adversely impacted, resulting in lower customer satisfaction and negatively affecting our renewal rates, business, reputation and financial performance.\nIf we are not able to successfully create internal efficiencies for our customers and their suppliers, our operating costs and relationships with our customers and their suppliers will be adversely affected.\nA key component of our products and services is the efficiencies created for our customers and their suppliers. In order to create these efficiencies, it is typically necessary for our solutions to work together with our customer\u2019s internal systems such as inventory, customer service, technical service, ERP systems and financial systems. If these systems do not create the anticipated efficiencies, relationships with our customers will be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo date, we have funded our business through our cash flows from operations, and the proceeds of our initial public offering in September 2010 and our follow-on public offerings in April 2011 and March 2014. In February 2014, we filed a shelf registration\n- 18 -\nstatement on Form S-3 covering 8,000,000 shares of common stock, which may be offered and sold in one or more public offerings in the future. We sold 3,450,000 shares of common stock in our March 2014 follow-on public offering pursuant to such shelf registration statement. There can be no assurance as to whether all or any portion of the remaining shares covered by this registration statement will be offered or sold in the future. However, we may need to raise additional funds to achieve our future strategic objectives, including the execution of our strategy to pursue acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. Decreases in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions. If we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of shares of our common stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u00b7\ndevelop and enhance our solutions;\n\u00b7\npursue acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to expand our technology development, sales and/or marketing organizations;\n\u00b7\nhire, train and retain employees; or\n\u00b7\nrespond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe market for spend management solutions is highly competitive, which makes achieving market share and profitability more difficult.\nThe market for spend management solutions is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We experience competition from multiple sources, which makes it difficult for us to develop a comprehensive business strategy that addresses all of these competitive factors. We face competition primarily from relatively small specialty software vendors, large ERP vendors and internally developed and maintained solutions. Competition is likely to intensify as this market matures.\nAs competitive conditions intensify, competitors may:\n\u00b7\ndevote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns;\n\u00b7\nreduce prices of their competing products and services;\n\u00b7\ndevote substantially more resources to product development;\n\u00b7\nsecure exclusive arrangements with indirect sales channels that impede our sales;\n\u00b7\ndevelop more extensive client bases and broader client relationships than we have; and\n\u00b7\nenter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and well-financed companies.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than us. New technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressures. As a result of increased competition, we may experience reduced operating margins, as well as loss of market share and brand recognition. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and results of operations.\nWe continue to have revenue concentration in the higher education market, which could make us vulnerable to adverse trends or events affecting those markets.\nDue to our historical focus on vertical markets, we continue to have a significant portion of our revenue concentrated in the higher education market. Many of our customers and potential customers in the higher education market have been facing significant budgetary constraints that have limited spending on technology solutions. Continued spending constraints in this market may result in slower growth, or reductions, in our revenues and profits in the future. In addition, the number of potential customers in this market is relatively finite, which could limit our future growth prospects. Furthermore, many of our sales opportunities are generated by referrals from existing customers due to the collaborative nature of these markets, and therefore, our failure to provide a beneficial solution to our existing customers could adversely impact our reputation in these markets and our ability to generate new referral customers. If any of these circumstances result in decreased revenues or profitability from our existing customers in the higher\n- 19 -\neducation market or reduce our ability to generate new customers in this market, our overall revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur international sales efforts will require financial resources and management attention and could have a negative effect on our earnings.\nWe are investing resources and capital to expand our sales internationally. This will require financial resources and management attention and may subject us to new or increased levels of regulatory, economic, tax and political risks, all of which could have a negative effect on our earnings. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in creating international demand for our products and services. In addition, our international business may be subject to a variety of risks, including, among other things, increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts, applicable government regulation, conflicting and changing tax laws, economic and political conditions and potential instability in various parts of the world, fluctuations in foreign currency, increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities, difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable and the enforcement of intellectual property rights. If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating costs.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, limit our growth prospects or reduce our revenues.\nWe believe that our industry is highly fragmented and that there is likely to be consolidation, which could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition. Increased competition may cause pricing pressure and loss of market share, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, limit our growth prospects or reduce our revenues. Our competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with strategic partners or other parties. Established companies may not only develop their own products but may also merge with or acquire our current competitors. It is also possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Any of these circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nInterruptions or delays from third-party data centers could impair the delivery of our solutions, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe use third-party data centers to conduct our operations, including our primary operating centers located in Durham, North Carolina, Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and a redundant disaster recovery platform located in Scottsdale, Arizona. Generally, our solutions reside on hardware that we own and operate in these and other locations. Our operations depend on the protection of the equipment and information we store in these third-party data centers against damage or service interruptions that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, war, criminal acts, military action, terrorist attacks and other similar events beyond our control. A prolonged service disruption affecting the availability of our solutions for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability and cause us to lose recurring revenue customers or otherwise adversely affect our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data centers we use.\nOur cloud-based spend solutions are accessed by a large number of customers at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our customers and products and services available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of our third-party data centers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in our solutions or impede our ability to scale our operations. In the event that our data center arrangements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in our solutions as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services.\nWe provide service-level commitments to our customers, which could cause us to issue credits for future services if the stated service levels are not met for a given period and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur customer agreements provide service-level commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service-level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our service, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with credits for future services. Our revenue could be significantly impacted if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers. In light of our historical experience with meeting our service-level commitments, we do not currently have any liabilities on our balance sheet for these commitments. Any failure to meet our service-level commitments may require us to issue service credits. Any extended service outages could harm our reputation, revenue and operating results.\n- 20 -\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our business. We regard a substantial portion of our software products as proprietary and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secrets, customer license agreements and employee and third-party confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. These protections may not be adequate, and we cannot be assured that they will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the U.S. Other companies could independently develop similar or competing technology without violating our proprietary rights. The process of enforcing our intellectual property rights through legal proceedings would likely be burdensome and expensive, and our ultimate success cannot be assured. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize proprietary technology licensed from third parties, the loss of which could be costly.\nWe license a portion of the proprietary technology for our products and services from third parties. These third-party licenses may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the future. In addition, we must be able to integrate successfully this proprietary technology in a timely and cost-effective manner to create an effective finished product. If we fail to obtain the necessary third-party licenses on favorable terms or are unable to integrate successfully this proprietary technology on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur SciQuest Supplier Network incorporates content from suppliers that is critical to the effectiveness of our products.\nA critical component of our solutions is the SciQuest Supplier Network, which is the single integration point between our customers and all of their suppliers that provides customers with on-demand access to comprehensive and up-to-date supplier information, including supplier catalogs. These catalogs and other content are provided to us by each supplier for integration into our platform, which requires a high degree of involvement and cooperation from the suppliers. We must be able to integrate successfully this content in a timely manner in order for our customers to realize the full benefit of our solutions. Also, any errors or omissions in the content provided by the suppliers may reflect poorly on our solutions. If we are unable to successfully incorporate supplier content into our platform or if such content contains errors or omissions, then our products may not meet customer needs or expectations, and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business may suffer.\nGiven the complex nature of the technology on which our business is based and the speed with which such technology advances, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales personnel. A key factor of our success will be the continued services and performance of our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose the services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our success also depends upon our ability to identify, hire and retain other highly skilled technical, managerial, editorial, sales, marketing and customer service professionals. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot be certain of our ability to identify, hire and retain adequately qualified personnel. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investor views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material weaknesses in internal controls. We have reviewed and documented our internal controls and procedures for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. To the extent that we are not or do not remain in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and re-evaluate our financial reporting. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as increased independent auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. Further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order for us to comply with Section 404. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.\n- 21 -\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically either multi-year contracts that are generally three to five years in length or one-year contracts with annual renewal provisions. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. However, any such decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our retention rate may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nOur costs and demands upon management may continue to increase as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses as a result of being a public company. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these costs increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by changes in tax laws or regulations.\nNew sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Those enactments could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, we may become subject to new sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances as we expand our geographic reach and product offerings. In addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our product and maintenance prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing customers may elect not to renew their agreements and potential customers may elect not to purchase our services. Additionally, new, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers\u2019 and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our services. Further, these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of the technologies licensed by us incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate other open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer the portion of our solutions that incorporates the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of our solutions.\nFurther, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and although we believe we comply with the terms of those licenses, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that\n- 22 -\nimposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties, re-develop our solutions, discontinue sales of our solutions, or release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy. Laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our products or requiring modifications to our products. In addition, taxation of products and services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services and product offerings, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the conduct of our business, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration or to pay significant settlements or damages.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. For instance, we may have claims against customers for nonpayment of subscription fees or customers may pursue claims against us for our errors or omissions. In addition, disputes may arise from strategic business relationships, acquisitions or other business transactions. As our business grows, the likelihood of disputes arising may increase. Litigation or arbitration, whether as a plaintiff or a defendant, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention and could cause our business to suffer, regardless of the outcome. Failing to prevail in any legal proceeding could result in us paying significant damages or being unable to recover for damages incurred, either of which could harm our financial position.\nOur ability to use U.S. net operating loss carryforwards might be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $207.5 million for U.S. federal tax purposes, the use of which may be substantially limited. The Company believes that $8.9 million of the federal net operating loss carryforwards will be available for future utilization to the extent of future income. The Company has provided a valuation allowance for the remaining federal losses of $198.6 million due to uncertainty regarding the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize these assets. These loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. To the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. As a result, prior or future changes in ownership could put limitations on the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards. To the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur cash flows, quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur cash flows, quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate in the future. As a result, you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of future performance and period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful.\nFluctuations in our quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those listed below and others identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nmix of sales between single solution and multi-solution sales;\n- 23 -\n\u00b7\nrenewal rates of existing customers;\n\u00b7\npotential consolidation among our customers;\n\u00b7\npotential foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with expenses and sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of expenditures related to development, adaptation or acquisition of technologies, products or businesses;\n\u00b7\ncompetition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions that impact expenditures for technology solutions in our target markets.\nSuch fluctuations might lead analysts to change their models for valuing our common stock. As a result, our stock price could decline rapidly and we could face costly securities class action suits or other unanticipated issues.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we may release guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, quarterly earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance contains forward-looking statements and will be based on projections prepared by our management.\nNeither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. These projections are also based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We may state possible outcomes as high and low ranges, which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by analysts.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from our guidance, and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon, or otherwise consider, our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to implement our operating strategy successfully or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cPart I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d section of this Report could result in our actual operating results being different from our guidance, and those differences may be adverse and material.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and investors may be unable to sell their shares at or above their purchase price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the factors described in this \u201cPart I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d section or elsewhere in this Report, and other factors beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\ndecreases in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after this offering or changes in financial estimates by analysts who cover us, our competitors or our industry;\n\u00b7\nfailure by us or our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the\n- 24 -\noperating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes and international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. All of these factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders.\nCampaigns by stockholders to effect changes in publicly traded companies are sometimes led by activist investors through various corporate actions, including proxy contests. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Shareholder activism could create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, which could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. Furthermore, the election of individuals to our board of directors with a specific agenda could adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans.\nThe continued concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 5% of our common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock was held by holders of more than 5% of our common stock. These stockholders may have interests that differ from yours, and they may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with significant concentration of ownership. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, could have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u00b7\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u00b7\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u00b7\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nOur stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 6,200,000 shares of our common stock issuable under approved equity compensation plans that are covered by effective registration statements.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or discourage a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u00b7\nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\n- 25 -\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify and advance expenses to our directors, officers, employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Therefore, we will be obligated to indemnify such persons if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of an action by or in right of the company, no indemnification may generally be made in respect of any claim as to which such person is adjudged to be liable to the company. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors are not personally liable for breaches of fiduciary duties to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Therefore, our directors shall not be personally liable to the company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duties as a director, except for liability for any:\n\u00b7\nbreach of a director\u2019s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;\n\u00b7\nact or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n\u00b7\nunlawful payment of dividends or redemption of shares; or\n\u00b7\ntransaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.\nAs a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or that might exist with other companies.\nIf securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nWe believe that the trading price for our common stock will be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who may elect to cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, debt levels, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87420, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SQI"}
