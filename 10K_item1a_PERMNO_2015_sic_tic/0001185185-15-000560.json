RISK FACTORS\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.\nBusiness-Related Risks\nWe have had a history of losses and may incur future losses.\nWe were incorporated in 1990 and began our operations in 1991. We have funded our operations principally from funds raised in public and private offerings of our common stock and equity and debt securities convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock; research contracts and supply contracts; funds received under research and development grants from the Government of Israel; and sales of products that we and our subsidiaries manufacture. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit (including discontinued operations) of approximately $179.6 million. In an effort to reduce operating expenses and maximize available resources, we have consolidated certain of our subsidiaries, shifted personnel and reassigned responsibilities. We have also taken a variety of other measures to limit spending and will continue to assess our internal processes to seek additional cost-structure improvements. Although we believe that such steps have helped to reduce our operating expenses and maximize our available resources and enabled us to operate at a net profit in the recent past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitability consistently or that our business will continue to exist.\nWe need significant amounts of capital to operate and grow our business and to pay our debt.\nWe require substantial funds to operate our business, including marketing our products and developing and marketing new products. To the extent that we are unable to fully fund our operations, including repaying our outstanding debt, through profitable sales of our products and services, we will need to seek additional funding, including through the issuance of equity or debt securities. In addition, based on our internal forecasts, the assumptions described under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below, and subject to the other risk factors described herein, we believe that our present cash position and anticipated cash flows from operations and lines of credit should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements for 2015. However, in the event our internal forecasts and other assumptions regarding our liquidity prove to be incorrect, we may need to seek additional funding. There can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional financing in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities, stockholders may incur further dilution. If we incur additional indebtedness, we may be subject to affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to operate or finance our business. If additional funding is not secured, we will have to modify, reduce, defer or eliminate parts of our present and anticipated future commitments and/or programs.\nOur existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns.\nOur bank and other indebtedness (short and long term) totaled approximately $21.3 million as of December 31, 2014 (not including trade payables, other account payables, capital leases, and accrued severance pay), of which $33,000 was bank working capital lines of credit and approximately $19.3 million represents two term loans entered into to fund the UEC acquisition. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with significant indebtedness, including:\n\u2022\nwe must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay principal and interest and, as a result, we may have less funds available for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings, if available at all;\n\u2022\nwe are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nif we default under any of our existing debt instruments, including paying the outstanding principal when due, and if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price.\nFailure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in a default that could have material adverse consequences for us.\nIn February 2013, our primary bank increased our credit line (\u201cLine of Credit\u201d) by 50%, from $10.0 million to $15.0 million, and the expiration of the Line of Credit was extended to May 31, 2015. Additionally, in April 2014 we agreed with our bank to amend the Line of Credit to add two term loans to it: an $18.0 million 61-month senior term loan at an interest rate of 3.75% over LIBOR, and a $4.5 million 61-month B term loan at an interest rate of 5.5% over LIBOR along with extending the Line of Credit until May 2016.\nOur amended and restated credit agreement contains certain financial covenants. Commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, our \u201cFixed Charge Coverage Ratio\u201d, determined on a combined basis with UEC and otherwise computed in the same manner as under the previous version of the credit agreement (the \u201cOriginal Credit Agreement\u201d), has been raised to 1.25-to-1 from 1.10-to-1. \u201cNet Advances to Affiliates\u201d are now defined with reference to FAAC or UEC, as the case may be, and may not increase by more than $5.5 million on a combined basis for both borrowers in any calendar year over a \u201cBase Amount\u201d to be determined by mutual agreement of Arotech and the bank.\nIn addition, UEC\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization with certain add-backs (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), computed on a stand-alone basis, may not be less than $4.5 million for any trailing twelve-month period ending at the end of a fiscal quarter (a \u201cTest Period\u201d) beginning with the Test Period ending September 30, 2014 and each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter. Second, the ratio of \u201cCombined Funded Indebtedness\u201d (defined as all indebtedness (a) in respect of money borrowed, (b) evidenced by a note, debenture or other like written obligation to pay money, (c) in respect of rent or hire of property under leases or lease arrangements which under GAAP are required to be capitalized or (d) in respect of obligations under conditional sales or other title retention agreements, all as determined on a combined basis for FAAC and UEC) to \u201cCombined Adjusted EBITDA\u201d (defined as EBITDA of FAAC and UEC computed on a combined basis) may not exceed (a) 2.25-to-1.0 for the Test Period ending September 30, 2014 or any Test Period ending as of the end of any fiscal quarter thereafter prior to the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2015 or (b) 2.00-to-1.0 for the Test Period ending March 31, 2015 or any Test Period ending as of the end of any fiscal quarter thereafter.\nA failure to comply with the obligations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreements which could result in an acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our future cash flow or assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2014.\nWe may not be successful in operating our electronics engineering and design services for the military business, which is a new business for us.\nThe business of electronics engineering and design services for the military is a new business for us and our management group has limited experience operating this particular type of business. Although we have retained UEC\u2019s management personnel, we cannot assure that such personnel will continue to work for us or that we will be successful in managing this new business. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations and personnel of UEC into our business, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits of such acquisition. If we are unable to successfully operate this new business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially impaired.\nWe may consider acquisitions in the future to grow our business, and such activity could subject us to various risks.\nWe may consider acquiring companies that will complement our existing operations or provide us with an entry into markets we do not currently serve. Growth through acquisitions involves substantial risks, including the risk of improper valuation of the acquired business and the risk of inadequate integration. There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available, that we will be able to acquire or manage profitably such additional companies or that future acquisitions will produce returns that justify our investments in such companies. In addition, we may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have significantly greater resources than we do. Furthermore, acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract the attention of our senior officers, increase our expenses, make it difficult to maintain our operational standards, controls and procedures and subject us to contingent and latent risks that are different, in nature and magnitude, than the risks we currently face.\nWe may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations or additional debt or equity financings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate internal cash or obtain financing from external sources or that, if available, such financing will be on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of additional common stock to finance acquisitions may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. Any debt financing may significantly increase our leverage and may involve restrictive covenants which limit our operations.\nIf we are successful in acquiring additional businesses, we may experience a period of rapid growth that could place significant additional demands on, and require us to expand, our management, resources and management information systems. Our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our debt obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond our control. Consequently, we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt, we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. We cannot assure you that the terms of our debt will allow for these alternative measures or that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, in the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or restructure or refinance our debt to meet our debt obligations, we cannot assure you as to the terms of any such transaction or how quickly such transaction could be completed. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nour financial condition at the time;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in the agreements governing our other indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nother factors, including the condition of the financial markets and our industry.\nOur earnings may decline if we write off additional goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had recorded goodwill of $45.4 million. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may have a significant impact on earnings. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which, in the Power Systems Division in 2014, was a six percent margin. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a more-likely-than-not expectation that all or a significant portion of a reporting unit may be disposed of, a sustained decline in our market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, and lowered expectations of future financial results.\nSignificant judgments inherent in these analyses include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, WACC and the amount of expected future net cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the reporting units and trade name.\nThe goodwill of our Training and Simulation Division equaled $24.4 million and the goodwill of our Power Systems Division equaled $21.0 million at December 31, 2014. Based on the discounted cash flow valuation at December 31, 2014, an increase in the WACC or changes in other significant variables for the Power Systems Division could potentially result in impairment.\nSome of the components of our products pose potential safety risks which could create potential liability exposure for us.\nSome of the components of our products contain elements that are known to pose potential safety risks. In addition to these risks, there can be no assurance that accidents in our facilities will not occur. Any accident, whether occasioned by the use of all or any part of our products or technology or by our manufacturing operations, could adversely affect commercial acceptance of our products and could result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries. Any of these occurrences would materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. In the event that our products fail to perform as specified, users of these products may assert claims for substantial amounts. These claims could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that the amount of the general product liability insurance that we maintain will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present amount of insurance can be maintained at the present level of cost, or at all.\nWe are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d\nBeginning in 2014, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The definition of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d includes tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, and their derivatives, some of which we use in the activities of our Power Systems Division. These new requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nOur fields of business are highly competitive.\nThe competition to develop defense and security products and to obtain funding for the development of these products is, and is expected to remain, intense.\nOur defense and security products compete with other manufacturers of specialized training systems.\nVarious battery technologies are being considered for use in defense and safety products by other manufacturers and developers, including the following: lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel-zinc, nickel-metal hydride, sodium-sulfur, sodium-nickel chloride, zinc-bromine, lithium-ion, lithium-polymer, lithium-iron sulfide, primary lithium, rechargeable alkaline and Zinc-Air.\nMany of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. If we are unable to compete successfully in each of our operating areas, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on proprietary rights that may be difficult to protect and could affect our ability to compete effectively.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements.\nLitigation, or participation in administrative proceedings, may be necessary to protect our proprietary rights. This type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could divert company resources and management attention to defend our rights, and this could harm us even if we were to be successful in the litigation. In the absence of patent protection, and despite our reliance upon our proprietary confidential information, our competitors may be able to use innovations similar to those used by us to design and manufacture products directly competitive with our products. In addition, no assurance can be given that others will not obtain patents that we will need to license or design around. To the extent any of our products are covered by third-party patents, we could need to acquire a license under such patents to develop and market our products.\nDespite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we may not be successful in doing so. In addition, competition is intense, and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In the event of patent litigation, we cannot assure you that a court would determine that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for those inventions. If existing or future third-party patents containing broad claims were upheld by the courts or if we were found to infringe third-party patents, we may not be able to obtain the required licenses from the holders of such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain these licenses could cause delays in the introduction of our products or necessitate costly attempts to design around such patents, or could foreclose the development, manufacture or sale of our products. We could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in patent infringement suits brought by others and in prosecuting patent infringement suits against infringers.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our customers, employees, consultants, and entities with which we maintain strategic relationships. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and our business would suffer if we fail to retain them.\nWe are highly dependent on the managers of our Simulation Division and our Power Systems Division, and the loss of the services of any of these persons could adversely affect us. We are especially dependent on the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steven Esses, and our Executive Chairman, Robert S. Ehrlich. The loss of either Mr. Esses or Mr. Ehrlich could have a material adverse effect on us. We are party to employment agreements with Mr. Esses and Mr. Ehrlich, both of which agreements expire at the end of 2017. We do not have key-man life insurance on either Mr. Esses or Mr. Ehrlich.\nWe face risks related to general domestic and global economic conditions.\nIn general, our operating results can be significantly affected by negative economic conditions, high labor, material and commodity costs and unforeseen changes in demand for our products and services. These risks are heightened as economic conditions globally have deteriorated significantly and may remain at recessionary levels for the foreseeable future. The current recessionary conditions could have a potentially significant negative impact on demand for our products and services, which may have a direct negative impact on our sales and profitability, as well as our ability to generate sufficient internal cash flows or access credit at reasonable rates to meet future operating expenses, service debt and fund capital expenditures.\nThere are risks involved with the international nature of our business.\nA significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia. In 2014 and 2013, 19.1% and 16.5%, respectively, of our revenues, were derived from sales to customers located outside the U.S. We expect that our international customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future. Sales to international customers may be subject to political and economic risks, including political instability, currency controls, exchange rate fluctuations, foreign taxes, longer payment cycles and changes in import/export regulations and tariff rates. In addition, various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been and in the future may be proposed in the U.S. and certain other countries. Any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect our sales to international customers. See also \u201cIsrael-Related Risks,\u201d below.\nRisks Related to Government Contracts\nA significant portion of our business is dependent on government contracts and reduction or reallocation of defense or law enforcement spending could reduce our revenues.\nMost of our customers to date have been in the public sector of the U.S., including the federal, state and local governments and the military, and in the public sectors of a number of other countries. A significant decrease in the overall level or allocation of defense or law enforcement spending in the U.S. or other countries could reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nSales to public sector customers are subject to a multiplicity of detailed regulatory requirements and public policies as well as to changes in training and purchasing priorities. Contracts with public sector customers may be conditioned upon the continuing availability of public funds, which in turn depends upon lengthy and complex budgetary procedures, and may be subject to certain pricing constraints. Moreover, U.S. government contracts and those of many international government customers may generally be terminated for a variety of factors when it is in the best interests of the government and contractors may be suspended or debarred for misconduct at the discretion of the government. There can be no assurance that these factors or others unique to government contracts or the loss or suspension of necessary regulatory licenses will not reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nA decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in budgetary priorities or timing of contract awards may adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects.\nRevenues under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors, represent a substantial portion of our total revenues. Our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the U.S. Government or the DoD, as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts.\nAn impasse in federal budget decision-making could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. For example, as a result of inability of the U.S. Government to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration triggered substantial automatic spending reductions beginning in January 2013, divided between defense and domestic spending over a nine-year period. As a result, U.S. Government funding for certain of our customers may be reduced, delayed or eliminated, which could significantly impact these customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and if so would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. While the future impact of sequestration is uncertain, these automatic across-the-board budget cuts in sequestration could have significant negative consequences to our business and industry.\nIn years when Congress does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations are funded through a continuing resolution (CR) that temporarily funds federal agencies. Recent CRs have generally provided funding at the levels provided in the previous fiscal year and have not authorized new spending initiatives. When the federal government operates under a CR, delays can occur in the procurement of products and services. Historically, such delays have not had a material effect on our business; however, should sequestration not be alleviated, it could continue to have significant consequences to our business and our industry.\nAdditionally, our business could be affected if the demand for and priority of funding for combat operations overseas decreases, which may reduce the demand for our services on contracts supporting some operations and maintenance activities in the Department of Defense or if we experience an increase in set-asides for small businesses, which could result in our inability to compete directly for prime contracts.\nOur U.S. government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions.\nThe U.S. government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to re-compete for future contracts and orders. Our U.S. government contracts contain provisions that allow the U.S. government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations, reduce the value of existing contracts, issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, services and associated materials.\nGovernment agencies routinely audit government contracts. These agencies review a contractor's performance on its contract, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If we are audited, we will not be reimbursed for any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, while we would be required to refund any improper costs for which we had already been reimbursed. Therefore, an audit could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with United States government agencies. We could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. A governmental determination of impropriety or illegality, or an allegation of impropriety, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations, and changes in government regulations could adversely impact our revenues, operating expenses and profitability.\nOur defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses. Among the most significant regulations are the following:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations; and\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based government contracts.\nThese regulations affect how we and our customers do business and, in some instances, impose added costs on our businesses. Any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations. With respect to U.S. government contracts, any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nWe may not be able to receive or retain the necessary licenses or authorizations required for us to export or re-export our products, technical data or services, or to transfer technology from foreign sources (including our own subsidiaries) and to work collaboratively with them. Denials of such licenses and authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nU.S. regulations concerning export controls require us to screen potential customers, destinations, and technology to ensure that sensitive equipment, technology and services are not exported in violation of U.S. policy or diverted to improper uses or users.\nIn order for us to export certain products, technical data or services, we are required to obtain licenses from the U.S. government, often on a transaction-by-transaction basis. These licenses are generally required for the export of the military versions of our products and technical data and for defense services. We cannot be sure of our ability to obtain the U.S. government licenses or other approvals required to export our products, technical data and services for sales to foreign governments, foreign commercial customers or foreign destinations.\nIn addition, in order for us to obtain certain technical know-how from foreign vendors and to collaborate on improvements on such technology with foreign vendors, including at times our own foreign subsidiaries, we may need to obtain U.S. government approval for such collaboration through manufacturing license or technical assistance agreements approved by U.S. government export control agencies.\nThe U.S. government has the right, without notice, to revoke or suspend export licenses and authorizations for reasons of foreign policy, issues over which we have no control.\nFailure to receive required licenses or authorizations would hinder our ability to export our products, data and services and to use some advanced technology from foreign sources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with export control rules could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with these rules could expose us to significant criminal or civil enforcement action by the U.S. government, and a conviction could result in denial of export privileges, as well as contractual suspension or debarment under U.S. government contracts, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating margins may decline under our fixed-price contracts if we fail to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations.\nSome of our contracts are fixed-price contracts under which we bear the risk of any cost overruns. Our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions that we used in bidding for the contract. Often, we are required to fix the price for a contract before we finalize the project specifications, which increases the risk that we will misprice these contracts. The complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating our time and resources more difficult. In the event we fail to estimate our time and resources accurately, our expenses will increase and our profitability, if any, under such contracts will decrease.\nIf we are unable to retain our contracts with the U.S. government and subcontracts under U.S. government prime contracts in the competitive rebidding process, our revenues may suffer.\nUpon expiration of a U.S. government contract or subcontract under a U.S. government prime contract, if the government customer requires further services of the type provided in the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. We cannot guarantee that we, or if we are a subcontractor that the prime contractor, will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Further, all U.S. government contracts are subject to protest by competitors. The termination or nonrenewal of several of our significant contracts could result in considerable revenue shortfalls.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in, U.S. military business would have a material adverse effect on us.\nU.S. military contracts account for a significant portion of our business. The U.S. military funds these contracts in annual increments. These contracts require subsequent authorization and appropriation that may not occur or that may be greater than or less than the total amount of the contract. Changes in the U.S. military\u2019s budget, spending allocations and the timing of such spending could adversely affect our ability to receive future contracts. None of our contracts with the U.S. military has a minimum purchase commitment, and the U.S. military generally has the right to cancel its contracts unilaterally without prior notice. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, U.S. military business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nMarket-Related Risks\nThe price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may change rapidly in the future. The following factors, among others, may cause significant volatility in our stock price:\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our competitors or our customers;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the perceived ability to commercialize our technology compared to that of our competitors;\n\u2022\nrumors relating to our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of our securities, including warrants, in connection with financings and acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market or economic conditions.\nIf our shares were to be delisted, our stock price might decline further and we might be unable to raise additional capital.\nOne of the continued listing standards for our stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market (both the Nasdaq Global Market, on which our stock is currently listed, and the Nasdaq Capital Market) is the maintenance of a $1.00 bid price. Our stock price has periodically traded below $1.00 in the past. If our bid price were to decrease and remain below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq could notify us of our failure to meet the continued listing standards, after which we would have 180 calendar days to correct such failure or be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. Although we would have the opportunity to appeal any potential delisting, there can be no assurances that this appeal would be resolved favorably. As a result, there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. If our common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, we might apply to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market if we then met the initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market (other than the $1.00 minimum bid standard). If we were to move to the Nasdaq Capital Market, current Nasdaq regulations would give us the opportunity to obtain an additional 180-day grace period if we meet certain net income, stockholders\u2019 equity or market capitalization criteria; if at the end of that period we had not yet achieved compliance with the minimum bid price rule, we would be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Although we would have the opportunity to appeal any potential delisting, there can be no assurances that this appeal would be resolved favorably. In addition, we may be unable to satisfy the other continued listing requirements. As a result, there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWhile our stock would continue to trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board following any delisting from the Nasdaq, any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. Trading volume of over-the-counter bulletin board stocks has been historically lower and more volatile than stocks traded on an exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, holders of our securities could find it more difficult to sell their securities. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public equity markets.\nIn addition, if we fail to maintain Nasdaq listing for our securities, and no other exclusion from the definition of a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is available, then any broker engaging in a transaction in our securities would be required to provide any customer with a risk disclosure document, disclosure of market quotations, if any, disclosure of the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotation and compensation information must be provided prior to effecting the transaction and must be contained on the customer\u2019s confirmation. If brokers become subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules when engaging in transactions in our securities, they would become less willing to engage in transactions, thereby making it more difficult for our stockholders to dispose of their shares.\nChanges in internal controls or accounting guidance could cause volatility in our stock price.\nGuidance regarding implementation and interpretation of the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act continues to be issued by the standards-setting community. Smaller reporting companies have been granted permanent exemption from having to obtain an auditors\u2019 report on the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting. We became an accelerated filer as of December 31, 2014 and are subject to an audit of our internal controls. As a result of the ongoing interpretation of new guidance and the audit testing that may be required to be completed in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting may include an unidentified material weakness that would result in our receiving an adverse opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. This could result in significant additional expenditures responding to the Section 404 internal control audit, heightened regulatory scrutiny and potentially an adverse effect to the price of our stock.\nIn addition, due to increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding publicly traded companies, the possibility exists that a restatement of past financial results could be necessitated by an alternative interpretation of present accounting guidance and practice. Although management does not currently anticipate that this will occur, a potential result of such interpretation could be an adverse effect on our stock price.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nDuring the course of testing our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may identify and disclose material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that will have to be remedied. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal control may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain that adequacy or inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could result in our financial statements being unreliable, increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability to operate our business.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Additionally, failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could result in government investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nCompliance with public company obligations, including the securities laws and regulations, is costly and requires significant management resources, and we may fail to comply. We are now an \u201caccelerated filer,\u201d and beginning with our Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2015 will no longer qualify to report under smaller reporting company disclosure rules, and as a result will be subject to more comprehensive disclosure obligations, with increased compliance costs.\nThe federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. Because the aggregate market value of our public float was in excess of $75 million as of June 30, 2014, we became an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d as of the end of our 2014 fiscal year. As a result, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements is now required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The auditor attestation requirement applies to us for the first time with respect to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, beginning with our Form 10-Q for our first quarter of fiscal 2015, we will be required to satisfy all of the larger reporting company disclosure requirements. These requirements will increase our legal compliance obligations and costs, which could harm our results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention from business operations.\nRelatively speaking, we are a small company with limited resources. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the added \u201caccelerated filer\u201d requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in the future. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, as a result, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to declare dividends, should we decide to do so, is restricted by the terms of our debt agreements.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nonly permit removal of directors by stockholders \u201cfor cause,\u201d and require the affirmative vote of at least 85% of the outstanding common stock to so remove; and\n\u2022\nallow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders.\nThe classification system of electing directors and the removal provision may tend to discourage a third-party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors, as the classification of the board of directors increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors. These provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers, delaying changes in our control or management or may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions. The amendment of any of these provisions would require approval by holders of at least 85% of the outstanding common stock.\nIsrael-Related Risks\nA significant portion of our operations takes place in Israel, and we could be adversely affected by the economic, political and military conditions in that region.\nThe offices and facilities of Epsilor-EFL are located in Israel (in Beit Shemesh and Dimona, both of which are within Israel\u2019s pre-1967 borders). Most of our senior management is located in Beit Shemesh. Although we expect that most of our sales will continue to be made to customers outside Israel, we are nonetheless directly affected by economic, political and military conditions in that country. Accordingly, any major hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel.\nHistorically, Arab states have boycotted any direct trade with Israel and to varying degrees have imposed a secondary boycott on any company carrying on trade with or doing business in Israel. Although in October 1994, the states comprising the Gulf Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Dubai, Bahrain and Oman) announced that they would no longer adhere to the secondary boycott against Israel, and Israel has entered into certain agreements with Egypt, Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority, Israel has not entered into any peace arrangement with Syria or Lebanon. Moreover, since September 2000, there has been a significant deterioration in Israel\u2019s relationship with the Palestinian Authority. Efforts to resolve the problem have failed to result in an agreeable solution.\nIn July and August of 2006, Israel was involved in a full-scale armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party, in southern Lebanon, which involved missile strikes against civilian targets in northern Israel that resulted in economic losses. On August 14, 2006, a ceasefire was declared relating to that armed conflict, although it is uncertain whether or not the ceasefire will continue to hold.\nIsrael withdrew unilaterally from the Gaza Strip and certain areas in northern Samaria in 2005. Thereafter Hamas, an Islamist terrorist group responsible for many attacks, including missile strikes against Israeli civilian targets, won the majority of the seats in the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority in January 2006 and took control of the entire Gaza Strip, by force, in June 2007. Since then, Hamas and other Palestinian movements have launched thousands of missiles from the Gaza strip into civilian targets in southern Israel. In late 2008, a sharp increase in rocket fire from Gaza on Israel\u2019s western Negev region, extending as far as 25 miles into Israeli territory and disrupting most day-to-day civilian activity in the proximity of the border with the Gaza Strip, prompted the Israeli government to launch military operations against Hamas that lasted approximately three weeks. Israel declared a unilateral ceasefire in January 2009, which substantially diminished the frequency of, but did not eliminate, Hamas rocket attacks against Israeli cities. In November 2012, following an increase in rocket attacks and hostile activity originating from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli government launched an air attack on Hamas. Rockets were fired into Israel extending as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. After seven days, a ceasefire was agreed to by Israel and Hamas. This was followed by a period of relative calm that continued until July 2014, when rocket attacks resumed, and Israel began experiencing another round of armed conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, with missiles reaching throughout Israel and Israeli ground forces engaged in operations within the Gaza Strip. The landing of one rocket about a mile from Israel\u2019s primary international airport on July 22, 2014 caused the Federal Aviation Administration to prohibit landings of U.S.-based carriers into Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of approximately 48 hours. A ceasefire was agreed to in August 2014.\nOur Israeli production facilities in the cities of Beit Shemesh and Dimona, are located approximately 27 miles and 38 miles, respectively, from the nearest point of the border with the Gaza Strip. There can be no assurance that Hamas will not begin to use on a more frequent basis longer-range missiles capable of reaching our facilities, which could result in a significant disruption of the Israel-based portion of our business. Additionally, recent political events, including political uprisings, social unrest and regime change, in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa have weakened the stability of those countries, which could result in extremists coming to power, including in countries with which Israel has signed peace treaties that may not be respected by extremists. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel, and Israel is reported to be considering a pre-emptive attack on Iran, which is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any major hostilities involving Israel, including as a result of the military conflicts between the Fatah and Hamas in Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to the foregoing, since the end of 2010, numerous acts of protest and civil unrest have taken place in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, many of which involved significant violence. The civil unrest in Egypt, which borders Israel, resulted in significant changes to the country\u2019s government. In Syria, also bordering Israel, large and violent protests against the government are taking place. The ultimate effect of these developments on the political and security situation in the Middle East and on Israel\u2019s position within the region is not clear at this time.\nService of process and enforcement of civil liabilities on us and our officers may be difficult to obtain.\nWe are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and will be subject to service of process in the United States. However, approximately 17.9% of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, two of our directors and some of our executive officers are residents of Israel and a portion of the assets of such directors and executive officers are located outside the United States.\nThere is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in original actions instituted in Israel. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to enforce or effect service of process upon these directors and executive officers or to judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. laws against our assets, as well as the assets of these directors and executive officers. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Israel.\nExchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Israeli NIS may negatively affect our earnings.\nAlthough a substantial majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion of our costs, including personnel and facilities-related expenses, is incurred in New Israeli Shekels (NIS). Inflation in Israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in Israel, unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the NIS relative to the dollar. In 2014, the inflation-adjusted NIS depreciated against the dollar.", "PERMNO": 80237, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ARTX"}
