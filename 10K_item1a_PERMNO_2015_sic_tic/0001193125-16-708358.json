{"cik": "1314102", "company": "pSivida Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS\nWe will need additional capital to fund our operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe will need additional capital to fund our operations, including completing Medidur clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals and continuing our research and development program for other product candidates. In addition, if we decide to commercialize Medidur or any of these product candidates ourselves, we would incur significant expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution and other commercialization costs. We believe that our capital resources of $29.0 million at June 30, 2016, together with expected revenues from existing collaborations, should enable us to fund our operations as currently planned into the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This estimate excludes any potential net profits receipts from sales of ILUVIEN or other receipts under the Alimera collaboration agreement. We believe our ability to fund our planned operations beyond that time, including completion of clinical development of Medidur, will require additional capital from the commercialization of ILUVIEN, future collaboration or other agreements and/or financing transactions.\nThe additional capital we will require will be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nwhether, when and to what extent we receive future revenues with respect to the commercialization of ILUVIEN;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of Medidur for posterior segment uveitis and the manner in which we commercialize Medidur;\n\u2022\nwhether and to what extent we internally fund, whether and when we initiate, and how we conduct other product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe amount of Retisert royalties and other payments we receive under collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nwhether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for our product candidates and the nature of those arrangements;\n\u2022\ntimely and successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating plan, resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital; and\n\u2022\nour views on the availability, timing and desirability of raising capital.\nWe do not know if additional capital will be available to us when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Collaboration, licensing or other agreements may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We do not know when or if we will receive any substantial funds from the commercialization of ILUVIEN. If we seek to sell shares under our at-the-market (ATM) facility or in another offering, we do not know whether and to what extent we will be able to do so, or on what terms. Further, the rules and regulations of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) require us to obtain shareholder approval for sales of common stock under certain circumstances, which could delay or prevent us from raising additional capital from such sales. Also, the state of the economy and financial and credit markets at the time or times we seek any additional financing may make it more difficult or more expensive to obtain. If available, additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 equity, and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms, including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. If adequate financing is not available if and when needed, we may delay, reduce the\nscope of, or eliminate research or development programs, potential independent commercialization of Medidur or other new products, if any, postpone or cancel the pursuit of product candidates, including pre-clinical and clinical trials and new business opportunities, reduce staff and operating costs, or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital.\nWe have incurred significant losses and may never achieve profitability from operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and at June 30, 2016, we had a total accumulated deficit of $292.2 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily from payments under collaboration agreements and sales of our equity securities. We do not have any assured sources of revenue. To become and remain profitable, we and/or our licensees must succeed in developing and commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us or our licensees to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payers. To date, none of our approved licensed products, including Retisert and ILUVIEN, has generated significant revenues to us from sales. Of our product candidates, only Medidur is in late-stage clinical trials. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues significant enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately project when or if we will be able to achieve profitability from operations. Even if we do so, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations.\nThere is no assurance our Retisert royalty income will continue at current levels or at all.\nOur Retisert royalty income has ranged between $1.2 million and $1.4 million for each of the last five fiscal years. We do not expect Retisert royalty income to grow materially, if at all, and it may decline or cease. The patent with which Retisert is marked expires in March 2019, and we may not receive any Retisert royalty income after that time. Bausch & Lomb ceased selling Vitrasert on its patent expiration.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and may continue to do so in the future due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of internally funded research and development, including contract research organization (CRO) and other costs related to clinical development and costs of pre-clinical studies and research;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to our products and product candidates, both licensed and independently developed, including pre-clinical and clinical trial data and results, regulatory developments and marketing and sales results;\n\u2022\ntiming, receipt and amount of revenues, including receipt and recognition of collaborative research and development, milestone, royalty, net profits participation and other payments;\n\u2022\nannouncement, execution, amendment and termination of collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nscope, duration and success of collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific adverse economic conditions that may affect, among other things, our and our collaborators\u2019 operations and financial results; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting estimates, policies or principles and intangible asset impairments.\nDue to fluctuations in our operating results, quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not necessarily be meaningful, and investors should not rely upon such results as an indication of future performance. In addition, investors may react adversely if our reported operating results are less favorable than in a prior period or are less favorable than those anticipated by investors in the financial community, which may result in decreases in our stock price.\nIf the recorded value of our intangible assets under GAAP is impaired, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nAt June 30, 2016, we had $1.1 million of intangible assets relating to our Durasert and Tethadur technologies on our balance sheet. We conduct impairment analyses of our intangible assets as required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) and could take impairment charges in the future if the recorded values for our intangible assets were to exceed our assessment of the recoverability of the fair market value of those assets. Adverse events relating to these technologies, including the clinical development, regulatory approval and success of commercialization of products using them, and significant changes in our market capitalization could result in impairment charges. Impairment charges on our intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the quarter of the impairment.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nOur success is dependent on our ability to complete clinical development of, obtain marketing approvals for and successfully commercialize Medidur for posterior segment uveitis. If we are unable to do so, either alone or through a collaboration, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Medidur for posterior segment uveitis. Our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize Medidur. Successful commercialization of Medidur will depend on various factors, including:\n\u2022\nSuccessful completion of the clinical development of Medidur;\n\u2022\nReceipt of marketing approvals in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions and appropriate labeling;\n\u2022\nReceipt and maintenance of orphan drug designation and marketing exclusivity;\n\u2022\nThe extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nSuccessful arrangements for raw materials, manufacturing and delivery of Medidur;\n\u2022\nAdequate levels of pricing and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nEstablishing or contracting for a commercial team or establishing collaborations to successfully market and sell Medidur;\n\u2022\nCommercial acceptance by ophthalmologists, patients and third-party payers;\n\u2022\nContinued acceptable safety profile;\n\u2022\nCompetition with other products and therapies;\n\u2022\nPerformance of any collaborators; and\n\u2022\nProtection of intellectual property rights.\nIf, as a result of failure to achieve any of these or other factors, we are unable to receive marketing approval for or successfully commercialize Medidur, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf our CROs, vendors and investigators do not successfully carry out their responsibilities or if we lose our relationships with them, our development efforts with respect to our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe are dependent on CROs, vendors and investigators for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials related to our product development programs. These parties are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If they do not timely fulfill their responsibilities or if their performance is inadequate, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. The parties with which we contract for execution of clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Their failure to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our product candidates. If we lose our relationship with any one or more of these parties, we could experience a significant delay in identifying another comparable provider and contracting for its services. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, this provider may need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of service as the original provider. In addition, any provider that we retain will be subject to GLP and similar foreign standards, and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to file our MAA or NDA for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis on the schedule we have planned, which could delay the potential marketing approvals and commercialization of Medidur.\nWe are dependent on third parties to collect and analyze the data from our Medidur Phase 3 trials and Medidur inserter utilization study, and we cannot assure that they will provide the data in time for us to meet the planned filings of our MAA and NDA. Further, we need the results of our second Phase 3 trial, which requires completion of enrollment and six-month final visits with patients. There is no assurance that we will reach the six-month primary endpoint of that trial on the schedule required to meet our planned filing schedule. Failure to file for our applications for marketing approvals on our planned schedule could delay the potential receipt of those approvals and the commercialization of Medidur.\nThere is no assurance that data we plan to submit in support of our planned MAA and NDA for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis will be acceptable to the EMA or the FDA and accordingly that Medidur\u2019s European or U.S. marketing authorization will be granted.\nWe plan to file our MAA for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis based on data from our first Phase 3 trial rather than two Phase 3 trials as a result of the high statistical significance of the top-line results achieved in our first trial. The MHRA advised us that, consistent with the published PtC of the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products, an application for a product treating a condition like posterior segment uveitis could be based on statistically compelling and clinically relevant results from just one pivotal trial. The MHRA provided this advice without reviewing the results of our first Phase 3 trial, which had not been completed at the time. There can be no assurance that the results from our first Phase 3 trial will satisfy the standards of the PtC or provide the data necessary for marketing approval in Europe, and data from our second Phase 3 trial or other data could be required.\nWe plan to file our NDA for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis on results from our two Phase 3 trials. While our first Phase 3 trial of Medidur for posterior segment uveitis met its primary efficacy endpoint with high statistical significance and showed encouraging safety results, there is no assurance that the second trial will achieve the same or comparable results to the first trial or provide the evidence of safety and efficacy required to file an NDA for approval of Medidur by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Further, we are conducting our second Phase 3 trial of Medidur in India. In general, the FDA accepts data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S.; however, acceptance of this data is subject to, among other things, the clinical trials being conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with GCP principles, the trial population must also\nadequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while our second Phase 3 clinical trial is subject to applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data from the trial will depend on its determination that it also was conducted in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations.\nWe plan to submit data from our new inserter utilization study in support of both our MAA and NDA. The EMA or the FDA may require an additional study of our inserter.\nThe FDA has significant discretion in determining whether to accept an NDA for review and what data to require for review, and there is no assurance that the FDA will find the design of our clinical trials or the data we include in an NDA to be sufficient to accept the NDA for review or to approve the NDA. The EMA has comparable discretion with respect to MAAs. The refusal of the FDA or the EMA to accept our marketing applications for review or their requirements for additional data or trials could delay the timing, increase the expense or render impractical continued pursuit of potential marketing approval of Medidur for posterior segment uveitis. Delay in or inability to obtain marketing approvals for Medidur could materially and adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nWe may not maintain our European orphan product designation for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis or obtain orphan designation in the U.S. and as a result, may not have the benefits of that designation.\nMedidur has been designated as an orphan medicinal product in Europe. However, at the time we apply for marketing authorization, we must also submit a request for maintenance of the orphan designation to determine whether Medidur will maintain its status as an orphan medicine and receive market exclusivity and other benefits. Review of the maintenance of orphan designation is based on data on the then current prevalence of posterior segment uveitis; the then current life-threatening or debilitating nature of posterior segment uveitis; other methods for its diagnosis, prevention or treatment; and if applicable, a justification of Medidur\u2019s significant benefit. This review is carried out independently of, but in parallel to, the evaluation of the marketing authorization application. There is no assurance that Medidur will maintain its orphan medicinal status in Europe. Further, our ability to obtain orphan status for Medidur in the U.S. in uncertain, and there is no assurance we will be able to do so.\nOff-label sales of ILUVIEN to treat posterior segment uveitis may adversely affect sales of Medidur, if approved.\nThe micro-inserts that comprise ILUVIEN and Medidur have substantially the same design, polymers and release rate, and both deliver the corticosteroid FAc. Although Medidur is administered with a smaller gauge needle and delivers a somewhat lower dose of FAc than ILUVIEN, ILUVIEN is already approved and marketed. It is possible that physicians will prescribe ILUVIEN for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis on an off-label basis, which could adversely affect the sales of Medidur, if approved.\nThere is no assurance that Alimera will successfully commercialize ILUVIEN for DME or that we will receive any significant revenues from its commercialization.\nWe are entitled to a net profit participation on a country-by-country and quarter-by-quarter basis on sales of ILUVIEN where Alimera markets ILUVIEN directly and to a percentage of royalties and non-royalty consideration where Alimera sublicenses the marketing of ILUVIEN. The commercialization of ILUVIEN is a significant undertaking by Alimera, and ILUVIEN for DME is Alimera\u2019s first and only commercial product. Alimera\u2019s sales of ILUVIEN have not been significant to date, Alimera has continued to incur operating losses, and it has violated and in the future may violate the financial covenants of its loan agreement. We do not know if, when, or to what extent we will receive future revenues from the commercialization of ILUVIEN for DME. The amount and timing of any revenues we receive will be affected by many factors including:\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s and its distributors\u2019 and sublicensees\u2019 ability to effectively market and sell ILUVIEN in each country where sold;\n\u2022\nthe manner of sale, whether directly by Alimera or by sublicensees or distributors, and the terms of sublicensing and distribution agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of sales of ILUVIEN in each country;\n\u2022\ncommercialization costs;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals, appropriate labeling, and desirable pricing, insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\ncommencement of marketing in additional countries; and\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to raise adequate capital as needed to fund its operations and to maintain compliance with its loan agreement.\nIf Alimera is not successful in commercializing ILUVIEN for DME, it would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAlimera needs alternative financing to replace its $35.0 million debt facility or additional capital to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under its loan agreement, which Alimera may be unable to obtain, and Alimera\u2019s continued losses and financial condition may cast doubt on its ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nAlthough Alimera launched ILUVIEN in Germany and the U.K. in the second quarter of 2013 and in the U.S. and Portugal in the first quarter of 2015, Alimera had accumulated a deficit of $361.9 million through June 30, 2016. Alimera has not generated revenues that cover its actual or anticipated expenses and cannot project the extent of its future losses. Alimera expects to continue to incur substantial losses, and as a result, is unable to predict when or if it will achieve or sustain profitability. Alimera\u2019s ability to achieve profitability and generate net profit payments to us is dependent on its ability to successfully market and sell ILUVIEN.\nAlimera failed to meet a revenue threshold in January 2016 and a liquidity threshold as of June 30, 2016 under the financial covenants of its loan agreement. While these failures were subsequently waived by the lender, Alimera was required to pay substantial amounts and grant concessions in connection with these waivers. Alimera reported that based on its financial forecast for the remainder of 2016, it must obtain additional or alternative financing or it is probable that Alimera will not be able to comply with the modified financial covenants under its loan agreement. Alimera is pursuing alternative or additional debt financing (including a recently completed common stock offering raising $25.1 million in net proceeds, which Alimera reported would be used to fund the commercialization of ILUVIEN and other corporate purposes), and has an at-the-market offering in place for possible sales of its common stock. If Alimera is not successful in raising the capital it requires and defaults on its obligations under its loan agreement, its lender may call the loan, which could require Alimera to pay back the entire amount owed and pay an early termination fee, or if the lender does not call the loan, Alimera may have to pay an increased rate of interest, pay additional monetary amounts in exchange for a waiver or modification of the loan agreement, or grant additional equity or warrant coverage and agree to further restrictions on its operations that could hinder it in the future. Alimera\u2019s failure to comply with the covenants under the loan agreement could create substantial doubt about Alimera\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to market and sell ILUVIEN. The termination provisions of our agreement with Alimera include various bankruptcy events.\nFurther, due to the limited revenue generated by ILUVIEN to date, even if Alimera is able to refinance its loan agreement and maintain compliance with its covenants, Alimera will need to raise additional capital to fund the continued commercialization of ILUVIEN. If Alimera is unable to raise sufficient additional financing, it may need to adjust its commercial plans, which likely would adversely affect Alimera\u2019s ability to market ILUVIEN and make any potential payments to us.\nSales of ILUVIEN for DME may be materially adversely affected by pricing and reimbursement decisions of regulatory bodies, insurers and others.\nPrices, coverage and reimbursement to consumers of ILUVIEN for DME, like other drugs, are generally regulated by third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities and plans, private health insurers and other organizations and affect ILUVIEN\u2019s sales. The timing and complexity of those reimbursements also affect sales. Prices in the EU are generally lower and coverage and access to drugs more limited than in the U.S. For example, in the U.K. and Scotland, National Health Service coverage is limited to the treatment of the eyes of chronic DME patients unresponsive to existing therapies that have undergone cataract surgery, subject to simple patient access schemes. Alimera may not achieve satisfactory agreements with statutory or other insurers. We do not know what levels of pricing will be approved or reimbursed for ILUVIEN, or what restrictions will be placed on its use or reuse in countries where ILUVIEN is not currently sold. In the U.S., Alimera has offered extended customer payment terms. Future sales of ILUVIEN and, accordingly, our net profits share, may be adversely affected by pricing and reimbursement decisions, and such effects may be material.\nThe micro-insert for ILUVIEN and Medidur delivers FAc, a corticosteroid that is associated with certain adverse side effects in the eye, which may affect the success of this micro-insert for treatment of DME and posterior segment uveitis.\nThe micro-insert for both ILUVIEN and Medidur delivers the non-proprietary corticosteroid FAc, which is associated with cataract formation and elevated IOP and may increase the risk of glaucoma and related surgery to manage those side effects. These side effects shown in the Phase 3 trials for ILUVIEN resulted in limitations to the approved indications of ILUVIEN, and sales of ILUVIEN may be adversely affected by the potential side effects from FAc relative to other treatments for DME. The extent of ILUVIEN\u2019s long-term side-effect profile beyond month 36 is not yet known. Alimera is conducting a five-year post-authorization, open label registry study of the safety of ILUVIEN in 800 patients treated with the European labeled indication, which was a condition of European approval. Data from this study or other commercial experience could result in the withdrawal of ILUVIEN\u2019s marketing approval in one or more jurisdictions. Further, delay in the commercial launch of ILUVIEN could result in the withdrawal of marketing or regulatory authorization for ILUVIEN in jurisdictions where ILUVIEN has already received marketing authorization. In addition, the perception by physicians of this benefit of efficacy versus the side-effect profile could adversely affect sales of ILUVIEN.\nMedidur achieved encouraging safety results through the last follow-up visit in its first Phase 3 trial. However, there is no assurance that encouraging safety results will continue in that trial, or that the second Phase 3 trial will yield encouraging safety results. There is also no assurance that the overall risk-benefit profile for Medidur will be favorable or that Medidur will be determined to be safe for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis in light of potential side effects from FAc. These side effects may limit the population for which marketing authorization is granted or for which reimbursement is provided in one or more jurisdictions and/or adversely affect sales of Medidur, if approved.\nThere is no assurance that payment of ILUVIEN net profits to us for 2014 as the result of an independent audit will be upheld or that we will receive any future payments of ILUVIEN net profits to which we believe we are entitled without future independent audits or at all.\nWhile the independent audit firm that audited Alimera\u2019s commercialization reporting for 2014 concluded that Alimera over-reported commercialization expenses and accordingly under-reported net profits payable to us, Alimera has sought to challenge those findings in arbitration, and if that challenge is allowed to go forward, may prevail in its efforts to overturn all or part of the audit firm\u2019s conclusions. Depending upon the outcome of the arbitration, conclusions of the independent audit firm with respect to some commercialization expenses for 2014 may also affect other periods. As a result, there is no assurance that we will receive net profits payments to\nwhich we believe we are entitled in accordance with the Alimera Agreement. Moreover, we may in the future challenge Alimera\u2019s reporting under the Alimera Agreement, which may result in future independent audits and arbitration, the outcome of which may or may not be favorable to us.\nThere is no assurance that Pfizer will exercise its option with respect to the Latanoprost Product if we initiate and complete Phase 2 trials or cease development, in which case we will not receive any further financial consideration under the Restated Pfizer Agreement.\nPfizer has an option for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product if we complete Phase 2 clinical trials, which are at our option and expense, or we cease development at any time prior to completion of those trials. There is no assurance that we will commence or complete Phase 2 clinical trials for the Latanoprost Product; that, if completed, the trials will be successful; that Pfizer will exercise its option whether we complete Phase 2 trials or cease development; that, if exercised, Pfizer will commence or complete Phase 3 clinical trials; or that the Latanoprost Product will achieve successful Phase 3 trial results, regulatory approvals or commercial success. As a result, there is no assurance that we will receive any further licensing, milestone or royalty payments under the Restated Pfizer Agreement.\nWe do not know if we will be able to deliver proteins (including antibodies) and peptides with our Tethadur technology or that we will be able to develop product candidates or approved products using this technology.\nAlthough we have continued to make advances in our development of Tethadur and are optimistic that our Tethadur technology platform can provide sustained delivery of proteins (including antibodies) and peptides, our research continues to be at an early stage, and we face challenges. Development of any product candidates utilizing Tethadur is expected to require significant additional research and funding. There is no assurance that we will continue our development of Tethadur, that subsequent research will be successful or that we will be able to develop product candidates or approved products using Tethadur to deliver proteins and peptides.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we consolidated all of our research and development work in our U.S. laboratory facility, closed our U.K. research facility, where much of our Tethadur research was previously conducted, and have terminated the employment of our U.K.-based employees who performed much of the pre-clinical research of Tethadur. There is no assurance that we will successfully transition the research and development of Tethadur to the U.S. or that we will not experience delays as a result of this consolidation.\nWe do not know if our product candidate for severe knee osteoarthritis in collaboration with HSS will be safe and effective, will ever enter pivotal clinical trials or will become an approved product or be commercialized.\nOur product candidate for severe knee osteoarthritis in collaboration with HSS is the subject of an investigator-sponsored, open-label, one-dose, safety and tolerability study. We do not know what the results of that study will be, whether we will be able to develop a product candidate for this indication to eventually enter pivotal Phase 3 trials, whether we will commence or successfully complete any such trials or whether we will obtain regulatory approvals for a product for this indication. Although we believe we will be able to do so, there is no assurance that we will be able to design a product with a longer treatment duration than six months, that we will be able to create a refillable implant or that the product, even if successful for severe knee osteoarthritis, can be extended to treat osteoarthritis of any other joint. In addition, the study for this product candidate is being conducted by an investigator, and we do not control that trial as we would if we were conducting the trial ourselves. We have no agreement with HSS to develop this product beyond the completion of this study, and there is no assurance that we will reach such an agreement. If we do not do so, there is a risk that the intellectual property of HSS and joint intellectual property developed in the course of our collaboration with HSS or future actions by HSS will interfere with our ability to develop and market an OA implant.\nProduct development is very uncertain. If we do not develop product candidates to enter clinical trials, if we or any licensees do not initiate or complete clinical trials for our product candidates or if our product candidates do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, neither we nor any licensees will be able to commercialize those product candidates and generate revenues for us.\nOther than Medidur for posterior segment uveitis, which is in pivotal Phase 3 trials, all of our product development is at earlier stages. Product development at all stages involves a high degree of risk, and only a small proportion of research and development programs result in product candidates that advance to pivotal clinical trials or result in approved products. For example, although we have completed favorable pre-clinical tests of a TKI to treat wet AMD, there is additional pre-clinical research to be completed and there is no assurance that we will develop a TKI product to advance to clinical trials. There is no assurance that any feasibility study agreements we have, or enter into, with third parties, or our own research and development programs and collaborations will result in any new product candidates, or that we or any licensees will commence clinical trials for any new product candidates or continue clinical trials once commenced. If clinical trials conducted by or for us or any licensees for any product candidates do not provide the necessary evidence of safety and efficacy, those product candidates will not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, cannot be sold, and will not generate revenues for us. Initial or subsequent clinical trials may not be initiated by or for us or any licensees for product candidates or may be delayed, terminated or fail due to many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\ndecisions not to pursue development of product candidates due to pre-clinical or clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient funding;\n\u2022\ninability to attract clinical investigators for trials;\n\u2022\ninability to recruit patients in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate;\n\u2022\ndecisions by licensees not to exercise options for products or not to pursue or promote products licensed to them;\n\u2022\nadverse side effects;\n\u2022\nfailure of trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet FDA or other regulatory agency requirements for clinical trial design, or inadequate clinical trial design;\n\u2022\ninability to follow patients adequately after treatment;\n\u2022\nchanges in the design or manufacture of a product;\n\u2022\nfailures by, changes in our (or our licensees\u2019) relationship with, or other issues at, CROs, vendors and investigators responsible for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain supplies and/or to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nstability issues with clinical materials;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with GLP, GCP, cGMP or similar foreign regulatory requirements that affect the conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and the manufacturing of products;\n\u2022\nrequests by regulatory authorities for additional data or clinical trials;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory agency assessments of pre-clinical or clinical testing that differ from our (or our licensees\u2019) interpretations or conclusions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays, or changes in approval policies or regulations; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments, clinical trial results and other factors with respect to competitive products and treatments.\nResults from pre-clinical testing, early clinical trials, investigator-sponsored studies and other data and indications often do not accurately predict final pivotal clinical trial results. In addition, data from one pivotal clinical trial may not be predictive of the results of other pivotal clinical trials for the same product candidate, even if the trial designs are the same or similar. Data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Data from pre-clinical studies, other clinical trials and interim periods in multi-year trials are preliminary and may change, and final data from pivotal trials for such products may differ significantly. Adverse side effects may develop that delay, limit or prevent the regulatory approval of products, or cause such regulatory approvals to be limited or even rescinded. Additional trials necessary for approval may not be undertaken or may ultimately fail to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.\nThe FDA or other relevant regulatory agencies may not approve our product candidates for manufacture and sale, and any approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by other regulatory agencies or vice versa (which could require us to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements, possibly including additional clinical testing). Any product approvals we or our licensees achieve could also be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory standards or due to unforeseen problems after the product\u2019s marketing approval. In either case, marketing efforts with respect to the affected product would have to cease. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. The imposition by the FDA or other regulatory organizations of any such limitations on the indicated uses for which any of our products may be marketed would reduce the size of, or otherwise limit, the potential market for the product subject to such limitations.\nIn addition to testing, regulatory agencies impose various requirements on manufacturers and sellers of products under their jurisdiction, such as packaging, labeling, manufacturing practices, record keeping and reporting. Regulatory agencies may also require post-marketing testing and surveillance programs to monitor a product\u2019s effects. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals.\nWe do not currently have sales and marketing capacity. There is no assurance that we will have the financial resources to develop the capacity to, or be able to, successfully market and sell Medidur for posterior segment uveitis or any other products if we seek to do so.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales capability, our approved products are commercialized by others, and we have no experience in commercializing products. We face the decision of how to commercialize Medidur for posterior segment uveitis, if approved. We do not know if we will decide to directly commercialize Medidur or any other products ourselves. Direct commercialization would require us to develop sales and marketing capability and to make a significant financial investment. If we decide to independently and directly commercialize a product in one or more countries, there is no assurance we will be able to hire and manage a successful sales and marketing capability or have the financial resources necessary to fund independent commercialization of any products in any country.\nThe success of our current and possible future collaborative and licensing arrangements depends and will depend heavily on the experience, resources, efforts and activities of our licensees, and if they are not successful in developing and marketing our products, it will adversely affect our revenues, if any, from those products.\nOur business strategy includes continuing to leverage our technology platforms by entering into collaborative and licensing arrangements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, where appropriate. The success of current and future collaborative and licensing arrangements do and will depend heavily on the experience, resources, skill, efforts and activities of our licensees. Our licensees have had, and are expected to have, significant discretion in making decisions related to the development of product\ncandidates and the commercialization of products under these collaboration agreements. Risks that we face in connection with our collaboration and licensing strategy include the following:\n\u2022\nour collaborative and licensing arrangements are, and are expected to be, subject to termination under various circumstances, including on short notice and without cause;\n\u2022\nwe are required, and expect to be required, under our collaborative and licensing arrangements, not to conduct specified types of research and development in the field that is the subject of the arrangement or not to sell products in such field, limiting the areas of research, development and commercialization that we can pursue;\n\u2022\nour licensees may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products that are similar to or competitive with our products;\n\u2022\nour licensees may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or decrease or fail to increase spending related to our products or product candidates, thereby limiting the ability of these products to reach their potential;\n\u2022\nour licensees may lack the funding, personnel or experience to develop and commercialize our products successfully or may otherwise fail to do so; and\n\u2022\nour licensees may not perform their obligations, in whole or in part.\nWe currently have collaboration and licensing arrangements with various companies, most significantly Alimera and Bausch & Lomb. While Bausch & Lomb has significant experience in the ophthalmic field and substantial resources, there is no assurance whether, and to what extent, that experience and those resources will be devoted to Retisert, and we do not expect revenues from Retisert to increase materially, and they may decline. Although we believe potential revenues from ILUVIEN for DME are important to our future results of operations and financial condition, Alimera has limited experience and limited financial resources, and ILUVIEN for DME is Alimera\u2019s first and only commercial product. Alimera has reported that its negative cash flows from operations and accumulated deficit may raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Further, due to the limited revenue generated by Alimera to date, Alimera may not be able to maintain compliance with covenants under its loan agreement and, in the event of a default, we do not know whether Alimera will be able to obtain amendments or waivers of those covenants. We do not know if Alimera will be able to raise additional financing if and when required.\nIf our current and future licensees are not successful in developing and marketing our products, it will adversely affect our revenues, if any, from those products.\nOur current licensees may terminate their agreements with us at any time or fail to fulfill their obligations under those agreements, and, if they do, we will lose the benefits of those agreements.\nOur licensees have rights of termination under our agreements with them and could terminate those agreements without cause on short notice. Further, our licensees may fail to fulfill their obligations under their agreements, or we may disagree with them over the rights and obligations under those agreements, which could result in breach of the agreements and/or termination. Exercise of termination rights by one or more of our licensees or by us may leave us without the financial benefits and development, marketing or sales resources provided under the terminated agreement. It could be necessary for us to replace, or seek to provide ourselves, the services provided by the licensee, and there is no assurance we would be successful in doing so. It could delay, impair or stop the development or commercialization of products or product candidates licensed to them or require significant additional capital investment by us, which we may not have the resources to fund. If any of our licensees do not perform their obligations under our agreements or if any of those agreements are terminated, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf competitive products receive regulatory approval or reach the market earlier, are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more effectively marketed or cost less than our products or product candidates, our products or product candidates may not be approved, may not achieve the sales we anticipate and could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe believe that pharmaceutical, drug delivery and biotechnology companies, research organizations, governmental entities, universities, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations and individual scientists are seeking to develop drugs, therapies, products, approaches or methods to treat our targeted diseases or their underlying causes. For our targeted diseases, competitors have alternate therapies that are already commercialized or are in various stages of development, ranging from discovery to advanced clinical trials. Any of these drugs, therapies, products, approaches or methods may receive government approval or gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products and product candidates, may offer therapeutic or cost advantages, or may more effectively treat our targeted diseases or their underlying causes, which could result in our product candidates not being approved, reduce demand for our products and product candidates or render them noncompetitive or obsolete.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. Our competitors may succeed in developing alternate technologies and products that, in comparison to the products we have and are seeking to develop:\n\u2022\nare more effective and easier to use;\n\u2022\nare more economical;\n\u2022\nhave fewer side effects;\n\u2022\noffer other benefits; or\n\u2022\nmay otherwise render our products less competitive or obsolete.\nMany of these competitors have greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances and manufacturing and marketing products than we do.\nOur products and product candidates may not achieve and maintain market acceptance and may never generate significant revenues.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, the commercial success of our products and product candidates will require not only obtaining regulatory approvals, but also obtaining market acceptance by retinal specialists and other doctors, patients, government health administration authorities and other third-party payers. Whether and to what extent our products and product candidates achieve and maintain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including demonstrated safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, potential advantages over other therapies, our and our collaborative partners\u2019 marketing and distribution efforts and the reimbursement policies and determinations of government and other third-party payers. In particular, if governments, private insurers, governmental insurers and other third-party payers do not recommend our products and product candidates, limit the indications for which they are recommended, do not provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement levels for our products or limit the frequency of administration, the market acceptance of our products and product candidates will be limited. Governments, governmental insurers, private insurers and other third-party payers attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for products and, accordingly, they may challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of our products, or refuse to provide coverage for our products. If our products and product candidates fail to achieve and maintain market acceptance, they may fail to generate significant revenues and our business may be significantly harmed.\nGuidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations could reduce the use of our products and potential use of product candidates.\nGovernment agencies, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations focused on various diseases may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies\nthat affect our or our competitors\u2019 products and product candidates. Any such guidelines, recommendations or studies that reflect negatively on our products or product candidates, either directly or relative to our competitive products, could result in current or potential decreased use, sales of, and revenues from one or more of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, our success depends in part on our and our partners\u2019 ability to educate healthcare providers and patients about our products and product candidates, and these education efforts could be rendered ineffective by, among other things, third-parties\u2019 guidelines, recommendations or studies.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe rely heavily upon patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies. If we fail to protect our intellectual property or infringe on others\u2019 technologies, our ability to develop and market our products and product candidates may be compromised.\nOur success is dependent on whether we can obtain patents, defend our existing patents and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. As of August 31, 2016, we had 233 patents and 107 pending patent applications, including patents and pending applications covering our Durasert, Tethadur and other technologies. Intellectual property protection of our technologies is uncertain. We expect to seek to patent and protect our proprietary technologies. However, there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued to us as a result of our pending or future patent applications or that any of our patents will withstand challenges by others. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to patent and protect our proprietary technologies to the extent that we would desire, or at all. If we were determined to be infringing any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, pay royalties or cease certain operations. We may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all. In addition, many foreign country laws may treat the protection of proprietary rights differently from, and may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as, laws in the U.S. and Patent Cooperation Treaty countries.\nPrior art may reduce the scope or protection of, or invalidate, our patents. Previously conducted research or published discoveries may prevent our patents from being granted, invalidate issued patents or narrow the scope of any protection obtained. Reduction in scope of protection or invalidation of our licensed or owned patents, or our inability to obtain patents, may enable other companies to develop products that compete with our products and product candidates on the basis of the same or similar technology. As a result, our patents and those of our licensors may not provide any, or sufficient, protection against competitors. While we have not been, and are not currently, involved in any litigation over intellectual property, such litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. We may also be sued by one or more third parties alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation would likely result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our efforts, and could prevent or delay our discovery or development of product candidates. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us, and if they prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. or other jurisdictions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the appropriate foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our efforts. Any such litigation or interference proceedings, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive and time consuming. Litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, requiring disputed rights to be licensed from third parties and/or requiring us to cease using certain technologies.\nWe have entered into many agreements that limit our or the third parties\u2019 rights with respect to our intellectual property, including rights to use, options on rights to use, or prohibitions on rights to use (including noncompetition obligations) our or jointly developed intellectual property. Those rights could adversely affect our rights to develop and commercialize products utilizing our intellectual property.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology that are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our corporate partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. Any of these\nparties could breach these agreements and disclose our confidential information, or our competitors may learn of the information in some other way. If any material trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be materially harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS\nIf we fail to retain key personnel, our business could suffer.\nWe are dependent upon the principal members of our management and scientific staff. In addition, we believe that our future success in developing and marketing our products will depend on whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel as well as a sales and marketing staff. There is strong competition for qualified personnel within the industry in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain such personnel. As we have a small number of employees and we believe our products are unique and highly specialized, the loss of the services of one or more of the principal members of our management or scientific staff, or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel and develop expertise as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are subject to product liability suits, we may not have sufficient insurance to cover damages.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of the products utilizing our technologies involve risks that product liability claims may be asserted against us and/or our licensees. Our current clinical trial and product liability insurance may not be adequate to cover damages resulting from product liability claims. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could require us to spend significant time, money and other resources to defend such claims, could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, or result in reputational harm, and could result in the payment of a significant damage award. Our product liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and may not be adequate in scope to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim. Further, we may not be able to acquire sufficient clinical trial or product liability insurance in the future on reasonable commercial terms, if at all.\nConsolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may adversely affect us.\nThere has been consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Consolidation could result in the remaining companies having greater financial resources and technological capabilities, thus intensifying competition, and fewer potential collaboration partners or licensees for our product candidates. In addition, if a consolidating company is already doing business with any of our competitors, we could lose existing or potential future licensees or collaboration partners as a result of such consolidation.\nIf we or our licensees fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, our or their ability to manufacture and commercialize products may be adversely affected.\nMedical and biopharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as radioactive compounds and chemical solvents. We and our licensees are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and waste products. We and they could be subject to both criminal liability and civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us or them for resulting injury or contamination, and the liability may exceed our or their ability to pay. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair the research, development or production efforts of our company or our licensees and harm our operating results.\nIf we or our licensees encounter problems with product manufacturing, there could be delays in product development or commercialization, which would adversely affect our future profitability.\nOur ability and that of our licensees to conduct timely pre-clinical and clinical research and development programs, obtain regulatory approvals, and develop and commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, upon our and our licensees\u2019 ability to manufacture our products and product candidates, either directly or through third parties, in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. The manufacture, packaging and testing of our products and product candidates are regulated by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities and must be conducted in accordance with applicable cGMP and comparable foreign requirements. Any change in a manufacturing process or procedure used for one of our products or product candidates, including a change in the location at which a product or product candidate is being manufactured or in the third-party manufacturer being used, may require the FDA\u2019s and similar foreign regulatory entities\u2019 prior review and/or approval in accordance with applicable cGMP or other regulations. Additionally, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for the manufacture, packaging and testing of products at any time.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP and other foreign regulations that are both capable of manufacturing our products and product candidates and are willing to do so. Alimera has contracted with individual third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of ILUVIEN and its components. If any of Alimera\u2019s third-party manufacturers breach their agreements or are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason or fail to comply with cGMP and comparable foreign requirements, Alimera may not be able to locate alternative acceptable manufacturers, enter into favorable agreements with them or get them approved by the applicable regulatory authorities in a timely manner. Delays in the commercial production of ILUVIEN could delay or impair Alimera\u2019s marketing of ILUVIEN, which, in turn, could adversely affect Alimera\u2019s generation of net profits for us.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial quantities of our product candidates, including Medidur. If Medidur or any other of our product candidates is approved, we do not intend to build our own commercial manufacturing facilities and would need to arrange for manufacture by contract manufacturers. There is no assurance that we will be able to arrange for the manufacture of Medidur or any other product on satisfactory terms or that any contract manufacturer will supply any such products on a timely manner and in compliance with applicable regulations.\nFailure by us, our collaborative partners, or our or their third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable manufacturing requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or our collaborative partners, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. In addition, we or our collaborative partners may not be able to manufacture our product candidates successfully or have a third party manufacture them in a cost-effective manner. If we or our collaborative partners are unable to develop our own manufacturing facilities or to obtain or retain third-party manufacturing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to conduct certain future pre-clinical and clinical testing or to supply commercial quantities of our products. We manufacture supplies in connection with pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted by us and our licensees. Our licensees have the exclusive rights to manufacture commercial quantities of products, once approved for marketing. Our and our licensees\u2019 reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties to comply with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations and to employ adequate quality assurance practices;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain the materials necessary to produce a product or to formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredient on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nsupply disruption, deterioration in product quality or breach of a manufacturing or license agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our or our licensees\u2019 control;\n\u2022\ntermination or non-renewal of a manufacturing or licensing agreement with a third party at a time that is costly or difficult; and\n\u2022\ninability to identify or qualify an alternative manufacturer in a timely manner, even if contractually permitted to do so.\nProblems associated with international business operations could affect our or our licensees\u2019 ability to manufacture and sell our products. If we encounter such problems, our or their costs could increase and development of products could be delayed.\nOur goal is to develop products for sale by us and our licensees in major world healthcare markets. Manufacturing of pharmaceutical products requires us or our licensees to comply with regulations regarding safety and quality and to obtain country and jurisdiction-specific regulatory approvals and clearances. We or our licensees may not be able to comply with such regulations or obtain or maintain needed regulatory approvals and clearances, or may be required to incur significant costs in doing so. In addition, our operations and future revenues may be subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce, including the following:\n\u2022\nstaffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nforeign tax laws, tariffs and freight rates and charges;\n\u2022\ntiming and availability of export licenses;\n\u2022\ninadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\nobtaining required government approvals.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the U.K.\u2019s likely exit from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a non-binding referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), the announcement of which caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Pound Sterling currency in which we conduct certain business activity. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the U.K. government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, which may amplify the adverse effects experienced to date.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU may have and how such withdrawal may affect us. Potential volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the Pound Sterling or other currencies may adversely affect our operating results and expose us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU may create economic uncertainty, which may reduce sales of our licensed products. A U.K. withdrawal from the EU may, among other things, increase regulatory complexities, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in Europe, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. It raises uncertainty, for example, as to the regulatory path for marketing approval of Medidur in the U.K.\nIf the U.K. were to significantly alter its laws or regulations affecting the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries, we could face significant new costs and uncertainties Altered regulations could add time and expense to the process by which our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the U.K. and the EU. Similarly, it is unclear at this time what impact Brexit will have on our intellectual property rights and the process for obtaining and defending such rights.\nLegislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nOur industry is highly regulated and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, and new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and judicial decisions, may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nU.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA), represents one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The PPACA is intended to expand U.S. healthcare coverage primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. Several provisions of the PPACA could significantly reduce payments from Medicare and Medicaid for any product candidates that obtain marketing approval in the future. Federal and state legislatures within the U.S. and foreign governments will likely continue to consider changes in existing healthcare legislation. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any products for which we or our licensees may obtain regulatory approval; our or our licensees\u2019 ability to set a price that we or they believe is fair for our products; our or our licensees\u2019 ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product; our or our licensees\u2019 ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; or the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA. The Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The BCA, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013. More recent legislation extends reductions through 2024. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the BCA, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.\nThe FDAAA granted the FDA enhanced authority over products already approved for sale, including authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this relatively new authority could result in delays and increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, increased costs following regulatory approval to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on the sale or distribution of approved products following regulatory approval.\nChanges in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. For example, the July 9, 2012 reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) extended by two months the period in which the FDA is expected to review and approve certain NDAs. Although the FDA has recently stated that it expects to meet PDUFA\u2019s updated timing goals, it has in the past provided its managers discretion to miss them due to heightened agency workload or understaffing in the review divisions. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether and to what extent the FDA will adhere to PDUFA timing goals in the future, which could delay approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock (including common stock represented by CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs)) may be affected by developments directly affecting our business, as well as by developments out of our\ncontrol or not specific to us. The biotechnology sector, in particular, and the stock market generally are vulnerable to abrupt changes in investor sentiment. Prices of securities and trading volumes of companies in the biotechnology industry, including ours, can swing dramatically in ways unrelated to, or that bear a disproportionate relationship to, our performance. The price of our common stock (and CDIs) and their trading volumes may fluctuate based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nclinical trials and their results, and other product and technological developments and innovations;\n\u2022\nFDA and other domestic and international governmental regulatory actions, receipt and timing of approvals of our product candidates, and any denials and withdrawal of approvals;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors, including the commercialization of new products in our markets by our competitors;\n\u2022\nadvancements with respect to treatment of the diseases targeted by our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to, and actions by, our collaborative partners, including execution, amendment and termination of agreements, achievement of milestones and receipt of payments;\n\u2022\nthe success of our collaborative partners in marketing any approved products and the amount and timing of payments to us;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital and our financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nactions with respect to pricing, reimbursement and coverage, and changes in reimbursement policies or other practices relating to our products or the pharmaceutical industry generally;\n\u2022\nmeeting, exceeding or failing to meet analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, and changes in evaluations and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\neconomic, industry and market conditions, changes or trends; and\n\u2022\nother factors unrelated to us or the biotechnology industry.\nIn addition, low trading volume in our common stock or our CDIs may increase their price volatility. Holders of our common stock and CDIs may not be able to liquidate their positions at the desired time or price. Finally, we will need to continue to meet the listing requirements of NASDAQ, including the minimum stock price, and ASX, for our stock and CDIs to continue to be traded on those exchanges, respectively.\nIf the holders of our outstanding warrants and stock options exercise their warrants and options, ownership of our common stock holders may be diluted, and our stock price may decline.\nAs of August 31, 2016, we had outstanding warrants and options to acquire approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 16.2% of our shares on a fully diluted basis. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of these warrants and stock options could result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nAt the present time, we intend to use available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the discretion of our board of directors, no cash dividends on our common shares have been declared or paid by us and we have no intention of paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 90542, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EYPT"}
