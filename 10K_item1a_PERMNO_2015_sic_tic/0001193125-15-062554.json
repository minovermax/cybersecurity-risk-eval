{"cik": "1366684", "company": "HOMEAWAY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract and maintain a critical mass of vacation rental listings and travelers, whether due to competition or other factors, our marketplace will become less valuable to property owners and managers and to travelers, and our revenue and net income could decrease materially.\nMost of our revenue is generated when owners or managers of vacation rentals pay us listing fees, by subscription or a booking commission, to list and market vacation rentals to travelers who visit our online marketplace. Accordingly, our success primarily depends on our ability to attract owners, managers, travelers and advertisers to our marketplace. If property owners and managers choose not to market their vacation rentals through our websites, or instead list them with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of vacation properties to attract travelers to our websites. Similarly, our volume of new listings and listing renewals may suffer if we are unable to attract travelers to our websites. If we are unable to attract owners and travelers to our websites, advertisers may not purchase display advertising on our websites. As a result of any of these events, the perceived usefulness of our online marketplace is likely to decline, and our revenue and net income could decrease materially.\nOur business depends substantially on property owners and managers renewing their subscription listings. Because we recognize revenue over the term of the applicable agreement, the lack of subscription-based listing renewals may not immediately be reflected in our operating results.\nOur business depends substantially on property owners and managers renewing their subscription listings. Any decline in our subscription listing renewals could harm our operating results. Property owners and managers generally market their vacation rentals on our websites pursuant to prepaid annual subscription listings with no obligation to renew. We may be unable to predict future listing renewal rates accurately, and our renewal rates may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors. These factors include property owners\u2019 decisions to sell or to cease renting their properties, their decisions to use the services of our competitors, or their dissatisfaction with our pricing, products, services or websites. Property owners and managers may not establish or renew subscription listings if we cannot generate visits from large numbers of travelers seeking, inquiring about or booking vacation rentals.\nIn addition, from time to time we make changes that impact our customers, including changes to listings\u2019 available features, the software tools we offer owners and managers in their operations, our pricing, and the algorithms that determine the listings\u2019 ranking in search query results. While such changes may be intended to improve customer satisfaction, there can be no guarantee that the changes will perform as expected or that property owners and managers will react positively and continue to renew their listings. For example, we offer different subscription levels on many of our websites and property owners and managers may not be satisfied with the subscription level they purchase. We also offer on certain websites the ability for property owners and managers to list on a commission basis without paying a subscription fee. Subscription-based customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions and list on a commission basis, which could result in decreased revenue. If property owners and managers do not renew their subscription listings at the same level or at all, or if we are forced to offer renewals on less favorable terms, our revenue could decline and our business could suffer.\nWe recognize subscription listing revenue ratably over the term of the applicable listing agreement, and the majority of our quarterly revenue represents revenue attributable to listings entered into during previous quarters. As a result, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed subscription listings in a particular quarter will\nnot be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our business model also makes it difficult for any rapid increase in new or renewed listings to increase our revenue in any one period because revenue from new and renewed subscription listings must be recognized over the applicable listing term.\nMoreover, some of our property owners and managers may live in states or countries that give subscribers the right to cancel their subscriptions prior to expiration and receive refunds for the unused portions of their subscriptions. Termination of subscriptions in this manner may adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur quarterly financial results and key operating metrics are subject to fluctuations. As a result, we could fail to meet our projections or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue, expenses, operating results and cash flows, as well as our key operating metrics, have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future. These fluctuations are due to, or may result from, many factors, some of which are outside of our control and many of which are difficult to predict. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe quantity of vacation rental listings on our websites;\n\u2022\nadvertising costs for paid search keywords and other online or broad reach advertising and marketing initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of financing activities, operating expenses and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nchanges in cash flow due to the seasonal nature of our listing renewals and new listing acquisition;\n\u2022\nchanges in cash flow due to customers purchasing commission-based listings, the timing and quantity of which are difficult to predict;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue due to the irregular timing of commissions earned on our performance-based listings;\n\u2022\neconomic instability abroad and fluctuations in exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges by major online search engine companies in their search algorithms, which could increase expenses related to marketing and search engine optimization, or could cause our websites\u2019 positions in search results to suffer;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue and expenses related to the licensing, development, acquisition and integration of technologies, products, services or businesses, including expenses for such strategic business acquisitions which may not be finally completed;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of changes in our pricing or services;\n\u2022\nthe introduction and performance of new products or services;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or services by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of or increases in fraud impacting our property owners and managers and travelers, including theft of online identities through phishing or other system security breaches;\n\u2022\ndeclines or disruptions in the travel industry, particularly in regions where we generate substantial revenue;\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing of holidays or other vacation events;\n\u2022\nlitigation and settlement costs, including unforeseen attorneys\u2019 fees and costs;\n\u2022\nnew accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting standards or practices, particularly any affecting the recognition of listing revenue or accounting for mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, that harm our business models or restrict the vacation rental industry, the Internet, e-commerce, online payments, or online communications.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results may, particularly if unforeseen, cause us to miss any projections we may have provided or may lead analysts or investors to change their valuation of our stock. In addition, such fluctuations may cause us to face short-term liquidity issues, impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues. Any of these effects could cause our stock price to decline. As a result of the potential variability in our quarterly revenue and operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nIf we are unable to continue to drive visitors to our websites from search engines, then traffic to our websites could decrease, which could negatively impact transactions on our websites and therefore cause our revenue to decrease.\nMany visitors find our websites by searching for vacation rental information through Internet search engines. A critical factor in attracting visitors to our websites is how prominently we are displayed in response to search queries. Accordingly, we utilize search engine marketing, or SEM, as a means to provide a significant portion of our visitor acquisition. SEM includes both paid visitor acquisition (on a cost-per-click basis) and unpaid visitor acquisition, which is often referred to as organic search.\nOne method we employ to acquire visitors via organic search is commonly known as search engine optimization, or SEO. SEO involves developing our websites in order to rank highly in relevant search queries. In addition to SEM and SEO, we may also utilize other forms of marketing to drive visitors to our websites, including branded search, display advertising and email marketing.\nThe various search engine providers, such as Google and Bing, employ proprietary algorithms and other methods for determining which websites are displayed for a given search query and how highly websites rank. Search engine providers may change these methods in a way that may negatively affect the number of visitors to our websites and may do so without public announcement or detailed explanation. Therefore, the success of our SEO and SEM strategy depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner.\nIn addition, websites must comply with search engine guidelines and policies. These guidelines and policies are complex and may change at any time. If we fail to follow such guidelines and policies properly, the search engine may cause our content to rank lower in search results or could remove the content altogether. If we fail to understand and comply with these guidelines and policies and ensure our websites\u2019 compliance, our SEO and SEM strategy may not be successful.\nIf we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search result listings for any reason, including as a result of our failure to successfully execute our SEO and SEM strategy, it is likely that we will acquire fewer visitors to our websites. Fewer visitors to our websites could lead to property owners and managers becoming dissatisfied with our websites, as well as fewer travelers inquiring and booking through our websites, either or both of which could adversely impact our revenue. We may not be able to replace this traffic in a cost-effective manner from other channels, such as cost-per-click SEM or display or other advertising, or even at all. Any attempt to replace this traffic through other channels may increase our sales and marketing expenditures, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nUnfavorable changes in, or interpretations of, government regulations or taxation of the evolving vacation rental, Internet and e-commerce industries could harm our operating results.\nWe operate in markets throughout the world, in jurisdictions which have various regulatory and taxation requirements that can affect our operations or regulate the rental activity of property owners and managers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing different standards and requirements is very burdensome because each region in which we operate has different regulations with respect to licensing and other requirements for the listing of vacation rentals. Our online marketplace is accessed by property owners, managers and travelers in multiple states and foreign jurisdictions. Our business efficiencies and economies of scale depend on generally uniform treatment of property owners, managers and travelers across all jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance requirements that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction impose an added cost to our business and increased liability for compliance deficiencies. In addition, laws or regulations that may harm our business could be adopted, or reinterpreted in a manner that affects our activities, including but not limited to the regulation of personal and consumer information and real estate licensing requirements. Violations or new interpretations of these laws or regulations may result in penalties, negatively impact our operations and damage our reputation and business.\nIn addition, since we began our operations in 2005, there have been, and continue to be, regulatory developments that affect the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like us to list those vacation rentals online. For example, some municipalities have adopted ordinances that limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days and other cities may introduce similar regulations. Some cities also have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, which they assert apply to vacation rentals. Many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term vacation rentals. In addition, many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which creates a risk of these laws being used in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business. These and other similar new and newly interpreted regulations could increase costs for, or otherwise discourage, owners and managers from listing on our websites, which could harm our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in challenges to, or disputes with government agencies regarding, these regulations. For example, some government agencies have asked us directly to comply with their regulations and provide owner and manager data to assist them in their enforcement and audit efforts. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against the application of these laws and regulations. Further, if we were required to comply with regulations and government requests that negatively impact our relations with property owners, managers and travelers, our business, operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, new, changed, or newly interpreted or applied tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could increase our property owners\u2019 and managers\u2019 and our compliance, operating and other costs. This, in turn, could deter property owners and managers from renting their vacation properties, negatively affect our new listings and subscription renewals, or increase costs of doing business. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nFurthermore, as we expand or change the products and services that we offer or the methods by which we offer them, we may become subject to additional legal regulations, tax requirements or other risks. Regulators may seek to impose regulations and requirements on us even if we utilize third parties to offer the products or services. These regulations and requirements may apply to payment processing, insurance products or the various other products and services we may now or in the future offer or facilitate through our marketplace. Whether we comply with or challenge these additional regulations, our costs may increase and our business may otherwise be harmed.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our HomeAway brand and the brands associated with each of our websites, our reputation and business may suffer.\nIt is critical for us to maintain and enhance our brand identity in order to attract and retain property owners, managers and travelers. The successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on our marketing and public relations efforts. We expect that the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial investments, and,\nas our market becomes more competitive, these branding initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. In addition, we may not be able to successfully build our HomeAway brand identity in the United States and overseas without losing value associated with, or decreasing the effectiveness of, our other brand identities. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brands, we could lose traveler traffic, which could, in turn, cause property owners and managers to terminate or elect not to renew their listings with us. In addition, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or may not yield revenue sufficient to offset their cost, which could adversely affect our reputation and business.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our property owner, manager and traveler bases outside of the United States and, as a result, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have acquired businesses or established offices around the world. As of December 31, 2014, we maintain offices in the United States, Europe, South America, Australia and Asia and operate websites in several additional countries and regions. We have limited operating and e-commerce experience in many foreign jurisdictions and are making significant investments to build our international operations. We plan to continue our efforts to expand globally, including acquiring international businesses and conducting business in jurisdictions where we do not currently operate, including increasing our focus on the Asia Pacific region. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive and any international expansion efforts that we undertake may not be profitable in the near or long term or otherwise be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we generally do not face in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022\nthe cost and resources required to localize our services, which requires the translation of our websites and their adaptation for local practices and legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nadjusting the products and services we provide in foreign jurisdictions, as needed, to better address both the needs of local owners and travelers, and the threats of local competitors;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to foreign laws and regulations, including those laws governing Internet activities, email messaging, collection and use of personal information, ownership of intellectual property, taxation and other activities important to our online business practices, which may be less developed, less predictable, more restrictive, and less familiar, and which may adversely affect financial results in certain regions;\n\u2022\ncompetition with companies that understand the local market better than we do or who have pre-existing relationships with property owners, managers and travelers in those markets;\n\u2022\nlegal uncertainty regarding our liability for the transactions and content on our websites, including online bookings, property listings and other content provided by property owners and managers, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a lack of clear precedent of applicable law;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with and the burden of complying with a wide variety of other foreign laws, legal standards and foreign regulatory requirements, including invoicing, data collection and storage, financial reporting and tax compliance requirements, which are subject to unexpected changes;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with joint venture relationships and minority investments;\n\u2022\nadapting to variations in foreign payment forms;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and establishing or maintaining operational efficiencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls and security over our data and systems;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, which may be difficult to predict, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities and difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022\nthe potential failure of financial institutions internationally;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\nhigher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot guarantee that our international expansion efforts in any or multiple territories will be successful. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability and could instead result in increased costs.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.\nThe market to provide listing, search and marketing services for the vacation rental industry is very competitive and highly fragmented. In addition, the barriers to entry are low and new competitors may enter. All of the services that we provide to property owners, managers and travelers, including listing and search, are provided separately or in combination by current or potential competitors. Our competitors may adopt aspects of our business model, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services. Additionally, current or new competitors may introduce new business models or services that we may need to adopt or otherwise adapt to in order to compete, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our business or services from those of our competitors. Furthermore, properties in the vacation rental industry are not typically marketed exclusively through any single channel, and our listing agreements are not typically exclusive. Accordingly, our competitors could aggregate a set of listings similar to ours. Increased competition could result in a reduction in revenue, rate of new listing acquisition, existing listings or market share.\nThere are thousands of vacation rental listing websites that compete directly with us for listings, travelers, or both, such as HouseTrips.com, Booking.com, Airbnb, @Leisure, InterHome, TripAdvisor and Wyndham Worldwide. Many of these competitors offer free or heavily discounted listings or focus on a particular geographic location or a specific type of rental property. Some of them also aggregate property listings obtained through various sources, including the websites of property managers some of whom also market their properties on our websites.\nCompetitors also operate websites directed at the wider fragmented travel lodging market, such as Airbnb (worldwide) and Wimdu (worldwide), by listing either rooms or the owner\u2019s primary home. These properties increase both the number of rental opportunities available to travelers and the competition for the attention of the traveler. Some vacation rental property owners and managers also list on these websites, and consequently these companies currently compete with us to some extent.\nWe also compete with online travel agency websites, such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Kayak, Priceline, Booking.com, Orbitz and Travelocity, which have traditionally provided comprehensive travel services and some of whom are now expanding into the vacation rental category. We also compete with large Internet search companies, such as craigslist, eBay, Google, MSN.com and Yahoo!, which provide listing or advertising services in addition to a wide variety of other products or services. In addition, some competitors, such as Perfect Places, Inc. and VacationRoost, Inc. in the United States and Atraveo and eDomizil in Europe, predominately serve the\nprofessional property manager marketplace, and therefore have the ability to create more products and features targeted to property managers. Hotels, corporate travel providers, travel metasearch engines, travel content aggregators, mobile platform travel applications, social media websites, and even mobile computing hardware providers all also have the potential to increase their competitive presence in the areas of our business as well.\nWe believe we compete primarily on the basis of the quantity and quality of our listings, the quality of the direct relationships we have with property owners and managers, the volume of travelers who visit our websites, the number of inquiries provided to our property owners and managers, the global diversity of the vacation rentals available on our websites, the quality of our websites, the tools provided to our property owners and managers to assist them with their business, customer service, brand identity, the success of our marketing programs, and price. If current or potential property owners, managers or travelers choose to use any of these competitive offerings in lieu of ours, our revenue could decrease and we could be required to make additional expenditures to compete more effectively. Any of these events or results could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our current or potential competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition in their markets, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, our current or potential competitors may have access to larger property owner, manager or traveler bases. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or owner, manager or traveler requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, existing and potential owners, managers and travelers might accept our competitors\u2019 offerings, even if they may be inferior to ours. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nIf the businesses we have acquired or invested in do not perform as expected or we are unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have acquired 22 businesses and currently have equity investments in two companies. The businesses we have acquired or invested in may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate recently acquired businesses and technologies could harm our operating results and our prospects. If the companies we have invested in do not perform well, our investments could become impaired and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technologies, technology platforms and products of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u2022\nlegal or regulatory challenges or post-acquisition litigation, which could result in significant costs or require changes to the businesses or unwinding of the transaction;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flow;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the key customers and business relationships, and the reputations of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nuncertainty resulting from entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nour dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions;\n\u2022\nliabilities of acquired businesses, which may not be disclosed to us or which may exceed our estimates, including liabilities relating to non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as data protection and privacy controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assigning or transferring to us or our subsidiaries intellectual property licensed to companies we acquired;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining our internal standards, controls, procedures and policies including financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and extending these controls to acquired companies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with antitrust and other government regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\n\u2022\npotential accounting charges to the extent intangibles recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value.\nMoreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property, existence of open source software and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. If any of these representations and warranties are inaccurate or breached, such inaccuracy or breach could result in costly litigation and assessment of liability for which there may not be adequate recourse against such sellers, in part due to contractual time limitations and limitations of liability.\nIf we are unable to introduce new or upgraded products, services or features that travelers or property owners and managers recognize as valuable, we may fail to drive additional travelers to our websites or retain existing and attract new property owners and managers. Our efforts to develop new and upgraded services and products could require us to incur significant costs.\nIn order to continue to attract travelers to our online marketplace and retain existing and attract new property owners and managers, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, services and features that both add value for travelers, property owners and managers and differentiate us from our competitors. The success of new products, services and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the product, service or feature. If travelers, property owners or managers do not recognize the value of our new services or features, they may choose not to utilize or list on our online marketplace.\nAttempting to develop and deliver these new or upgraded products, services or features involves inherent hazards and difficulties, and is costly. Efforts to enhance and improve the ease of use, responsiveness, functionality and features of our existing websites have inherent risks, and we may not be able to manage these product developments and enhancements successfully. We cannot assure that we will succeed or that new or upgraded products, services or features will work as intended or provide value. In addition, some new or upgraded products, services or features may be difficult for us to market and may also involve unfavorable pricing. Even if we succeed, we cannot guarantee that our property owners and managers will respond favorably.\nIn addition to developing our own improvements, we may choose to license or otherwise integrate applications, content and data from third parties. The introduction of these improvements imposes costs on us and creates a risk that we may be unable to continue to access these technologies and content on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our growth.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth. As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 87 employees at December 31, 2005 to 1,780 employees at December 31, 2014, of whom 720 were located outside the United States. This includes employees of entities for which we have a controlling interest. Our business is becoming increasingly complex, especially in light of the continued rapid evolution of our industry and e-commerce, and our reliance on multiple websites throughout the world. This complexity and our rapid growth have demanded, and will continue to demand, substantial resources and attention from our management. We expect to continue to increase headcount and to hire more specialized personnel in the future as we grow our business. We will need to continue to hire, train and manage additional qualified website developers, software engineers, client and account services personnel, and sales and marketing staff and improve and maintain our technology to properly manage our growth. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed.\nFurther, to accommodate our expected growth we must add new hardware and software and improve and maintain our technology, systems and network infrastructure. Failure to effectively upgrade our technology or network infrastructure to support the expected increased listing and traveler traffic volume could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times or poor experiences for property owners, managers or travelers. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel and to continue to support our public company financial reporting and internal control requirements, we will need to continue to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. These improvements will be particularly challenging if we acquire new operations with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, it could adversely affect property owner, manager, traveler or advertiser satisfaction and revenue and operating income as a result.\nWe have a relatively limited operating history and we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, which make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. If we fail to predict the manner in which our business will perform or how the market will develop, our business and prospects may suffer materially.\nWe began our operations in February 2005. Our relatively limited operating history, together with our rapidly changing industry, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. These include challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting as we develop new products or strategic plans, such as our online booking initiative and value added services like insurance and property damage protection and payment processing capabilities, with little or no historical reference as a basis for such planning and forecasting. Our business and prospects should be considered in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter as a company operating in a highly competitive environment where changes to our business, plans, and products may be required to respond to such changes.\nIn addition, the market for online vacation rentals is relatively new and, in many geographies, is unproven with little data or research available regarding the market and industry. It is uncertain whether the vacation rental market in many territories where we do business will continue to develop or if our services will achieve and sustain a level of demand and market acceptance sufficient for us to generate revenue, net income and cash flow growth, at anticipated levels or at all. Even in territories where we currently do business, we may need to focus on or offer different types of products and services in order to remain competitive. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of property owners and managers to use commercial online rental property listing services. Some property managers have developed and use their own proprietary online listing services and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to use our websites to market their properties. Furthermore, some travelers and property owners and managers may be reluctant or unwilling to use online listing services because of concerns regarding the security of data, the potential for fraudulent activity, including phishing, or the\nintegrity of the online marketplace. If property owners and managers do not perceive the benefits of marketing their properties online, then our market may not develop as we expect, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which could significantly harm our business and operating results. Moreover, our success will depend on travelers\u2019 use of our online marketplace to search, locate and rent vacation rentals, which will depend on their willingness to use the Internet and their belief in the integrity of our websites. In addition, since we operate in unproven and unstudied markets, we have limited insight into trends that may develop in those markets and may affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to other relevant business trends, which could harm our business.\nChanges in our effective tax rate could harm our future operating results.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several circumstances, including:\n\u2022\nearnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;\n\u2022\neffects of certain non-tax deductible expenses, including those arising from the requirement to expense stock options;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022\ntransfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement and legal structure;\n\u2022\nadverse outcomes resulting from any tax audit;\n\u2022\nour ability to utilize our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in tax laws and regulations, or the application of the tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.\nSignificant judgment is required in the application of accounting guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes. If tax authorities challenge our tax positions and any such challenges are settled unfavorably, it could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nBecause we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. In addition, fluctuation in our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions may contribute to this effect as exchange rates vary. Moreover, as a result of these exchange rate fluctuations, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results may differ materially from expectations when translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. For example, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies our non-U.S. revenue would be adversely affected when translated into U.S. dollars. Conversely, a decline in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenue when translated into U.S. dollars. Revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $0.5 million, while revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $1.7 million. In addition, we maintain intercompany loans and payables which are subject to translation losses due to foreign exchange fluctuation. We may enter into hedging arrangements in order to manage foreign currency exposure but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting capable management and operating personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, as well as skilled technical and marketing personnel, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry, and the loss of even a few qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program and incentive bonuses for executive officers and other key employees. However, some employees have been granted stock options with an exercise price that is or may become less than the market price, which reduces the incentive value of these grants. While we attempt to provide additional or different incentive compensation tools to mitigate this impact, the measures we employ to attract and maintain key personnel may not be effective enough to enable us to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively.\nIf we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches, or if property owners, managers or travelers are reluctant to use our online marketplace because of privacy or security concerns, we might face additional costs, and activity on our websites could decline.\nWe collect and use personally identifiable information of property owners, managers and travelers in the operation of our business. Our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Anyone that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches of our systems, or even the systems of third parties we rely upon, such as credit card processors, could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation and possible liability under various laws and regulations. In addition, industry-wide incidents, or incidents specific to us, could deter people from using our online marketplace. Concern among property owners, managers and travelers regarding our use of personal information collected on our websites could keep them from using, or continuing to use, our online marketplace.\nThere are risks of security breaches both on and off our systems as we increase the types of technology we use to operate our marketplace, such as mobile applications. New and evolving technology systems and platforms may involve security risks that are difficult to predict and adequately guard against. In addition, third parties that process credit card transactions between us and property owners and managers maintain personal information collected from them. Such information could be stolen or misappropriated, and we could be subject to liability as a result. Further, property owners and managers may develop a lack of confidence in these third parties or in their ability to securely conduct credit card transactions on our websites or the Internet in general, which could adversely impact our business, revenue and operating results. Our property owners, managers and travelers may be harmed by such breaches and we may in turn be subject to costly litigation or regulatory compliance costs, and harm to our reputation and brand. Moreover, some property owners, managers and travelers may cease using our marketplace altogether.\nThe laws of some states and countries require businesses that maintain personal information about their residents in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure. Our practice is to encrypt all sensitive information, but we do not know whether our current practice will be challenged under these laws. In addition, under certain of these laws, if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal data has been stolen, we are required to inform any user whose data was stolen, which could harm our reputation and business. Complying with the applicable notice requirements in the event of a security breach could result in significant costs. We may also be subject to contractual claims, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities, and claims by persons whose information was disclosed.\nCompounding these legal risks, many states and countries have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with these\nnumerous and contradictory requirements of is particularly difficult for us because we collect personal information from users in multiple jurisdictions. While we intend to comply fully with these laws, failure to comply could result in legal liability, cause us to suffer adverse publicity and lose business, traffic and revenue. If we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these or similar laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, third parties may target users of our websites directly with attempts to breach the security of their email accounts or management systems, such as through phishing attacks, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate emails from us or from our property owners and managers. Criminals may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our property owners, managers or travelers in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Although phishing attacks and other fraud schemes are generally not carried out through our systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. As a result, we may be required to defend ourselves in costly litigation and may suffer harm to our reputation, brand and business.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changes in technology, our business could be harmed.\nBecause property owners, managers and travelers can access our websites using a variety hardware and software platforms, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with related technological changes. We may not be successful in developing necessary, functional and popular modifications and enhancements. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of these necessary changes could result in unplanned research and development expenses. In addition, any failure of our online marketplace to operate effectively with future technologies could result in dissatisfaction from travelers, property owners, managers and advertisers, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to liability for the activities of our property owners and managers, which could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs.\nWe periodically receive complaints related to certain activities on our websites, including disputes over the authenticity of a vacation rental listing, unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft, phishing attacks, potential breaches of system security, libel, and infringement of third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. We have also experienced fraud by purported owners or managers listing properties which either do not exist or are significantly not as described in the listing. The methods used by perpetrators of fraud constantly evolve and are complex. Moreover, our trust and security measures may not detect all fraudulent activity. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive complaints from travelers and requests for reimbursement of their rental fees, as well as actual or threatened related legal action against us.\nWe may also be subject to claims of liability based on events that occur during travelers\u2019 stays at vacation rentals, including those related to robbery, injury, death, and other similar incidents. As our websites become more integral to the rental transaction through our expanded e-commerce tools and offerings, the potential for these types of claims could increase. This in turn could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business and results of operations, even if these claims do not result in liability, as we incur costs related to investigation and defense. The available terms and conditions of our websites specifically state that we are exempt from any liability to travelers relating to these matters. However, the enforceability of these terms varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the laws in this area are consistently evolving. If we are subject to liability or claims of liability relating to the acts of our property owners or managers, or due to fraudulent listings, we may be subject to negative publicity, incur additional expenses and be subject to liability, any of which could harm our business and our operating results.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Credit card acceptance privileges involve additional potential costs relating to reimbursements and fraud.\nA significant percentage of our property owners and managers pay for their listings by credit card. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges could significantly limit the availability and desirability of our products and services. Moreover, if we fail to fully perform our contractual obligations we could be obligated to reimburse credit card companies for refunded payments that have been contested by the cardholders. In addition, even when we are in compliance with these obligations, we bear other expenses including those related to the acceptance of fraudulent credit cards. As a result of all of these risks, credit card companies may require us to set aside additional cash reserves, may increase the transaction fees they charge us, or may even refuse to renew our acceptance privileges.\nIn addition, credit card networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or the PCI DSS. Under these rules, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of card data. We assess our compliance with the PCI DSS rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls. Failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability and could prevent us from processing or accepting credit cards. However, we cannot guarantee that compliance with these rules will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments systems or the theft, loss or misuse of the credit card data.\nThe loss of, or the significant modification of, the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue, expenses and operating results could be affected by changes in travel, real estate and vacation rental markets, as well as general economic conditions.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to trends in the travel, real estate and vacation rental markets, which are unpredictable, as well as trends in the general economy. Therefore, our operating results, to the extent they reflect changes in the broader travel, real estate and vacation rental industries, may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nFor example, changes in the travel industry, such as disruptions caused by war, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, weather bankruptcies or diseases could significantly reduce the willingness of potential travelers to plan vacation and other travel. Such disruptions that harm or destroy vacation homes could cause the property owners and managers of such homes to cancel or fail to renew their listings. Downturns in real estate markets may result in decreased new building rates and increases in foreclosures, which could also result in fewer vacation rentals available for listing. Also, since vacation travel is generally dependent on discretionary spending, negative general economic conditions could significantly reduce the overall amount that travelers spend on vacation travel. Additionally, property owners may choose or be forced to sell their vacation rentals during periods of economic slowdown or recession. Any or all of these factors could reduce the demand for vacation rentals and our services, reducing our revenue. This in turn could increase our need to make significant expenditures to continue to attract property owners, managers and travelers to our websites.\nVacation rentals are often located in popular vacation destinations around the world and utilized on a seasonal basis. Factors influencing the desirability of vacation rentals in a particular region or season could adversely affect our ability to obtain new listings and retain existing listings.\nVacation rentals are often located in popular vacation destinations and utilized on a seasonal basis. As a result, our listings involve properties that are often concentrated in particular regions, and our revenue is dependent upon our ability or willingness to list properties in those regions. If we became unable or unwilling to list properties in a particular region, our listings in the region could decline or cease to grow, and revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, factors influencing the desirability of vacation rentals in a particular region or during a specific season could adversely affect our ability to obtain new listings and retain existing listings. A significant natural disaster, political turmoil or other regional disturbance could reduce the number of available vacation rentals in that area, reducing our listing base and our revenue. In addition, if we do not have sufficient property listings in a newly popular vacation destination, we could fail to attract travelers to our websites and property owners and managers may opt to list their properties with a competitor having a greater presence in that area.\nWe could face liability for transactions and information on or accessible through our online marketplace.\nA significant portion of the information available through our online marketplace is submitted by property owners and managers and third parties. We also allow third parties to advertise their products and services on our websites and include links to third-party websites. We could be exposed to liability with respect to this third-party information. Property owners and managers could assert that information concerning them on our websites contains errors or omissions and third parties could seek damages from us for losses incurred if they rely upon such incorrect information. We could also be subject to claims that such information is defamatory, libelous, or infringes on third-party copyrights and privacy and publicity rights. We might be subject to claims that by providing links to third party websites, we are liable for wrongful actions by those third parties. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims.\nIn addition, our services feature a property review platform, which allows travelers to post property reviews and other information about properties, property owners and managers. Although this feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of libel, defamation or other injury have been made against other Internet service providers offering similar forums and may be made against us for content posted in this forum. Our potential liability for this information could require us to expend substantial resources to reduce our liability exposure and may limit the attractiveness of our online marketplace. Moreover, our general liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nProperty owner, manager or traveler complaints or negative publicity about our company, our services or our business activities could diminish use of our online marketplace.\nProperty owner, manager or traveler complaints or negative publicity about our company, our services or our business activities could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our online marketplace. Our measures to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our property owners and managers, for instance when we remove listings which have repeatedly been reported as misleadingly described. These measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle property owner, manager and traveler complaints effectively. If we do not handle these complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer, and we may lose the confidence of property owners, managers and travelers. We may also be the subject of blog or forum postings that include inaccurate statements and create negative publicity. As a result of these complaints or negative publicity, property owners and managers may discontinue their listing with us or travelers may discontinue their use of our websites, and our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our ability to compete could be impaired.\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our websites, our registered domain names, our registered and unregistered trademarks and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our domain names and our technology infrastructure currently give us a competitive advantage in the online market for vacation rental listings. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand, reputation and perceived content value could be harmed, resulting in an impaired ability to compete effectively.\nTo protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, contractual provisions and our user policy and restrictions on disclosure. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we promptly take action we deem appropriate to protect our rights. We regularly deliver cease and desist letters to parties who misappropriate our trademarks or content, such as aggregators of vacation rental listing content who use automated technology to download content from our online marketplace and display it on their websites without our permission. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and, despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites without authorization. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our domain names, service marks and our other proprietary rights. Even if we do detect violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights, litigation may be necessary to enforce our rights, and any enforcement efforts we undertake could be time-consuming, expensive, distracting and result in unfavorable outcomes. A failure to protect our intellectual property in a cost-effective and meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 20 patent applications and no issued patents. Any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.\nWe may be subject to claims that we violated intellectual property rights of others, which are extremely costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to operate.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received and may continue to receive claims that we have violated other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding or business methods. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology, content, branding or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot license or develop technology, content, branding or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which could increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and be inferior. Any of these results could harm our operating results.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host and deliver a significant portion of our services, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for numerous products and services, including payment processing services, data center services, web hosting services, insurance products for customers and travelers and some customer service functions. We rely on these companies to provide uninterrupted services and to provide their services in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nWe use a combination of third-party data centers distributed globally across multiple regions to host our websites and core services. We do not control the operation of any of the third-party data center facilities we use. These facilities, including our co-location hosting center, may be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism and other misconduct. They are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and similar events. We currently do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place nor do our systems provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing. As a result, the occurrence of any of these events, a decision by our third-party service providers to close their data center facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in loss of data as well as a significant interruption in our services and harm to our reputation and brand. Additionally, our third-party data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our third-party data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provisioning of our services until an agreement with another data center facility can be arranged. This shift to alternate data centers could take more than 24 hours depending on the nature of the event.\nFurthermore, we depend on continuous and uninterrupted access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our bandwidth providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, we could experience disruption in our services or we could be required to retain the services of a replacement bandwidth provider, which could harm our business and reputation.\nOur operations are dependent on the availability of electricity, which also comes from third-party providers. If we or the third-party data center facilities that we use to deliver our services were to experience a major power outage, it could result in disruption of our services and harm to our business.\nIf these companies experience difficulties and are not able to provide services in a reliable and secure manner, if they do not operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and, with respect to payment and card processing companies, if they are unable to effectively combat the use of fraudulent payments on our websites, our results of operations and financial positions could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if such third-party service providers were to cease operations or face other business disruption either temporarily or permanently, or otherwise face serious performance problems, we could suffer increased costs and delays until we found or developed an equivalent replacement, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nIf we do not successfully implement any acquisition strategies, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe face competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies and assets, and, in the future, such competition may become more intense. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition that we would like to consummate, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms or at all because of such competition. Furthermore, if we enter into negotiations that are not ultimately consummated, those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. Even if we are able to complete such acquisitions, we may additionally expend significant amounts of cash or incur substantial debt to finance them, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and use of available cash. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in dilution of our existing stockholders. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to realize their benefits. If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nWe rely on assumptions and estimates and data from third parties to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nCertain key metrics, such as number of unique visitors, total traffic and number of listings, reviews and opinions, are calculated, in some cases, using internal company data and, in other cases, relying on data from third parties. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable periods of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and user engagement across our large user base around the world. Accordingly, the calculations of our unique visitors may not accurately reflect the number of people actually using our platforms. In addition, our measures of growth may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similar metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodologies utilized by us and the third parties on which we rely for this data.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to estimate these key metrics. We regularly review and adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy. If our users, advertisers, partners and stockholders do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics, our reputation may be harmed. This in turn could cause property owners, managers, travelers and advertisers not to use our products and services which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur culture emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes property owner, manager, and traveler experience over short-term financial results.\nWe have a culture that encourages rapid development and release of new and improved products, and generally prioritizes property owner, manager, and traveler experience over short-term financial results. We have taken actions in the past and may continue to make product or other decisions going forward that have the effect of reducing our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit long term-revenue and profitability through improved property owner, manager, and traveler experience and/or conversion rates and pricing. The short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than we anticipate. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, website experience, relationships with property owners, managers, and travelers and advertisers, and business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our financial position and lower our stock price.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley. These provisions require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing our assessments. We also operate in a complex environment and expect these obligations, together with our rapid growth and expansion through acquisitions, to place significant demands on our management and administrative resources, including accounting and tax resources. Although we have expanded the size and depth of the finance and accounting staff in our U.S. and European headquarters, we may need to hire additional personnel. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management\u2019s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on our management\u2019s assessment or on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products or services or enhance our existing products or services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and\ntechnologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe have significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the aggregate face value of our outstanding convertible senior promissory notes was $402.5 million. Risks relating to our indebtedness include:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\npossibly placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\napplying the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, which requires the notes\u2019 equity component to be included in the paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity and the value of the equity component to be treated as a debt discount. The amortization of this discount will result in lower reported net income which in turn could adversely affect our reported financial results;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that we finds acceptable; and\n\u2022\nresponding to the conditional conversion feature of the notes, which if triggered could adversely affect our liquidity if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation through the payment of cash.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results of similar companies and competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in our outlook for future operating results which are communicated to investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarketing and advertising initiatives by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of listings;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in our management;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry, the travel industry and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe reports of industry research analysts who cover our competitors and us;\n\u2022\nstock-based compensation expense under applicable accounting standards; and\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of our common stock.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could materially harm our business.\nIf securities analysts and other industry experts do not continue to publish research or publish negative research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research, reports and other media that securities analysts and other industry experts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes negative research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the stock market and demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more industry analysts publish negative statements about our business, our stock price could decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stockholders could receive a return on their investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when they sell their shares.\nOur charter documents, Delaware law, and the indenture governing our outstanding convertible senior promissory notes could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also depress the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\ncreating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nSimilarly, the indenture governing our outstanding convertible promissory notes includes provisions that:\n\u2022\nprohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the promissory notes; and\n\u2022\nmay require us under certain circumstances to repurchase all or a portion of these promissory notes, and in some cases repurchase the promissory notes subject to an additional make whole adjustment.\nCertain provisions under Delaware law, the provisions listed above, and other provisions included in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 12882, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AWAY.1"}
