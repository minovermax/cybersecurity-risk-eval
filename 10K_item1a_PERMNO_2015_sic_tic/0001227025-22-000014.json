RISK FACTORS\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER\nOur proposed Merger may be delayed or not occur at all for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside of the parties' control, and if these conditions are not satisfied, the Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may not be completed.\nOn November 3, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement, with Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Neptune Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Lumentum Holdings. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of the Neptune Merger Sub with and into us, which we refer to as the \u201cMerger\u201d, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lumentum. Completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) obtaining Chinese antitrust approvals (ii) the absence of governmental injunctions or other legal restraints prohibiting the Merger or imposing certain antitrust restraints and (iii) the absence of a \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect,\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain materiality exceptions), and material compliance by the other party with its covenants under the Merger Agreement. Therefore, the Merger may not be completed or may not be completed as quickly as expected.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed by August 3, 2022, either we or Lumentum may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement (subject to two automatic extensions if the closing is delayed due to certain conditions to closing relating to antitrust laws not being satisfied but all other conditions to the closing are otherwise satisfied or could be satisfied at the closing). Either party may also elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, including by mutual written consent of both parties.\nFailure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated;\n\u2022If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $27,500,000;\n\u2022We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses for professional services in connection with the Merger for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not consummated; and\n\u2022A failed Merger may result in negative publicity and/or give a negative impression of us in the investment community, with our suppliers, and with our customers.\nEfforts to complete the Merger could disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, divert management\u2019s attention, or result in negative publicity or legal proceedings, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business.\nWe have expended, and continue to expend, significant management time and resources in an effort to complete the Merger, which may have a negative impact on our ongoing business. Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Merger and our future could disrupt our business relationships with our existing and potential customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords and other business partners, who may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Merger could also adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key personnel and other employees. The pendency of the Merger may also result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the financial markets, and it has led to, and may result in additional, litigation against us and our directors and officers. Such litigation is distracting to management and, may, in the future, require us to incur significant costs. Such litigation could result in the Merger being delayed and/or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which could prevent the Merger from becoming effective. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger which could discourage a potential competing acquiror from making an alternative transaction proposal.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that preclude our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and require us to refrain from authorizing or knowingly permitting our representatives from soliciting alternative transactions, which likely would discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner from making an alternative transaction proposal that we could not accept in light of the approval of the Merger by our stockholders.\nAdditionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities and must generally operate our business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger. Although we may be able to pursue such activities with the Lumentum\u2019s consent, Lumentum may not be willing to provide its consent for us to do so.\nIf the Merger occurs, our stockholders will not be able to participate in any further upside to our business.\nIf the Merger is consummated, our stockholders will receive $16.00 in cash per share, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, of our common stock owned by them, and will not receive any shares of Lumentum\u2019s common stock. As a result, if our business following the Merger performs well, our current stockholders will not receive any additional consideration and will therefore not receive any benefit from any such future performance of our business.\nLitigation could delay and or prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nWe and our directors were named as defendants in several lawsuits brought by purported stockholders challenging the Merger and seeking various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as awards of damages, costs, expert fees and attorneys\u2019 fees. While the plaintiffs in these lawsuits have dismissed their claims, we may be subject to additional future litigation challenging the Merger. One of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is that no injunction by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction, such as a court, will be in effect that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. As such, if any future legal actions result in an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe, either of which could substantially harm our business.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nWe are dependent on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders in any period from any of these major customers may reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe telecommunications systems market is concentrated with approximately ten global network equipment manufacturing companies having collectively more than 90% market share. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Our top five customers accounted for 75%, 79%, and 84% of our revenue in the in the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. Four customers were greater than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and three customers were greater than 10% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe lack of significant growth from, the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from any of our major customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In 2021, the reduction in revenue from Huawei, our largest customer in 2020, due to Department of Commerce export restrictions had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in 2021. Our sales to Huawei are expected to remain adversely impacted.\nSupply constraints and manufacturing problems could impact manufacturing yields or result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue, competitive position, and reputation.\nOur products contain purchased components including electronic components and semiconductors. Due to the global shortages in the supply of semiconductors, we have experienced delays and disruptions in our manufacturing operations as well as increased costs to ensure supply. These delays and disruptions have adversely impacted component manufacturing volumes and have resulted in delays in our product shipments. As a result, product shipments to our customers have been delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers, which has negatively affected our revenue and margins. Until the global shortages in the supply of semiconductors is resolved, our manufacturing volumes and shipment dates to customers and product costs may continue to be adversely impacted. Continued shortages in the supply of semiconductors and other electronic components may also cause us to experience quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, could negatively affect our competitive position and reputation, and we may be unable to meet our growth and revenue targets due to an inability to purchase sufficient components for our products to satisfy customer demand.\nAdditionally, manufacturing of new products and manufacturing yields generally depend on a number of factors, including the stability and manufacturability of the product design, manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes, the quality and consistency of component parts and the nature and extent of customization requirements by customers. Capacity constraints, raw materials shortages, logistics issues, labor shortages, volatility in utilization of manufacturing operations, supporting utility services and other manufacturing supplies, the introduction of new product lines, rapid increases in production demands and changes in customer requirements, manufacturing facilities or processes, or those of some third party contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have caused, and may in the future cause, reduced manufacturing yields, negatively impacting the gross margin on, and our production capacity for, those products.\nOur ability to maintain sufficient manufacturing yields is particularly challenging with respect to PICs due to the complexity and required precision of a large number of unique manufacturing process steps. Manufacturing yields for PICs can also suffer if contaminated materials or materials that do not meet highly precise composition requirements are inadvertently utilized. Because a large portion of our PIC manufacturing costs are fixed, PIC manufacturing yields can have a substantial effect on our gross margin. Lower than expected manufacturing yields could also delay product shipments and decrease our revenue.\nAdditionally, it is possible that purchased components could contain quality defects, manufacturing defects, performance problems or even counterfeit substitutes, each of which could result in manufacturing issues. As a result, we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross margin, and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation.\nOur solutions for the Cloud and data center market segments may not achieve broader market acceptance, which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share.\nPart of our overall strategy is to continue to expand our optoelectronic solutions for the highest speed Cloud and data center market segments. If we fail to achieve broader acceptance of our products in the Cloud and data center markets, there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue, gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability. Our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors, but not limited to:\n\u2022Our ability to produce optoelectronic solutions for 100G to 800G and beyond that compete favorably against other solutions on the basis of price, quality, reliability and performance;\n\u2022Our ability to timely introduce and complete new designs and timely qualify and certify our products;\n\u2022Whether major Cloud and hyperscale data center operators will adopt our solutions, which are based on a new network architecture and have a limited history in these market segments;\n\u2022Our ability to develop products that comply with applicable standards and regulatory requirements, as well as potential in-country manufacturing requirements; and;\n\u2022Our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with our customers and suppliers, many of whom are large companies with substantial negotiating power.\n\u2022If the Cloud and data center market segments delay their deployments or fail to grow as expected, or if demand for our solutions in these segments fails to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will suffer.\nIf our key customers do not qualify our products for use or do not award us design wins, then our results of operations may suffer.\nPrior to placing volume purchase orders with us, most of our customers require us to obtain their approval, a process called qualification in our industry, for our new and existing products. Our customers often audit our manufacturing facilities and perform other vendor evaluations during this process. The qualification process involves product sampling and reliability testing and collaboration with our product management and engineering teams in the design and manufacturing stages. If we are unable to qualify our products with customers, then our revenue would be lower than expected and we may not be able to recover the costs associated with the qualification process which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, due to evolving technological changes in our markets, a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we have qualified our product or begun volume manufacturing of a qualified product. It is unlikely that we would be able to recover the expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects.\nOnce we have achieved qualification, there is no guarantee that our customers will purchase our products in volume. Our customers typically select two to three vendors per design or version of their products and award a design win. If we are not awarded a design win, our customer will not place volume purchase orders for that version of the customer product.\nWe face intense competition which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share.\nThe communications networks industry is highly competitive. Our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in niche products.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater name brand recognition, technical, financial, and marketing resources, and greater manufacturing capacity, as well as better-established relationships with customers, than we do. Some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire, and more experience in developing or acquiring, new products and technologies. Some of our competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us, may be able to develop products that are more reliable or which provide more functionality than ours, and may be able to ramp production faster than we can. In addition, some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below-market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively and result in a loss of sales or market share or cause us to lower prices for our products.\nWe also face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally. Due to the fact that such customers are not seeking to make a comparable profit directly from the manufacture of these products or for other reasons, they may have the ability to provide competitive products at a lower total cost than we would charge such customers. As a result, these customers may purchase less of our products and there would be additional pressure to lower our selling prices which, accordingly, would negatively impact our revenue and gross margin.\nCustomer demand is difficult to accurately forecast and, as a result, we may be unable to optimally match production with customer demand.\nWe make planning and spending decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers, and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products, reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. Additionally, due to global semiconductor and electronic component shortages, the purchase lead time for many have our components has increased substantially, in some cases to over a year. To ensure that we have sufficient components to build our products to meet expected customer demands, we have placed non-cancellable orders for these components. A sudden reduction in customer demand would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, as occurred in 2017, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed.\nOn the other hand, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate higher or more restrictive procurement commitments, increase our manufacturing yield loss and scrapping of excess materials, result in delayed shipments and/or reduce our gross margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, and we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing operations on a timely basis to meet increasing customer demand. Additionally, one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. Any inability to meet customer demands for rapid increases in production in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business could suffer.\nOur success and ability to implement our business strategy depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and others, including senior management in foreign subsidiaries and our technical and operations employees in all locations. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management and others. The loss of services of members of our senior management team or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Competition for highly skilled technical and operations people where we operate is extremely intense, and we continue to face challenges identifying, hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business. The anticipated merger has also created perceived uncertainty from current and prospective employees, which has placed additional strain on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe have had a history of losses, we returned to losses in the fourth quarter of 2021, and losses may recur in the future.\nWe have had a history of losses and we may incur additional losses in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was $459.6 million. Due to the global semiconductor shortage, shipments to our customers were delayed and as a result our revenue suffered in 2021. Our inability to purchase sufficient semiconductor components to meet customer demand for our products may result in additional losses in 2022.\nWe continue to review our expenditures related to the ongoing operations of our business for their effectiveness. We plan to make adjustments to our expenditures as needed. These include expenditures related to the sales, marketing and development of our products and to maintain our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations. Operations and assets that are deemed to be less effective have been and may in the future be subject to restructuring, which could lead to increased operating losses in future periods when and if restructuring charges are incurred.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import rules and regulations that could subject us to liability, impair our ability to compete in international markets, or restrict our sales to certain customers.\nWe are subject to export and import control laws, trade regulations and other rules that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. The United States, China, and various countries regulate the export or import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. Failure to comply with these and similar laws or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products or to obtain any required licenses would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) has added Huawei and certain of its affiliates and Fiberhome and certain of its affiliates to its Entity List. To comply with the restrictions and requirements of the Entity list, we have conducted multiple systematic assessments of our products to ensure compliance. The BIS restrictions impact our products, our manufacturing processes, our manufacturing equipment, and our components. Due to the complexity of such regulations, we sometimes have halted shipment to these customers while the assessments were underway, resulting in adverse revenue impact.\nAny additions to or changes in laws, rules, or regulations may result in our inability to ship products to customers, a reduction in the type or quantity of products we can ship, or our inability to use existing suppliers, resulting in negative impacts on our cost structure and results of operation. Various newly enacted and proposed laws and regulations, such as the proposed new regulations in the United States on Information and Communications Technology and Services (\u201cICTS\u201d) and the Export Control Law (\u201cECL\u201d) enacted in China, could result in new licensing requirements delays, restrictions, or prohibitions the import, export, or sale of our products to various countries or customers.\nAdditionally, even if we are legally able to sell the same types of products we have sold historically to affected customers, such customers may decide not to purchase these products for various reasons, including to reduce its own risks of being exposed to disruptions of its supply chain. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the various regulatory entities, including the U.S. government, will not challenge our determination of which products and associated technology are not subject to the applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nContinued tension in U.S.-China trade relations may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe U.S. government has taken certain other actions in the past several years that impact U.S.-China trade relations, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China. Some products manufactured by our Chinese affiliates are subject to tariffs if imported into the United States. In addition, the China government has taken certain reciprocal actions, including tariffs, which affect certain products manufactured in the United States. Certain of our products manufactured in our U.S. operations were included in the tariffs imposed on imports into China from the United States. As of March 2020, tariffs on most of the products we imported into China have been eliminated. However, there can be no assurance that China will not re-impose these or similar tariffs, impose export restrictions, or take other retaliatory trade actions that may have a material impact on our business.\nIt is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs or other new laws or regulations will be adopted that increase the cost of importing products to or from the United States, or from China to the United States. Further, it is unknown what effect that any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions would have on us or our industry and customers. As additional new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or other affected countries take retaliatory trade actions, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn response to trade tensions, the Chinese government and/or individual Chinese customers may take steps to reduce their supply chain dependence on products from U.S. suppliers through their own internal developments or the selection of non-U.S. suppliers, placing us at a commercial disadvantage and potentially affecting our business.\nOur future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Japanese Yen (JPY) exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks. Foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenue and our costs and expenses, and hence our results of operations. A substantial portion of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries based in China, whose functional currency is the RMB, and in Japan, whose functional currency is the JPY. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies and the value of the JPY against the U.S. dollar and other currencies fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions.\nWe depend upon outside contract manufacturers for a portion of the manufacturing process for some of our products. Our operations and revenue related to these products could be adversely affected if we encounter problems with any such contract manufacturer.\nWhile many of our products are manufactured internally, we also rely upon contract manufacturers in Thailand, China, Japan, other Asia locations, and Canada to provide back-end manufacturing and production of some of our products. Our reliance on contract manufacturers for some of our products makes us vulnerable to possible production capacity constraints, reduced control over their supply chains, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, manufacturing quality controls and costs. If one of our contract manufacturers is unable to meet all of our customer demand in a timely fashion, whether due to their direct operating control, due to their supply chain or due to the Covid-19 pandemic or other factors, this could have a material adverse effect on the revenue from our products.\nIncreasing inflation may negatively impact our business.\nInflation in the United States and worldwide may result in increased costs and additional shortages of supplies and components that are critical to the manufacturing of our products, may increase cost of borrowing through our lines of credit, and may reduce our purchasing power, all of which would have a negative impact on our results of operation.\nWe are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our gross margins.\nThe communications networks industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time as technological advances improve performance of new products and put pressure on existing products to reduce prices. We have reduced the prices of many of our products in the past, most often during annual end-of-year price negotiation. We expect pricing pressure for our products to continue. To maintain or increase their market share, our competitors also reduce prices of their products each year. In addition, our customers may seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge, which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices. If we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume, reducing our costs or introducing new products, our gross margin would be adversely affected.\nThe communications networks industry has long product development cycles requiring us to incur product development costs without assurances of an acceptable investment return.\nLarge volumes of communications equipment and support structures are installed with considerable expenditures of funds and other resources, and long investment return period expectations. At the component supplier level, these cycles create considerable, typically multi-year, gaps between the commencement of new product development and volume purchases. Due to changing industry and customer requirements, we are constantly developing new products, including seeking to further integrate functions on PICs and developing and using new technologies in our products. These development activities necessitate significant investment of capital. Our new products often require a long time to develop because of their complexity and rigorous testing and qualification requirements. Accordingly, we and our competitors often incur significant research and development and sales and marketing costs for products that, initially, will be purchased by our customers long after much of the cost is incurred and, in some cases, may never be purchased due to changes in industry or customer requirements in the interim.\nThe majority of our customer contracts do not commit customers to specified buying levels, and many of our customers may decrease, cancel or delay their buying levels at any time with little or no advance notice to us.\nOur products are typically sold pursuant to individual purchase orders or by use of a vendor-managed inventory (\"VMI\"), model, which is a process by which we ship agreed quantities of products to a customer-designated location and those products remain our inventory and we retain the title and risk of loss for those products until the customer takes possession of the products. Our customers are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place, which may impact our level of business.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner, customer and employee personal data. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2020, we discovered that we were affected by the Solar Winds Corporation cybersecurity breach; however our comprehensive review by an internal information security group and a third party cybersecurity investigator found no evidence of any suspicious activity on our networks or of any compromise to our data.\nDespite using updated security measures, our systems may continue to be vulnerable to cyber security attacks or breaches. While we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems, processes, procedures, and user training to mitigate these potential risks, there is no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to prevent future cyber-attacks. Because security incidents are often not detected immediately, we also may face difficulties or delays in identifying or responding to security breaches and security-related incidents. Additionally, if we discover a threat and take remediation efforts, there may be compromises to our data that our investigation did not uncover or additional undiscovered malware on our networks which could result in further breaches of data security or interruptions of our information technology systems.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has and could further harm our operations and our financial operations.\nOur operations and supply chain are and could continue to be impacted by the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our manufacturing operations in Silicon Valley, California; Tokyo, Japan; and Shenzhen and Dongguan, China have been affected and could continue to be affected with actions such as being temporarily shut down, requiring longer lead times or being subject to logistics issues. The same issues have affected and could continue to impact key suppliers in Patumthanee, Thailand, and Ottawa, Canada and other locations throughout United States and Asia. The efficiency of our business operations (including sales and research and development) could also be reduced as a result of compliance with shelter-in-place orders in Silicon Valley, California; Ottawa, Canada; and Shenzhen and Wuhan, China.\nSimilarly, our worldwide operations could be subject to secondary effects of the pandemic. Even if our facilities are not directly affected, the pandemic and its effects could substantially disrupt the business of our suppliers or customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAccordingly, we may experience significant disruptions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic that could materially impact our business, including:\n\u2022Slower customer deployments of systems using our products due to uncertainty in the business climate;\n\u2022Reduced demand for our products;\n\u2022Disruptions of the supply chain of components needed for our products; and\n\u2022Disruptions of our ability to conduct sales, marketing, product development and other important business activities.\nThe extent to which the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, governmental mandates issued to mitigate the spread of the disease, business closures, economic disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the virus. Accordingly, we expect the Covid-19 pandemic may have a\nnegative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which are difficult to predict. We are not insured against major public health events, including the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTo the extent the Covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section, such as reduced spending for communications networks, fluctuations in customer demand, manufacturing and supply constraints, and our ability to raise capital (if necessary).\nIf the Merger is not completed or is delayed substantially, we may need to raise additional capital in order to pursue our business strategies or maintain our operations, and we may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash flows from our operating activities and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we operate in an industry that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs and the Merger is not completed or is substantially delayed, we may need additional financing to continue operations or execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:\n\u2022Invest in our research and development efforts (particularly in the Cloud and data center interconnect market segments), including by hiring additional technical and other personnel;\n\u2022Maintain and expand our operating or manufacturing infrastructure (particularly for our Cloud and data center products);\n\u2022Acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies; or\n\u2022Otherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures.\nWe do not know with certainty what forms of financing, if any, will be available to us. If financing is not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions, develop and enhance our products, respond to unanticipated events, including unanticipated opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be adversely impacted.\nIf we incur additional indebtedness through arrangements such as credit agreements or term loans, such arrangements may impose restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to respond appropriately to market conditions, make capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. In addition, any additional debt arrangements we may enter into would likely require us to make regular interest payments, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to costs or losses from product lines that we intend to exit or may undertake divestiture of portions of our business that require us to continue providing substantial post-divestiture transition services and support, which may cause us to incur unanticipated costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a strategy to exit products that have been declining in revenue and have lower gross margins than our other higher speed products. We may incur additional costs in connection with the sale or end-of-life of these products, or other products and/or facilities in the future, and our revenues and net income could be negatively impacted, particularly in the short term, in connection with the end-of-life or sales of such products and/or facilities. It is also possible that we could incur continued costs or liabilities after the end-of-life process is completed, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nSpending for communications networks is cyclical in nature, and any future downturn may reduce demand for our products and revenue.\nOur future success as a provider of components, modules and subsystems to leading network equipment vendors depends on continued capital spending on global communications networks. Network traffic has experienced rapid growth driven primarily by bandwidth-intensive content, including cloud services, mobile video and data services, wireless 4G/LTE and now 5G services, social networking, video conferencing and other multimedia. This growth is intensified by the proliferation of fixed and wireless devices that are enabling consumers to access content at increasing data rates anytime and anywhere. Our future success depends on continued demand for high-bandwidth, high-speed communications networks and the ability of network equipment vendors and carrier data center operators to fulfill this demand. Our business and financial results will suffer if anticipated growth does not occur as expected.\nThe markets for communications networks and network equipment are cyclical and characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving standards and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. In the past, including recently to varying degrees in China, the U.S. and Europe, these markets have experienced significant downturns,\noften connected with, or in anticipation of, the maturation of product cycles for both manufacturers\u2019 and their customers\u2019 products or in response to over or under purchasing of inventory by our customers relative to end user demand, and with declining general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Our historical results of operations have been subject to substantial fluctuations as a result of market downturns and changes in capital spending, and we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future results of operations.\nRisks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales in various markets, and we have substantial operations in China, Japan and Thailand in addition to the U.S. Our international revenue and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing, managing and supporting operations across different jurisdictions;\n\u2022Difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022Fewer legal protections for intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022International trade restrictions;\n\u2022Difficulties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022Imposition of regulatory restrictions on sales to any of our major customers;\n\u2022Fluctuations in foreign economies and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;\n\u2022Major health events, such as outbreaks of contagious disease;\n\u2022Domestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions; and\n\u2022Difficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international labor standards.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in China, Japan, Canada, Thailand or other countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, higher labor costs and a higher cost of doing business.\nIn addition, although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revenues and costs will fluctuate over time, making it difficult to predict our gross margins and future results of operations.\nOur revenue, gross margin and results of operations have varied significantly and are likely to continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. We may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins because of slow introductions of new products, pricing pressure from increased competition, failure to effectively reduce the cost of existing products, failure to improve our product mix, future macroeconomic or market volatility reducing sales volumes, changes in customer demand (including a change in product mix among different areas of our business) or other factors. Our gross margins can also be adversely affected for reasons including, but not limited to, fixed manufacturing costs that would not be expected to decrease in proportion to any decrease in revenues; unfavorable production yields or variances; increases in costs of input parts and materials; the timing of movements in our inventory balances; warranty costs and related returns; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; possible exposure to inventory valuation reserves; and other increases in our costs and expenses, including as a result of rising labor costs. Such significant increases in costs without corresponding increases in revenue would materially and adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition and our gross margins.\nWe may be involved in intellectual property disputes, which could divert management\u2019s attention, cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology.\nParticipants in the markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous patents in these industries are held by others, including our competitors. In\naddition, from time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others (for example, see our discussion on the Finisar dispute). Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us, whether or not such claims are valid. While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon intellectual property rights of other parties and/or meritorious defense would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, we cannot be certain that our products would not be found infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nAlthough we believe that we would have meritorious defenses to infringement allegations and intend to defend any new lawsuit vigorously, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense. Even if we are successful, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs in defending the lawsuit. Further, a new lawsuit, if brought by either party, would be likely to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations in the U.S. and in other foreign countries, some of which have been issued. We cannot guarantee that our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Additionally, over time, our patents may expire, and we may be unable to secure other intellectual property protections for the technology covered by the expired patents.\nSimilarly, we must protect all company data as it pertains to customers, products and product designs, technology and technology related trade secrets, plus customer and supplier and personal data of suppliers, customers and personnel. We rely on a combination of these important data elements to establish and protect multiple aspects of our business, and loss of data, breaching of data or stealing of such data could hard our business.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections, and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. or Japan law. Particularly, our U.S. patents do not afford any intellectual property protection in China, Japan, Canada, Russia or other Asia locations.\nIn the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed or misappropriated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed.\nIt could be discovered that our products contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention, result in a loss of customers and result in product liability claims.\nOur products are complex and undergo quality testing as well as formal qualification, both by our customers and by us. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. Any significant product failure could result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as customer relations problems and litigation, which could harm our business.\nFurther, our products contain purchased components including electronic components. It is possible that such purchased items could contain quality defects, manufacturing defects, performance problems or even counterfeit substitutes. Any significant product failure that is the result of such defects could result in lost future sales as well as customer relations problems and litigation, which could harm our business.\nOur revenues are typically subject to seasonality.\nOur first quarter revenue is typically seasonally lower than the rest of the year primarily due to annual price negotiations with customers that occur at the end of the prior year and lower capacity utilization during the annual new year holidays in China. This historical pattern typically adversely affects our revenues in the first quarter of each year and impacts the typical annual distribution of revenue from quarter-to-quarter through the year. That said, our first quarter revenue varies markedly year- to-year so should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance.\nIf we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual property rights of others which are necessary to operate our business, and to protect their intellectual property, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time we may choose to, or be required to, license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products. Failure to obtain a necessary third-party license required for our product offerings or to develop new products and product enhancements could adversely affect our business.\nSimilarly, from time to time, others may endeavor to infringe on our intellectual property or encroach on our trademarks or other intellectual property. Our failure to identify, recognize and/or action to protect such intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nParticipation in standards setting organizations may subject us to intellectual property licensing requirements or limitations that could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIn the course of our participation in the development of emerging standards for some of our present and future products, we may agree to grant to all other participants a license to our patents that are essential to the practice of those standards on reasonable and non-discriminatory, or RAND, terms. If we fail to limit to whom we license our patents, or fail to limit the terms of any such licenses, we may be required to license our patents or other intellectual property to others in the future, which could limit the effectiveness of our patents against competitors.\nAny potential dispute involving our products, services or technology could also include our customers using our products, which could trigger our indemnification obligations to them and result in substantial expenses to us.\nIn any potential dispute involving allegations that our products, services or technology infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our customers could also become the target of litigation. Because we often indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims made against them for products incorporating our technology, any claims against our customers could trigger indemnification obligations in some of our supply agreements, which could result in substantial expenses such as increased legal expenses, product recalls, damages for past infringement or royalties for future use.\nRapidly changing standards and regulations could make our products obsolete, which would cause our revenue and results of operations to suffer.\nWe design our products to conform to regulations established by governments and to standards set by industry standards bodies worldwide, such as The American National Standards Institute, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the International Telecommunications Union and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Various industry organizations are currently considering whether and to what extent to create standards for elements used in 100Gbps and beyond systems. Because certain of our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards, if competing or new standards emerge that are preferred by our customers, we would have to make significant expenditures to develop new products and our revenue and results of operations would suffer.\nWe may be unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income taxes, which could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss (\"NOL\"), carryforwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes of $334.2 million and $54.4 million, respectively. These net operating losses have not been utilized and may not be utilized prior to their expiration in the future. The utilization of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a substantial limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. We recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, for the NOL carryforwards currently available after considering the existing Section 382 limitation. If we incur an additional limitation under Section 382, then the NOL carryforwards, as\ndisclosed, could be reduced by the impact of any future limitation that would result in existing NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards expiring unutilized and increases in future tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs, or restrict our business or operations in the future.\nOur manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. Our failure to comply with present and future environmental, health or safety requirements, or the identification of contamination, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, monetary fines, civil or criminal penalties, or curtailment of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases (\"GHG\"), may also impact us. Additional climate change or GHG control requirements are under consideration at the federal level in the U.S. and in China. Additional restrictions, limits, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions could increase our operating costs and, while it is not possible to estimate the specific impact any final GHG regulations will have on our operations, there can be no assurance that these measures will not have significant additional impact on us.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA\nOur business operations conducted in China are critical to our success. A significant portion of our revenue was recognized from customers for whom we shipped products to a location in China. Additionally, a substantial portion of our net property, plant and equipment, approximately 29% as of December 31, 2021, was located in China. We expect to make further investments in China in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are to a significant degree subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in China.\nChanges in China\u2019s international trade policies may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe China government may change trade policies that impact our operations. Prior to early 2020, the China government imposed tariffs on certain of our products manufactured in our U.S. operations and imported into China from the United States. There has been exemption of these tariffs since then. We expect these tariffs, if applied without exemption, will increase our cost of goods sold. It is unknown if exemption, or any additional such tariffs or retaliatory actions, will be imposed or what impact they would have on us or our industry and customers. As new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated between China and the U.S. or other affected countries, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, in response to such trade tensions, the Chinese government and/or individual Chinese customers may take steps to reduce their supply chain dependence on products from U.S. suppliers through their own internal developments or the selection of non-U.S. suppliers, placing us at a commercial disadvantage and potentially affecting our business.\nA considerable portion of our business outside of the Cloud and data center market segments involves selling high-speed optical components in China and any move to local Chinese vendors for these products might adversely affect our results.\nIn December 2017, the Chinese Government Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced a five-year optical component technology roadmap with the aim to reduce China\u2019s dependency on non-domestic companies for high-end optical chips and sub-components, including some products manufactured and sold by us. This announcement continues an ongoing trend in China to build domestic industry in this area. While we believe local Chinese component suppliers do not currently have the capability to supply the highest performance optical chips and sub-components, those companies are actively investing in their development and may over time develop such capability and negatively impact our revenue and financial performance if we do not continue to innovate and maintain our lead in the highest speed and performance optical components.\nAdverse changes in economic and political policies in China, or Chinese laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on business conditions and the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Chinese government exercises significant control over China\u2019s economy by way of the allocation of resources, control over foreign currency-denominated obligations and monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Moreover, the laws, regulations and legal requirements in China, including the laws that apply to foreign-invested enterprises are relatively new and are subject to frequent changes. The interpretation and enforcement of such\nlaws is uncertain. Any adverse changes to these laws, regulations and legal requirements, including tax laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, or the creation of new laws or regulations relating to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, any slowdown or economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, in China could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nUncertainties with respect to China\u2019s legal system could adversely affect the legal protection available to us.\nOur operations in China are governed by Chinese laws and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. China's laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Uncertainties in the Chinese legal system may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into with our distributors, business partners, customers and suppliers. In addition, protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions. All of these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use our cash effectively.\nIn China, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\"SAFE\") administers restrictions on currency exchange. These restrictions may limit our ability to use cash held in RMB to fund any business activities we may have outside China or to make dividend payments in U.S. dollars. SAFE or other Chinese regulatory authorities may impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions. If such restrictions are imposed, our ability to adjust our capital structure or engage in foreign exchange transactions may be limited.\nIf the Chinese government determines that we failed to obtain approvals of, or registrations with, the requisite Chinese regulatory authority with respect to our current and past import and export of technologies, or failed to obtain the necessary licenses to file patent applications outside China for inventions made in China, we could be subject to sanctions, which could adversely affect our business.\nChina imposes controls on technology import and export. The term \u201ctechnology import and export\u201d is broadly defined to include, without limitation, the transfer or license of patents, software and know-how, and the provision of services in relation to technology. Depending on the nature of the relevant technology, the import and export of technology to or from China requires either approval by or registration with, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities. Additionally, the Chinese government requires the patent application for any invention made at least in part in China to be filed first in China, then undergo a government secrecy review and obtain a license before such application is filed in other countries.\nIf the Chinese government determines that we failed to follow required procedures and obtain the appropriate license before filing a patent application outside China for an invention made at least in part in China, our China patents on such products may be invalidated, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"FCPA\") and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and we make significant sales in China. China also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to discourage these practices by our employees, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or anti-corruption laws in other countries may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be volatile due to fluctuation of our financial results from quarter-to-quarter and other factors.\nOur quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from\nquarter-to-quarter. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors, including:\n\u2022Developments or announcements regarding the Merger;\n\u2022Our ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the components used in our products;\n\u2022Fluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u2022The timing, volume and product mix of sales of our products;\n\u2022Changes in our pricing and sales policies, particularly in the first quarter of the year, or changes in the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;\n\u2022Changes in government export and import laws, rules, and regulations that restrict our sales to key customers;\n\u2022Our ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner and that meet customer requirements;\n\u2022Quality control, yield or other output-related problems in our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022Length and variability of the sales cycles of our products;\n\u2022Unanticipated increases in costs or expenses; and\n\u2022Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations in the future. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our internal manufacturing, research and development, sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Moreover, our results of operations may not meet our announced financial outlook or the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us.\nThe stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, sovereign debt or liquidity issues, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022Providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022Not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022Authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022Prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022Limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022Requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and\nunder Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings:\n\u2022Any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022Any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022Any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law; and\n\u2022Any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nGENERAL RISKS\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Preparing our consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and require significant management judgment. One or more of these elements may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, our business and operating results may be harmed and we may fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. If material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure of our internal controls could adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock may decline.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations and our financial results.\nOur worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters and wafer fabrication facility in Silicon Valley, California and our Tokyo, Japan facility are located near major earthquake fault lines, and our manufacturing facilities are located in Shenzhen and Dongguan, China, areas that are susceptible to typhoons. We are not insured against many natural disasters, including earthquakes. Similarly, our worldwide operations could be subject to secondary effects of natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. Even if our facilities are not directly affected, any of these types of events could substantially disrupt the business of our suppliers or customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 12559, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "NPTN"}
